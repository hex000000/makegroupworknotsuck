One of the practical challenges to both students and researchers using the Repertory Grid Technique is the difficulty of large-scale comparison without installing and using the RepPlus software.
The software is easy to install, compatible with Mac, PC, and as a Windows Server instance [RepPlus](repppa00000.shared.sydney.edu.au). The software is available to download from the [RepPlus website](https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/repplus/markdown-4/). It is 32-bit and will not run under the newest Mac OS release 'Catalina'.

With this in mind, I am working on simple workflows to gather and aggregate RepGrid data in ways other than RepPlus, as well as RepPlus.
