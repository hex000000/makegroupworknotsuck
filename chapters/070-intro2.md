What is the best way to find out what a person thinks? While it sounds like a simple question, the answers that we have to date remain uncertain and inconsistent. Even more impenetrable are those things people aren't aware that they think. Most difficult of all is to understand the cause of those thoughts; why they think what they think. Yet all these are the daily concerns of higher education researchers, instructors and learners. Myriad forms of research strive to find practices that help students and their teachers find productive ground, and the field is expanding day by day as cheaper and more accessible technologies offer different forms of data collection and analysis. Emergent fields like the Learning Sciences blend theoretical and methodological approaches from multiple disciplines with the aim of addressing the whole "ecology" that exists outside the learner's formal educational environment. When combined, this broader scope and more complex data creates nuanced research that tends to focus tightly on a limited number of people, or a small excerpt of transcript, or a brief period of time, to be manageable within current work and research workloads and budgets. Teachers (and researchers) don't have a lot of time.

Much of this research is intersted in process.
