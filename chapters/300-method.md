## Analysis
In {Burke, 1992 #3505}, a SOCIOGRIDS mode grid was created for the group for each data collection, with the elements based on teacher, student, family member and self over past, present and future. From that, the 11 most similarly construed constructs were represented in a MODE grid with the aim of identifying those construct relevant at different times during the transition to teaching.  As (Pope 7 Keen 1981) mention, because these are the most similar responses, they tend to be closely related. The constructs found tended to be simple qualities associated with each role rather than sentences or statements. The researchers found that at in three groups _present self_, _ideal self_ and _TAFE student_, there was a difference in rating at all data collection points, concluding this indicated a progression through role understanding and associated constructs consistent with a positive personal transition to the role of teacher. No significant change was found with wither of the self-esteem and family relationship instruments administered at the same times. From a methodological point of view, the 11-element grid took around an hour to complete because of difficulty distinguishing between similar elements and because participants were not always focused on the grid process. Their study went for three years with data collection at 6-monthly points, but was not administered in the first six months of the program as it was considered a lack of experience with the elements (the range of convenience) would be problematic, although in their hindsight it would have added an interesting dimension. The authors acknowledge that providing individual feedback to participants about their grids may have added flexibility in changing both elements and constructs over time, with this study preferencing a larger dataset over a smaller number of participants. Despite this limitation, the constructs used in this study are now used in other, non RepGrid, research. 

In {Candy, 1985 #314}, the group with a facilitator decided which were representative of that team.
