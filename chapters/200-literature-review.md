First I did a scope of all the Gaines &  Shaw documents, assigning a Yes to further review if (a) included RepGrid & relevant. A list of those included and omitted is at Appendix N.
Did a mad word cloud on all MyYes documents. Not super-helpful.

## a cognitive mirror {Shaw, 1978 #19} p62

In 1978, the Centre for the Study of Human Learning at Brunel University in the United Kingdom began to develop methods for encouraging learner self-organisation with the aim of enabling more successful learning {Shaw, 1978 #19}. The method used is a conversational dialogue which guided learners though the construction of concept models reflecting the ways they construe experience {Shaw, 1978 #19}. [Do I need to define construing here? keep an eye out for a Gaines/Shaw definition] This method was initially applied in several areas extending beyond learning skills, to psychotherapy, recruitment, manufacturing, art, architecture, equipment maintenance, career guidance, and learning for both children and teachers {Shaw, 1978 #19}. As learning necessarily involves changes in how we construe reality, the representations reflect more nuanced thinking as new differentiations are made, and the learner is able to observe their own progress supported by the softare in a way that humans would do more slowly and less accurately {Shaw, 1978 #19}.

## how does it work?
Based on the Repertory Grid Technique, a software application was designed to use _conversational heuristics_ [Definition here] to prompt user responses independent of content {Shaw, 1978 #19}. The ideal of modelling reality is based in Kelly's proposition that people have a mental model of reality (like Bateson's Map) that they use to make predictions about what will happen when they do things, and that the quality of this model is related to successful competences and creativity {Shaw, 1978 #19}.

We won't talk a lot in detail about the programming of the early software versions.

Shaw describes the repertory grid as a "conversational tool to help people become more aware of the paterns of thought and feeling implicit in their responses" {Shaw, 1978 #19} p59, therefore a metacognitive process that is not discipline-specific.  The metacognitive aspect is amplified by the output of a computer model of thinking structures that then operates as a conversational FOCUS [take out caps later when connected to explanation of FOCUS] {Shaw, 1978 #19}. A key feature of the process is real-time feedback from the application PEGASUS [take out etc] {Shaw, 1978 #19}, allowing almost-immediate refinement and disambiguation of constructs even without a human interviewer.

FOCUS has significant potential as a metacognitive tool, with the process of elicitation and the representation of individual responses as patterns both leading to personal insights {Shaw, 1978 #19}. In the elicitation process, internal and tacit knowledge may come forward, and as the language is that of the participant, it has a validity that would not be possible with a "normalisation" of responses along a continuum that doesn't represent the participant's way of making meaning {Shaw, 1978 #19}. This personal meaningfulness is also important in the grid representations, with their original responses retained and simply re-presented sorted to reflect clustered groups of similar constructs {Shaw, 1978 #19}. The importance of this feedback to internal knowledge re-construction was demonstrated in [Keen 1977].

Beyond individuals, SOCIOGRIDS [take out etc] can aggregate multiple responses, and identify shared elements, indicating where participants are construing in a similar way {Shaw, 1978 #19}, and by comparing these over time, it is possible to observe where and when changes to these constructs occur.



## elements and constructs
The procedure involves an explanation of the process, and the provision or elicitation of _elements_ {Shaw, 1978 #19}, in Kelly's work these tended to be people, in an educational context these are likely to be concepts. This is followed by the elicitation of _constructs_, the ways in which these elements are construed by the participant {Shaw, 1978 #19}. {Shaw, 1978 #19} emphasises that the elements need to be relevant to the purpose of the exercise, and they need to "represent as fully as possible the universe of discourse which is to be explored" {Shaw, 1978 #19} p 63. When the system detects two constructs being used similarly (that is, when the respondent applies them in the same way to the same element), the user is asked to disambiguate them by either merging them or changing the way they are referred to to draw out the difference that makes a difference (Bateson again). In the 1978 version, when elements are being construed similarly, the user is asked to add a construct which separates them in the sense that there is a continuum with one element at each _pole_{Shaw, 1978 #19}.


## what do the representations mean?

Traditionally, Repertory Grids have been analysed using factor analysis,  principal component analysis, and multi-dimensional scaling {Shaw, 1978 #19}. In the FOCUS program, more recent methods of cluster analysis are used, speeifically, a non-inclusive two-way cluster analysis developed by the Centre {Shaw, 1978 #19}. This design was selected in order to retain the raw data (avoiding interviewer/researcher interpretation bias), while at the same time showing, through re-ordering the list , the responses that are most statistically similar {Shaw, 1978 #19}. The representation allows the participant to see how this similarlity was calculated {Shaw, 1978 #19}. Where participants rate things similarly, a visual marker shows where they are similar, working through each element progressively until the most different are determined {Shaw, 1978 #19}.

## how can it be helpful?

The early PEGASUS-BANK (and hopefully something more recent), can contain an _expert_ model of what might be thought of as the _ideal_ concept construction map. As participants engage in RepGrid exercises, they (and a OLM system) can get feedback on their progress towards expertise {Shaw, 1978 #19}. Paired with an OLM, it is possible to provide targeted feedback based on the relationship of the participant responses to the ideal. Even when participants use construct labels which are not conceptually or literally recognisable as similar, if two participants rate the same elements in the same way with different labels, the chances are the labels mean similar things {Shaw, 1978 #19}. {Shaw, 1978 #19} provides a relatable example:

      One example is that of a grid using animals as elements. The biologist had elicited a grid which was stored in the bank, the user had elicited a construct which he called: 'horrible creepy crawlies - nice, soft cuddly ones'. The computer's feedback response was that 'horrible creepy crawlies' was highly matched with the biologist's term 'arachnida', and 'nice, soft cuddly ones' was being called 'warm-blooded mammals'. {Shaw, 1978 #19} p 66; {Shaw, 1978 #194} p 127.

This clear representation of alignment can operate as a useful metacognitive tool for reflection and learning, and can be combined with other application features to identify patterns and measure overlaps and/or gaps in shared construing {Shaw, 1978 #19}. For example, if a third user elicited a construct using the _animals_ elements above which was 'scary - friendly', and their ratings aligned 'scary' with 'warm-blooded mammals' and 'friendly' with 'arachnida', it is likely that have either misunderstood the instructions, or have a very different way of construing animals than their peers in that universe of discourse. This facilitates critical thinking, and is also compatible with the idea of Productive Failure [Jacobsen/Kapur unpacked here or elsewhere]  _Mode_ grids can easily be assembled that show the most common construals by members of a group {Shaw, 1978 #19}, which can be a useful tool for making decisions in teams. For example, if tasked with deciding on a particular acquisition, the options can be provided as elements, and the constructs can provide insight into how the team members both individually and at a group level think about those options, in a quantitative form that allows individual expression in a neutral and controlled procedure. This can be framed within a Delphi technique process {Shaw, 1978 #19}, which is a common method for group decision-making.

Another insight-developing use for RepGrid is a development on the psychotherapy model of conversations with several roles within one individual {Shaw, 1978 #19}, to an individual filling out several grids as if they were someone else. _Exchange grids_ ask participants to complete grids (a) themselves as they think, (b) themselves as they think others think they'll think, (c) another person as the other person thinks, (d) the other person as they other imagines the first person will think. This foregrounds assumptions and presuppositions which may otherwise interfere with open and constructive communication.

When Mildred Shaw developed the WebGrid software, she was guided by the key principles of George Kelly's Personal Construct Theory [Double-check this terminology as it may not be interchangeable] {Shaw, 1978 #194}. These corollaries are:
[need Kelly here]

Grid analysis is based on general statistical methods, in particularly the similarity and correlation matrices between the columns of elements and rows of constructs {Shaw, 1978 #194}. Traditionally, multi-dimensional scaling, principal component analysis, factor analysis and cluster analysis are used to interrogate grid data, and Shaw finds that despite limitations of psycho-physical scales generally, the mathematical process for focusing the grid is robust {Shaw, 1978 #194}.


Remember broader coding schema development for the previous project which may still be relevant is at MaxMaps.

In each document, scan abstract first for "repertory grid", then establish setting. [not to self about auto-coding the list of knowledge acquisition/elicitation terms] While AI and personal and inter-personal reflection not in a HE setting are outside the scope of this review, they are important in a Learning Sciences frame and are discussed further in the Literture Review chapter. Also review the term 'entailment' in this context. Also need to create a new code for Expert Systems and go back over this and other document sets after the SSR is complete. Expertise modelling. Deeper think about the idea of mapping through the tools specifically as envisaged for collaboration. Also go back through SG for tools specifically as most of their work develops in that direction.

Knowledge structures - need to address the idea of "knowledge". Shaw "Active Documents" code these as meeting support and go back to Zacklad etc. for LR chapter. In my my mind I am creating an expert model in RepGrid then ABM, then animating the steps toward and distance from that model, and the way this can feed into AI. But I was thinking of something else first. And all these documents are knowledge models of a sort. Shaw very much about tracking the development of collaborative semantic networks. also conversation heuristics, decision/collaboration support.

{Candy, 1985 #314} demonstrated the power of using Repertory Grid Technique for team building. In their study of higher education support staff, each group member completed a repertory grid with the aid of a facilitator interviewer. Their grids were then represented back to them in the FOCUS cluster analysis format, and they were encouraged to reflect on them, and if comfortable, to discuss the differences and similarities with others'. While this study also used other instruments including a Myers-Briggs test and researcher observations to ensure validity, participants reported both at the time of administration and in a follow up interview that they process accurately represented their constructs and that additional meanings were revealed through the process making it an essential part of the intervention. In the role-based survey, they included generic "good" elements to ensure a truer polarity, which participants also found useful as they were able to understand that others construed those roles differently, which led to productive interactions. This study found the three most relevant corollaries were (1) individuality - demonstrated by the diversity of constructs over people who worked together over a long period of time; (2) commonality - demonstrated through those aspects which were collective; and (3) sociality - here the outcome of people in interdependent roles making sense of each other's perspectives.  Their aim was to evaluate the use of RepGrid for group learning, and to export progressive grid refinement to foster team function. They also aimed to explicate the relevance of PCT in group situation from a constructivist perspective. After conducting the grid surveys and using the data to create individual FOCUS cluster representations the participants were asked to clarify the meanings of all constructs that had been contributed, and distil them into 15 collectively agreed, which were then used for a second survey data collection. Unfortunately the study data is not reported in this paper.  
{Candy, 1980 #143} earlier set out the theoretical alignment between learning as as constructivist process and Kelly's _Experience_ corollary, in which Kelly says that following the _Fundamental Postulate_ position of "anticipation of events as the objective of psychological processes", the "successive revelation of events [through experience] invites the person to place new constructions upon them when something unexpected [ie new or different] happens" {Kelly, 1955 #6524} (pp51-52) is 'learning' (emphasis in original) (p 53). This epistemological position considers that learning is "synonymous with any and all psychological processes", and at the core of being a person. This study takes the Kellyian position deliberately, as not only the simplest explanation unencumbered by additional theoretical complication, but also as a holistic perspective encompassing all aspects of the learner and their experience of the world. [this work also has a long appendix of work related to PCT in education, of which many may now be inaccessible.]


{Thomas, 1985 #1145} Self Organised Learning approach draws strongly from Personal Construct Theory, and their work heavily influenced by Fransella & Bannister. Their book is a comprehensive account of using the Repertory Grid Technique for "Learning Conversations" with Open University Students in the UK.

{Burke, 1992 #3505} used a repeated-measures grid with commencing trades instructors around role-based self-contruals, for example, the ideal teacher, me as I am now. Refers to the transition model by James & Venables (1981). Average age 33, so more generalisable to our Masters level students. Refers to the body of work on trainee primary and secondary teachers by Diamond (1982, 1983, 1984) around how they construed themselves and others. Pope (1978) used the case study method to argue that teachers' perspectives were influenced by the role attributes they found personally meaningful. In O'Connor's (1983) social work study, she showed [follow up] that students adopted a social work system of meaning (eb the sociality corollary). He used typical work situations as elements to elicit constructs and at the end of the course student responses were aligned to the model. Cunliffe, A. (1992). Images of science teaching: An exploration of the beliefs of preservice secondary science teachers. Research in Science Education, 22(1), 408. doi:10.1007/BF02356923 is an abstract/research note only, Cunliffe, A. (1994). How Do Science Teachers Become Professionals? Implications of Case Studies of Two Beginning Teachers. extends to in-service, Cunliffe, A. (1995). How Do My Students Believe They Learn?  about secondary students.  

Work by O'Connor needs to be followed up

Back to Burke; we will follow {Burke, 1992 #3505}--> see method

{Cunliffe, 1996 #97} used RepGrid as a complementary method to concept mapping and stimulated recall interviews  in their study of pre- and in-service teacher, following Zuber-Skerrit 1988, Diamond 1983  with a role-based grid including past and future self as teacher as elements. Triadic elicitation produced individual constructs and FOCUS grids were generated for each participant at each data collection point, with the aim of finding the conceptions participants initially held and any change that can be observed in subsequent surveys.  Cunliffe's case study approach clustered the results of all methods for each participant, making it difficult to get a clear picture across the grid data, but at the same time the method allowed in-depth study which the author points out is balanced by the increased validity of survey results as they can be elaborated at an individual interview. It is fair to say that most authors prefer this validation mechanism where it is possible (Candy 1985) but acknowledge that time constraints mean this does not always occur. While this study did not offer the participants representations of grid comparison to reflect on, they suggest this would be a useful method for critical reflection. [Tobin RepGrid study he refers to is in-service teaching, (Cunliffe 5-point scale; {Phillips, 1980 #1087} not the one in the refs here but is the same paper/chapter also 5 point)]

{Denicolo, 2001 #785} discuss from a professional education perspective how the need for interconnectedness between professions, disciplines and agencies points to changes in the way (particularly health and social) workers view their own work and that of others. It follows that the case studies they describe, and many other studies using Personal Construct Theory (or PCP), use role-based surveys as their principal method. This book pointed me to an unpublished thesis which I will order from the Library. "Wu, Chi-Yi (1997) A constructivist approach to the study of career decision-making: a sample of senior undergraduate students in Taiwan. Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Reading." Pope's book is a comprehensive integration of professional education philosophy with Personal Construct Pscyhology, and while not included in the SSR because it only mentions the Wu study without enough details to know if it is within scope, it sits with Candy and Harri-Augstein as the solid theoretical underpinnings of post-1980 work on Repertory Grid Technique in education.

In {Diamond, 1989 #7580} study of the intentions of teachers completing their training, a role-based instrument was used, but different from the traditional grid form enough to be excluded from this study. There was no repeated measure and the grid was used for survey only. [SSR] {Gilfillan, 2003 #82} also used a role-based grid with self- as element in their study of teachers before and after a professional development intervention. Again this study extends beyond the education context into professional reflection using nominal group technique, stimulated recall interviews, personal life histories and metaphors of self as teacher [references this book Handbook of research on teaching

{Happs, 1989 #3609}


Want to discuss whether the grid is about PCP or PCT. Is there a difference in the studies that is associated with this term?

Also something missed so far is that some studies to triadic elicitation with the same versus different, some and different versus same (odd one out). What work on this re effect of changing?

What new representations are possible?

Ca
Limitations are that RepGrid is used so often with other interventions it is difficult to have a method or data collection recipe that hasn't another ingredient in it {Candy} above used MBTI, {Andrews, 1998 #93} study of overseas students used Witkin's Group Embedded Figures Test {Burke, 1992 #3505} the Rosenberg Self Esteem Questionnaire and Family Relationships Questionnaire,
which means there's often an explicit or implied sense of power-distance positioning, which may not work well for educational contexts.   
Have to admire the variety of combinations which have been used.
Ridiculously hard to get works through library, cost attached, time delay of months
