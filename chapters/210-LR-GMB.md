# Literature Review 1: Group Model Building in higher education

This review summarises the research identified by the initial search parameters of this proposal: group learning in higher education through collaborative modelling. It describes the broader global context of complex systems, and the changing understanding of what knowledge might be and how we might develop it though learning with others. We briefly review previous studies on collaborative learning in a university context and summarise the key findings about epistemic and regulative learner interactions associated with effective knowledge object co-construction (as a group) and then outline the research evidence in relation to socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL). We then extend the review outside universities for studies around collaborative complex problem solving that use group modelling as a mechanism for knowledge co-construction. We look in depth at two important university studies that report on how learners interact within designed environments doing a group project, the manner in which they appropriate its features to make them more useful, and the ways in which those actions may be both qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. This leads to a brief overview of learning environment design features that may be an appropriate fit for a similar study in our context, and the way in which the collected data can be used as a developmental tool for both learners and instructors.

## Complex global issues and distributed teamwork require a new kind of graduate

In our connected and globalised world, work is changing both in its nature and in its structure. Where previously we as individuals might address problems to which there are known solutions, our work is now to address increasingly complex problems with no known solutions, collaboratively with diverse and complex sets of stakeholders {Yoon, 2018 #9207}. Organisations now engage with distributed and often virtual teams {Nedic, 2011 #7944;Cochrane, 2008 #7966}, meaning team members work across cultures and disciplines, with divergent experiences, mental models, and ways of knowing and doing {Ananth, 2011 #7750}. When recruiting graduates, these organisations now foreground the ability to work in teams {Lawrie, 2010 #8422;Pearce, 2007 #7872} and across cultural boundaries {Richards, 2012 #7835} as important professional skills in addition to domain and discipline knowledge. These "soft skills" of intercultural and interdisciplinary effectiveness are are a key component of the graduate skillset at the University of Sydney {University of Sydney, 2019 #6588} and more broadly {Cook, 2018 #8131}, and there is continuing discussion how they may be embedded and evidenced {Barrie, 2009 #1939;Cook, 2018 #8131}. To be equipped for life after university, our students need to emerge from higher education as a new kind of graduate, with broad practical skills in creating new ways of working together and an understanding of how to weave together diverse forms of knowledge and ways of knowing {Markauskaite, 2016 #8517}.

## The evolution of what &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; might mean

What "knowledge" is, and how it might be "learned", is the subject of constant research. In their critique of traditional conceptions of learning, {Bereiter, 1996 #1174;Bereiter, 2002 #9205} discussed how the western metaphor of &quot;mind as container&quot; is incompatible with knowledge embedded in practice (such as the best way to cross a busy road), or embedded in material items that are not knowledge themselves, but contain knowledge that relates to the physical world or cognitive concepts (such as books or tools). Andy Clark  extended the concept of knowledge across the socio-technical-cultural landscape, arguing that our minds are biologically evolved for &quot;profound reconfiguration&quot; by a network of culture, education, technology and artefacts {Clark, 2003 #7745;Clark, 2011 #7010}. More recently, researchers in 4E Cognition argue that our sensorimotor systems determine our cognition through both computational and  non-computational processes {Newen, 2018 #8398;Fiore, 2019 #8399} and that its embodied, embedded, extended, and enactive aspects are entwined with our environment and organised by biological principles {Newen, 2018 #8398}. We have moved from a focus on acquiring "knowledge" through repetitive practice to acknowledging that "learning" involves mental and social processes that are situated, distributed and contextual, mediated by tools that are inevitably cultural {Fischer, 2018 #9203}, and that the &quot;knowledge&quot; output of these processes extends beyond individual persons&#39; inner worlds to memory extensions such as a list of definitions, complex systems like mathematics or networks, and creative works such as art and music {Fischer, 2018 #9203}. We now know people understand, organise and express what they think about in a multitude of different ways; both psychologically and physiologically, not predictable linear paths or static archives but a series of inter-related systems that are dynamic and responsive to feedback. These systems include not only people, but also the physical, digital and unquantifiable experiences of being.

The evolution of learning sciences research has not been without tension between the cognitive and sociocultural approaches. While both emphasise the construction (or building) of new knowledge, the _cognitivist_ approach understands knowledge to be an individual structure, and interactions with others occur principally to support a measure of individual growth {Fischer, 2018 #9203}. One example of this is the widely-used _Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Domains_ which has three dimensions, one of which is cognitive, and you may be familiar with its original categories: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation {Bloom, 1956 #6474} (pp 201-207),  or the revised categories: remember, understand, apply, analyse, evaluate and create {Anderson, 2000 #8402} (pp 63-92) ***insert figure here instead of spelling out in text***. In its original form, the taxonomy - developed for a "rapidy changing and unpredictable culture" tasked educators to "prepare _individuals_ for problems that can not be seen in advance" (p40) (my emphasis). In contrast, the _sociocultural_ approach 




## What we know about creating new knowledge with others

Understanding how learning occurs in situations where students work on a task as part of a group is even more complex. Systematic research has been impeded by the various inconsistent terminologies used to describe learning together, with {Goodsell, 1992 #8478} describing the range of activities as comprising co-operative learning, problem-centred instruction, writing groups; peer teaching, discussion groups and seminars; and learning communities. More recently, we discuss &quot;collaborative&quot; {Goodyear, 2010 #156;Isohätälä, 2017 #9209;Järvelä, 2013 #9211;Järvelä, 2014 #9210;Panadero, 2015 #9212;Malmberg, 2017 #9208}, &quot;cooperative&quot;, &quot;peer&quot; or &quot;small-group&quot; learning {Almajed, 2015 #7919}, &quot;collaborative knowledge-building&quot; {Goodyear, 2007 #1101}, &quot;teamwork and collaboration&quot; {Cunningham, 2016 #7914;Luca, 2001 #7894;Tyler, 2010 #7953}, &quot;teamwork&quot; {Tucker, 2016 #7915;Richards, 2012 #7835;Cochrane, 2008 #7966}, &quot;peer-driven interaction&quot; {Reilly, 2016 #7916}, &quot;collaborative [group] learning&quot; {Stacey, 2005 #7978;Parkes, 2010 #7950;Clear, 2005 #7981;Pearce, 2007 #7872}, &quot;group problem solving&quot; {Chalmers, 2009 #7958}, &quot;group-work&quot; {Tempone, 1999 #8423}, &quot;collaboration&quot; {Ng, 2008 #7963}, &quot;collaborative work&quot; {Limbu, 2015 #8539}, &quot;collaborative group work&quot; {Norton, 2007 #7969} among others. These can be considered more tightly construed definitions of a process other authors have described as &quot;an umbrella term for a variety of educational approaches involving the joint intellectual effort by students, or students and teachers together&quot; {Smith, 1992 #8479@11}, or even more broadly &quot;a situation in which two or more people learn or attempt to learn something together&quot; {Dillenbourg, 1999 #8482@1}.

The generalisability of studies is constrained both by the wide range of settings and the divergent theoretical perspectives that have informed them learning {Almajed, 2015 #7919;Dillenbourg, 1999 #8482}. This has led to different views in relation to both quality and quantity of effective research on how people learn in groups. Some consider &quot;research on cooperative learning is one of the greatest success stories in the history of educational  research&quot; {Slavin, 1996 #8491@43}, with &quot;an extraordinary number of field experiments of high methodological quality&quot; {Slavin, 1996 #8491@64}, while others describe a lack of sufficient academic rigour or methodological quality {Almajed, 2015 #7919}.

Within the accessible body of research, studies around the importance of collaboration are most often situated within the _constructivist_ {Stratilas, 2012 #7941;Almajed, 2015 #7919;Chalmers, 2009 #7958} or _constructionist_ paradigms {Parkes, 2010 #7950}, even if this is not specifically articulated {Richards, 2012 #7835;Luca, 2001 #7894}. Similar studies articulate their position in social constructivism {Stacey, 2005 #7978;Reilly, 2016 #7916;Ng, 2008 #7963} and/or situated learning {Stacey, 2005 #7978}. The theoretical proposition that individuals and groups &quot;construct&quot; learning through making meaning from the interactions between their inner and outer worlds and the abstract and concrete processes that mediate them dominates current pedagogies {Fischer, 2018 #9203;Cress, 2018 #9204}. The intention for collaboration is to increase the number and complexity of mutual, interdependent goal-oriented interactions, for example, disagreement resulting in elaboration, resulting in more or different learning for everyone {Dillenbourg, 1999 #8482}, creating solutions that could not be arrived at by one person alone {Johnson, 1999 #8528}. However, there is no guarantee that this kind of learning will occur {Bereiter, 2002 #9205}, no universally accepted method or measure for determining successful outcomes, and often no purpose for the created knowledge object after its submission for assessment.

Social interaction is important for the knowledge-focused aspect of learning together. {Damşa, 2010 #1891} and {Damşa, 2014 #1098} found that the groups who engaged in _epistemic_ (knowledge) actions as well as _regulative_ (process) actions created richer knowledge objects than the group which focused on regulative activities. But intentional actions in both dimensions are required to produce shared epistemic agency (SEA), a group phenomenon related to collective cognitive and metacognitive activity and to self-management of productive engagement {Damşa, 2010 #1891}. Learners must engage in self-management, planning and monitoring progress on the group task, all of which fluctuate between individual and internal and shared and public as the group works though a problem-solving task {Panadero, 2015 #9212;Hadwin, 2018 #9217}. The social aspect is situated in individual learners&#39; cultural and historical experiences, with socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) characterised as context-specific negotiated attention to the cognitive, behavioural, motivational, and emotional states within the group {Hadwin, 2018 #9217}. It is context-specific because of the unique nature of each group&#39;s divergent individual thoughts and experiences. Its key feature is intentional co-emergence, managed informally and jointly and without specific guidance {Hadwin, 2018 #9217}. Although the field is still developing, SSRL is associated with full participation in group interactions t, and support for the cognitive, motivational and emotional challenges of collaboration in CSCL through provision of technological and other affordances {Järvelä, 2014 #9210}. Its importance is highlighted by what we know about the learner experience of collaboration.

## Important themes across collaboration research

While we have found that approaches to researching collaboration vary, there is some consistency across what is reported from learner perspective. Students recognise the value of diverse ideas and the new knowledge that is constructed {Tucker, 2016 #7915;Almajed, 2015 #7919;Stratilas, 2012 #7941;Cunningham, 2016 #7914}, but still express preferences for individual work {Cunningham, 2016 #7914;Lawrie, 2010 #8422}. Students connect learning gains and positive attitudes with groups that work well together {Lawrie, 2010 #8422}, and consistent concerns are raised by students about how much and in what way each member contributes to the group, and the fairness of group assessment {Cunningham, 2016 #7914;Tucker, 2016 #7915;De Grave, 2002 #8530;Almajed, 2015 #7919}. Students are also concerned about group leadership {Cunningham, 2016 #7914;Tucker, 2016 #7915;De Grave, 2002 #8530;Almajed, 2015 #7919;Clear, 2005 #7981;Hendry, 2005 #8532;Hendry, 2003 #8531;Ng, 2008 #7963}, with many studies highlighting the need for effective facilitation {Cunningham, 2016 #7914;Tucker, 2016 #7915;De Grave, 2002 #8530;Almajed, 2015 #7919}. International students can be particularly reluctant to engage in group discussion {Norton, 2007 #7969}, particularly if their English language skills are limited {Almajed, 2015 #7919;Parkes, 2010 #7950}. {Stratilas, 2012 #7941} survey indicated that 8.7% of their International student respondents &quot;never&quot; worked with others to prepare assessment tasks (p. 287), and other studies highlight &quot;dread&quot;, &quot;marginalisation&quot;, or finding the situations &quot;problematic&quot; even when all learners are operating in their second language {Norton, 2007 #7969@1}. International students who have unsatisfactory group experiences are also less likely to engage in future group activities {Stratilas, 2012 #7941}. This makes it clear that for group work environments to be conducive to collaborative construction of knowledge, they must be designed to facilitate equitable contribution and productive interactions for both epistemic and regulative tasks.

Collaborative processes have also been studied from a purely professional practice point of view {Chalmers, 2009 #7958;Pearce, 2007 #7872}, but the disciplinary bases including sociology, psychology and anthropology {Slavin, 1996 #8491}, philosophy, cognitive psychology and adult learning {Stacey, 2005 #7978} situate teamwork in a personal and public human developmental space shared by both learners and instructors. These frameworks around how people learn individually and in groups have extended beyond the boundaries of traditional &quot;information transmission&quot; education to become philosophical in nature, encompassing conversations about the nature of reality and knowledge, and the forms of human interaction with the rich social, natural and technological environment we inhabit {Fischer, 2018 #9203;Wilson, 1998 #146;Clark, 2003 #7745;Chalmers, 2009 #7958}.

The Learning Sciences has emerged as an interdisciplinary locus which embraces the complex systems nature of learning by integrating these diverse theoretical perspectives, innovating pedagogical approaches that make learning more productive, and designing methods that allow meaningful research to be undertaken in complex environments {Kolodner, 2018 #9134}. This stance bridges two complementary views. From an epistemic viewpoint, learning can be an object of research from multiple perspectives (for example, comparing how we apply new knowledge to a very similar task, compared to a very different one). From a systems perspective, learning results from mental and social processes, practices and tools across space and time {Fischer, 2018 #9114}. To scientifically observe and measure what occurs in these processes requires intentional design of the learning environment with specific goals in mind, and clearly articulated mechanisms by which we think those might be achieved {Vogel, 2018 #9206}. But if this is only linear &quot;event-oriented&quot; thinking {Morecroft, 2007 #356}, that is, if our design is to put people in groups and assert they will learn more as a direct result, it is limited in both scope and validity. The learning group itself is a complex systems phenomenon {Fischer, 2018 #9114}, which requires systems feedback thinking if we are to make sense of the larger systems of which our (learner, group and instructor) goal is one part among many {Senge, 1992 #9135}. We need to take a Learning Sciences design approach to collaboration while solving complex problems to address both epistemic (learning) and systems (feedback) dimensions.

## A systems modelling approach to learning &amp; design

Systems thinking differs from event-oriented thinking in its encompassing of feedback as a variable, showing causal relationships between the parts, their direction and impact, over time {Morecroft, 2007 #356}. This shows what linear thinking can not: how the solution affects the problem or goal. This is a fundamental conceptual framework needed not only by those who design learning situations, but also for the learners themselves, who will emerge in to a world overwhelmed by complexity {Senge, 1992 #9135}, collaboratively solving problems characterised by &quot;connectedness, complexity, conflict, multiple perspectives and stakeholdings&quot; {Ison, 2008 #336@146}. Global concerns such as climate change, pandemics or financial crises need solutions that cross multiple conceptual boundaries and established design models {Engeström, 2010 #17}. Learning to engage in these kinds of collaborative tasks need a high level of cognitive sophistication {Paavola, 2005 #49} and a designed environment that mirrors the situations in which learners are likely to apply what we are teaching them {Goodyear, 2007 #1888}.

An example of this is an Engineering &quot;virtual internship&quot;, where students spend ten weeks in a problem-based scenario where their goal is to research and design a specific robotics component model {Chesler, 2015 #9140}. As well as using fictional but realistic testing, feedback and assessment processes, the task is further problematized by a divergent set of stakeholder requirements which cannot all be met, creating a complex problem that requires more than Engineering domain knowledge to solve {Chesler, 2015 #9140}. A full discussion about situated and authentic learning and assessment is beyond the scope of this proposal; the example here serves to illustrate the general type of group task that has epistemic and systems aspects. As well as creating a specific model in the sense of a prototype, the learners also participate in the system model of the knowledge building environment of the virtual company, and the processes of making decisions as a socio-cultural-technical process. This combines task authenticity with active engagement in learning how to manage their co-construction of knowledge through the dynamic networks of team member relations, tasks, tools, and the way these interact, necessary for collaboration {Reimann, 2010 #60}. We can also see the role of iterative model submission communicating both domain understanding and decision making, as the problem space and solution become increasingly elaborated and refined.

There is widespread agreement that modelling is not only important for engineers. Banathy and Jenlink (2004) discuss how as an &quot;intellectual technology and mode of enquiry&quot;, systems design can be both explanatory in understanding a problem, and describing a solution. A salient feature of system models is that they can condense a lot of complexity into a relatively small space {Morecroft, 2007 #356}. While models are often &#39;maps&#39; or &#39;microworlds&#39; representing reality, such as where learners build and refine models of physical materials science to improve their use of modelling tools and representations instead of passively engaging with algorithmic representations {Blikstein, 2010 #72}, model construction can also be used to foreground decision making processes. Using model notation to simulate predicted future events can encompass current and future states and the conditions under which they can be achieved, but more importantly, the assumptions the designers have about what is included in the model, the causal relationships, and the outcomes of interaction between elements {Jonassen, 2012 #411} surfacing their different perspectives. These are epistemic as well as systems understandings, involving elaboration of ideas that describe or explain or define different aspects of the system of inquiry. This process is necessary for the group&#39;s individual and shared learning, as they co-construct unambiguous descriptions for concepts that may be ill-defined, for example, drawing on Chesler (2015) above, whether there is agreement about the most important features of a solution. Figure 1 from {Richardson, 2010 #9081} below illustrates how the model acts as a &quot;boundary object&quot;; both a dynamic tool for externalising and discussing diverse perspectives and a representation of the current state of understanding. The &quot;Remembering and Displaying&quot; intersection below shows how, as the model is developed and tested, the constraints of form and notation enable those externalised mental models to be refined through negotiation (the &quot;Facilitation Zone&quot;) into stable and agreed elements and relationships, (The &quot;Modeling Zone&quot;) and a create a shared language for describing not only the content but also the structure of what is represented in the &quot;Current GMB Boundary Object&quot;.

_Figure 1: Boundary objects in system dynamics group model building._

This potential to engage students in the deep cognitive processes of analysis and reasoning {Mulder, 2016 #3047} effecting change to their conceptual frameworks, or &quot;mental models&quot; {Jonassen, 2005 #5280} makes learning by model construction an interesting pedagogical mechanism for disciplines outside its traditional domain of the &quot;hard&quot; systems of science, mathematics and engineering.

## Collaborative modelling for complex problem solving

Outside formal education, collaborative modelling (or group model building [GMB], or group modelling) is well-established as a process to elicit and share mental models {Vennix, 1996 #2389} while solving complex social problems, such as health care {Andersen, 1997 #2372;Richardson, 1995 #7683} and environmental management {Stave, 2002 #2371}. Like our pedagogical objective, the goal of GMB is to &quot;help individual participants gain more insight into the structure and behaviour of a system&quot;, although the evidence around this is unclear and needs further research {Andersen, 1997 #2370@188-190}. A secondary goal is a &quot;change of attitude&quot; toward a proposal (p. 191). Group model building also has systemic characteristics, with a high level objective such as social or organisational process change {Vennix, 1999 #9092} interrelated with group goals of mental model alignment, creating agreement and consensus, and generating commitment to a decision {Andersen, 1997 #2370;Vennix, 1996 #2389}. It has been used for problem structuring where there is not even agreement on whether there is a problem {Vennix, 1999 #9092}.

These characteristics could contribute to an effective design approach for groups of learners solving complex problems. Collaborative modelling is consistent with a Learning Sciences viewpoint, as it understands individuals&#39; &quot;mental models&quot; also comprise situatedness, embodiedness, distributedness, contextuality, bounding, and other epistemic dimensions. It is also consistent with constructivism, which understands that learners continually integrate new information in a cognitive manner (and an intentional one, often, in educational contexts) and the individual nature of cognitive knowledge means that individual model constructions are often partial or fragmented {Jonassen, 2005 #5280;Vennix, 1999 #9092}. Model building can overcome these limitations of individual cognitive and perceptive processes {Vennix, 1996 #2389}, and the &quot;multiple realities&quot; {Vennix, 1996 #2389;Vennix, 1999 #9092} which need to be made visible within the system of inquiry in order for the desired change to occur. In Hoppenbrouwers&#39; work, this has been supported by a range of dialogue patterns to structure conversations {Hoppenbrouwers, 2011 #7564}. However, where these interventions have occurred, they have had specific limitations which would be difficult to overcome in a rapidly-moving, under-funded higher education environment.

While collaborative modelling has evolved to take advantage of technological affordances, these studies use a specialist facilitator and/or modeller who does not have domain knowledge and is not a part of the system {Andersen, 1997 #2372;Andersen, 1997 #2370;Vennix, 1996 #2389;Vennix, 1999 #9092;Richardson, 1995 #7683;Richardson, 1995 #7683;Hoppenbrouwers, 2011 #7564;Richardson, 2010 #9081}. Designed workshops are resource-intensive and time-consuming {Andersen, 1997 #2372;Vennix, 1996 #2389;Hoppenbrouwers, 2011 #7564;Richardson, 2010 #9081}, and require a large number of experts to meet face to face at least once {Vennix, 1996 #2389;Andersen, 1997 #2372;Richardson, 2010 #9081;Hoppenbrouwers, 2011 #7564}. Even with this support, there are still concerns about who contributes what to the solution {Vennix, 1996 #2389}. So, while group model building is clearly an effective process for solving complex problems collaboratively, there is space between the current research directions above and our need for students to engage in teamwork without formal facilitation, within time constraints accommodating other studies and work, over the six to ten weeks typically comprising a taught unit&#39;s group component, both synchronously and asynchronously, and usually through a technology layer.

## Evaluating complex problem solving processes and solutions

Although a direct comparison is not made, a recent study by {Damşa, 2016 #9089@@author-year} demonstrates that knowledge objects and models have important features in common. Both can act as a tool to externalise internal concepts as well as a representation of conceptual understanding. Both can be an object of inquiry as well as a scaffold for the inquiry process. Both materialise as a stabilisation of constructed knowledge at a specific point in time. In this research, Damşa &amp; Ludvigsen used a design-based research (DBR) approach and case study methodology to investigate how knowledge objects emerged from collaborative interactions in a teacher education course in the Netherlands {Damşa, 2016 #9089}. The participant groups engaged in complex problem solving generating shared knowledge objects as solutions, mediated by technology. Data comprised interaction data such as recordings of group meetings, documents such as the iterative drafts of knowledge objects and reflection data such as survey. Using a blend of qualitative and quantitative analysis, the study examined the nature of interactions, and the _key moments_ leading to a relevant development on the shared objects. They also analysed _uptake_ of key concepts from session to session, and into the knowledge object (or not). Finally, they rated the degree of _elaboration_ in the knowledge objects. Despite the groups being from the same cohort, they engaged in different interactional and co-construction behaviours, leading to a wide divergence in uptake of shared understandings, complexity of conceptualisations, and elaboration of knowledge objects {Damşa, 2016 #9089}. These findings support previous work which shows higher quality objects are produced by frequent productive interactions that result in associated and time-bound changes to the knowledge object {Damşa, 2014 #1098}, but also that collaborative tasks can be completed successfully without shared learning taking place {Damşa, 2010 #1891}. Over the course of these studies Damşa differentiates between epistemic (idea-driven) and regulative (process-driven) activities, and argues both must occur for shared learning to take place {Damşa, 2014 #1098;Damşa, 2010 #1891;Damşa, 2016 #9089}. Together, this research confirms that empirical investigation of collective strategies about elaboration and knowledge advancement is possible, if complex.

Damşa &amp; Ludvigsen (2016) define _productive interactions_ as &quot;communicative exchanges … leading to participants generating and elaborating ideas and knowledge objects as shared outcomes of collaborative group work&quot; {Damşa, 2016 #9089@3}. They highlight that the most successful group used deliberate strategies to engage with concepts, structure the problem and generate explanations, and, importantly, to transform ideas through &quot;materialising&quot; knowledge in the knowledge object. This involves using the socio-cultural tools of language and representation to externalise the inner world in a way that can then be accessible to others. It may also involve affordances of the learning environment, in Damşa&#39;s study the &quot;Knowledge Practices Environment&quot; (KPE) virtual collaboration layer, comprising collaborative document editing, source collection and linking, chat-based discussion and planning tools. We can see from this study the importance of epistemic actions, idea uptake and elaboration, and object elaboration and complexity, but we can&#39;t see whether specific affordances of the environment are associated with particular actions. For example, there is a planner, but we can&#39;t see whether the groups used this to schedule meetings. We also can&#39;t see if the tools were used as intended, or whether different groups used them differently from each other. This data would be useful in the process of intentionally enabling design of collaborative environments and processes.

The KPE at various stages of implementation also features in a range of studies around &quot;trialogical learning&quot; {Dondi, 2011 #29;Hakkarainen, 2011 #9176;Hakkarainen, 2009 #9182;Paavola, 2009 #9185;Paavola, 2005 #49;Paavola, 2014 #9179}. Like Damşa&#39;s approach, this framework also foregrounds collaborative advancement of knowledge artefacts and practices, specifically technology environments that support learning by productive activities in collaborative design over time {Paavola, 2014 #9179}. Trialogical learning encompasses socio-cultural-historical-activity-artefact-mediated knowledge theories, as well as the concept of external memory fields {Ritella, 2012 #7570;Paavola, 2014 #9179;Hakkarainen, 2011 #9176;Hakkarainen, 2009 #9182} which in turn is consistent with the field of extended cognition proposed by {Clark, 1998 #9190@@author-year;Clark, 2003 #7745@@author-year;Clark, 2017 #9115}, both of which propose that objects in the environment function as part of mind. The focus in these KPE studies is on the processes that participants engage in to collaboratively develop the knowledge artefacts which act as &quot;stepping stones&quot; to extend the boundary of both individual and shared knowledge {Paavola, 2014 #9179}. This is analogous to the {Richardson, 2010 #9081} framework describing the iterative collaborative development process of models as boundary objects at Figure 1 above. However, where Richardson divides complex problem solving into a formal, role-based, expert-assisted process focusing on systems, causality and feedback {Richardson, 2010 #9081}, the trialogical model draws on intense engagement with, and socially-related transformation of, both knowledge practices and relevant technology competences over time toward the objective of the activity. {Damşa, 2016 #9089@@author-year} describe fewer features of the designed environment, and do not explicitly refer to trialogical learning, but in both that study and in {Damşa, 2014 #1098@@author-year} the articulated design principles are consistent with the trialogical approach.

From a design perspective, both the trialogical approach and empirical investigation of idea uptake and elaboration are interesting because our goal is to create learning environments that support collaboration, and we know that learners adapt, or &quot;instrumentalise&quot; {Rabardel, 2003 #9085}, the affordances of environments differently as a socio-cultural process, and that this is particularly complex in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) {Lonchamp, 2012 #7681}. Imagine trying to externalise your mental model of the colour blue and how it relates to the sky to another team member if your computer interface is only monochrome and you are in a room with no windows.

To summarise, while we understand some of the features of group work environments that help learners collaborate successfully, there is not enough data and insight yet for us to confidently design CSCL settings and tasks that reliably develop capacity for new knowledge co-construction. The complex and social nature of learning together is nuanced and unpredictable, with a rapidly expanding body of research focusing on aspects of self-regulation, motivation, metacognition and, particularly, group processes and leadership. Attention to the regulative dimension of group work is essential to successful collaboration, and it is widely recognised that CSCL environments with features such as synchronous and asynchronous communication tools and multimedia representations need additional kinds of affordances for ensuring equal participation, knowledge acquisition and decision making. We think it is likely that group model building has unexplored potential for collaborative learning in higher education because of its relevance for addressing authentic, wicked {Rittel, 1973 #9249}, messy {Ackoff, 1974 #9250} problems, and because of the general importance of models as knowledge objects. While we know the learners appropriate orinstrumentaliseenvironmental features to make them more useful to their work, we know much less about how they might appropriate the knowledge objects and metacognitive artefacts of others.

Our Literature Review showed that students in higher education are cautious about engaging in group work _per se_; with specific concerns about equity and leadership. A poor experience can mean learners are more likely to avoid further collaboration, leading to a lower level of both individual and shared knowledge across epistemic, systems thinking and socio-cultural dimensions. A learning environment that lacks affordances which can be learner-instrumentalised {Lonchamp, 2012 #7681} to support iterative knowledge co-construction will inhibit the externalisation and articulation of mental models and limit the expansion of everyone&#39;s knowledge boundaries. Without scaffolding active epistemic enquiry into multiple perspectives and regulative interactions that develop metacognitive skills, important individual knowledge and information may not be captured and taken up in the collaborative problem solving process. This project explores how an environment designed to support these activities is used by learners, and the ways in which it may impact on their outcomes.

The theoretical framework, design features, observable events and resultant data that will be used to answer the research questions are set out at Table 1. Each conjecture is then explained in more detail in the Methodology.

## The concept of self-organised learning

{Harri-Augstein, 2018 #8087} discusses reading as a &quot;continuing series of predictions about the text&quot; that occur in a pattern of responses to textual cues. While this theoretical approach is not dependent on Repertory Grid, it is strongly aligned with Personal Construct Theory&#39;s &quot;man as scientist&quot; foundations. Kelly refused to separate &quot;learning&quot; from other areas of human life, believing the feedback from predictions constituted a continuous &quot;learning&quot; experience (Kelly, 1955, find pp). {Thomas, 1985 #1145}{Harri-Augstein, 2018 #8087} {Candy, 1985 #8088} _conversational_ model of learning is consistent with theory across the Learning Sciences, with personal reflection taking on an important role in internal process analysis {Candy, 1985 #8088}. One of the strategies used to help learners structure their knowledge is the &quot;Structure of Meaning&quot; technique {Candy, 1985 #8088}(p110), essentially a personal mind map. This technique is considered particularly suited to listening skills, because while speech is linear, the process of making meaning is more complex {Candy, 1985 #8088}. However, understanding the process of generating meaning structures and their relationship to each other within and across individuals and groups is highly valued outside that context, and particularly where there is the opportunity to create instant feedback, such as in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment.

Our objective is to contribute to the CSCL research base in the areas of knowledge advancement and regulation of learning, specifically, socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL). This design-based research will examine the way learners take up and modify features of a designed collaborative environment to create group regulation and epistemic knowledge objects such as tools and models, when they know that a secondary purpose of that knowledge object creation is its reciprocated provision to a different group as an articulation of their metacognitive and socially shared regulation of learning. It will look at data about learner interactions, environment use and modification, artefacts and knowledge objects, and whether there are identifiable relationships between them.

Our research questions are:

1. How do groups create and develop knowledge objects for (a) modelling and (b) group regulation purposes?
  1. How do groups appropriate designer-provided notations, tools, roles and workflows? (First level appropriation)?
2. How does the expectation to have to communicate insights and practices regarding (a) and (b) to another group—the &quot;target&quot; group—affect knowledge building of the &quot;source&quot; group&#39;? (&quot;Production effect&quot;)?
3. How does the information on (a) and (b) made available from another group—the source group—affect the target group? (&quot;Variation effect&quot;)
  1. How do groups appropriate tools and workflows provided by another group? (Second level appropriation)
