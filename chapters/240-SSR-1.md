# Repertory Grid Technique in Higher Education Collaboration contexts – a systematic scoping review

## Background

The Repertory Grid Technique (RGT, or RepGrid) has endured over more than sixty years as a structurally neutral, language-agnostic survey method whose fundamental premise is to use not the interviewer&#39;s frames and content, but those of the participant. Developed by psychologist George Kelly {Kelly, 1955 #11;Kelly, 1955 #12} as a sense-making tool for clients in therapy, comprehensive reviews have documented its move from a clinical diagnostic tool to address broader research areas in organisational {Neimeyer, 1990 #

bibliometric review found that while of 973 works found psychology was still a dominant domain, 203 were in other disciplines (in order of frequency): health, computer science, marketing, business administration, engineering, tourism, art, environment, economics, agriculture, education, politics, social work, religion, aeronautics, library science and sports{Saul, 2012 #470}[Table 5 page 123]. Of those, only three were classified as &quot;education&quot;.

More recently, we have seen increasing precedents for its use in education. {Aditomo, 2011 #8037} used the technique to connect perceptions about learning activities to writing performance, and concluded RGT &quot;both useful and practically viable&quot;, revealing both whether and how high and low performing participants construed their collaborative writing task, and the specific combinations of elements and constructs that students prefer (&quot;Discussion and conclusions&quot;

section). In the NEXT-TELL project, {Vatrapu, 2012 #8039} developed an online RGT tool that allowed teachers to monitor learners&#39; knowledge structures in real time, seeing what concepts they thought of as similar and dissimilar. These studies are exemplary in that they (a) do not assume the researcher already knows how the respondent frames their experience and (b) use analysis to connect the responses with other empirical data – in Aditomo et al. writing marks and in Vatrapu et al. benchmarked concept models – to create a mixed-method student-centric approach to understanding how learners understand the domain of inquiry. Both synchronous and asynchronous use of RGT are feasible and useful for eliciting, sharing and elaborating on mental models in an educational context. However, it is difficult to locate studies with this focus, as the available research extends across multiple domains and literature formats. The initial aim of this scoping review was to sketch the landscape of Repertory Grid Technique across higher education, as both pedagogic and research method, in order to create a baseline from which further useful inquiry might proceed about its benefits and limitations. However, the configuration of results requires a more detailed explanation, and, ultimately, a narrower focus for my conclusions.

## Method

Scoping reviews are a relatively new methodology {Peters, 2015 #6} that respond to the need for evidence-based practice {Arksey, 2005 #1;Peters, 2015 #6} in areas that are not a good fit for true systematic review because evidence is still emerging {Peters, 2015 #6}, the literature is complex, or which cross disciplinary boundaries {Kastner, 2012 #4;Peters, 2015 #6}. Whereas a full systematic review has a narrowly defined research question and synthesises both evidence and knowledge resulting from an exhaustive search {Arksey, 2005 #1;Peters, 2015 #6}, a scoping review looks at the range of available evidence {Arksey, 2005 #1} to &#39;map&#39; the phenomenon of inquiry.{Arksey, 2005 #1;Gough, 2012 #3;Peters, 2015 #6} then summarise and disseminate the findings {Arksey, 2005 #1;Peters, 2015 #6}. While this might appear a less rigorous method, the requirements for replicability {Arksey, 2005 #1;Peters, 2015 #6}, and transparency around criteria used for search, inclusion and exclusion {Arksey, 2005 #1;Gough, 2012 #3;Kastner, 2012 #4;Peters, 2015 #6} are the same. This review will follow the methodological framework set out by {Arksey, 2005 #1} for scoping studies, the structure recommended by {Peters, 2015 #6}, the _meta-interpretation_ knowledge synthesis approach described by {Gough, 2012 #3} [Table 1, p3] to provide the best possible account of the accessible literature, and its &quot;nature, features and volume&quot; {Peters, 2015 #6} [p141]. As a single researcher, my principal aim is to provide a navigation mechanism through this body of work, enabling wider and deeper investigation of the multiple nodes of research that emerge.

### Methodological framework

The methodological framework will follow {Arksey, 2005 #1}

1. identifying the research question
2. identifying relevant studies
3. study selection
4. charting the data
5. collating, summarising and reporting the results {Arksey, 2005 #1} [p22]

#### 1. Identifying the research question

My initial research question is specifically directed to my research in higher education group work but very broad, as the literature is largely unknown and not confined to a specific discipline:

- How is the Repertory Grid Technique used as a pedagogic method in higher education?

The objective of the review is to identify studies where RepGrid is used to measure change in a university context. This is likely to be in repeated-measures designs, but in order to be as inclusive as possible, exclusion will not occur on the basis of study design at this stage.

#### 2. Identifying relevant studies

Developing an initial protocol is a critical step in the systematic review process.

{Arksey, 2005 #1} suggest beginning by considering which aspects of the question are most important to develop a search strategy. &quot;Repertory Grid Technique&quot; is the most important feature because of my particular interest in its potential, and the term is procedurally and conceptually specific. This review takes as an epistemological stance Kelly&#39;s _constructive alternativism_: people are agentic and can re-create themselves if they have the &quot;courage and imagination&quot; to do so {Fransella, 2005 #2955} [p23]. Based in Personal Construct Theory (PCT) and Personal Construct Psychology (PCP) {Kelly, 1955 #11;Kelly, 1955 #12}, the Repertory Grid Technique is inherently constructivist. However, as the focus of the review is not on the psychological merits of RepGrid, I need to develop a protocol which will balance a realistic review scope not including RepGrid&#39;s clinical use with the likely situation of RepGrid studies across the social sciences domain.

The second most important aspect, &quot;Higher Education&quot;, is also difficult to confine to a single search domain. As well as books and journal articles, researchers in higher education often use conference papers and proceedings to disseminate their work, and that work might be described in the pedagogic content domain – for example, a study conducted in a first year engineering unit – rather than the education discipline. Another challenge is that relevant studies might use other terms such as &quot;undergraduate&quot;, &quot;postgraduate&quot;, or &quot;college&quot; to describe the context, and even this might not be specified in accessible search fields, requiring closer reading to establish. There is again the balance of volume and relevance, with the aim of capturing as much useful data as possible in a viable time frame.

{Arksey, 2005 #1}{Peters, 2015 #6} and {Gough, 2012 #3} all describe the need for a flexible and iterative approach to scoping studies. In this review, I will use a combination of technical and manual methods, and a sequence of loose and tighter constraints to gradually refine the body of work that is relevant to the research questions. My initial understanding of Repertory Grid Technique is through the world of Mildred Shaw and Brian Gaines at the University of Calgary. As a first step, I will review all their work on the topics, including Mildred&#39;s doctoral thesis. search the full breadth of accessible databases, books and theses available to me as a research student at the University of Sydney. This search scope was developed in consultation with specialist Faculty Librarian during protocol formulation and is below in Figure 1: Search domains represented as the universe of discourse.

Figure 1: Search domains represented as the universe of discourse.

Before I finalised my research question, I checked for registration of systematic reviews at Joanna Briggs Institute {The Joanna Briggs Institute, 2020 #8035}at 1138 on Saturday 28 September 2019 using the search term &quot;repertory&quot;, and no titles were returned. I also checked PROSPERO {National Institute for Health Research, 2019 #8036} at 1140 on the same day, identifying three registrations of systematic review in progress. Related to HIV prevention {Brown, #8038}, psychosis {García-Mieres, #8037} and depressive symptoms {Walz, #8039}, they are outside the scope of this review.

Careful consideration also needs to be given to the search terms, as at this point the selection will determine inclusion and exclusion at a high level {Alexander, 2020 #10}. While I have established the key terms &quot;repertory grid technique&quot; and &quot;higher education&quot;, the former might be described differently, for example, &quot;RepGrid&quot;, and &quot;higher&quot; might exclude studies in a higher education context that are not specifically described. However, &quot;education&quot; is a very broad field ranging from 0-5 childhood right through to professional education and community music classes. Both terms also potentially limit results to works in English, creating an Anglo-centric bias. {Gough, 2012 #3} proposes that in _aggregating_ reviews whose purpose is to establish the volume and scope of work, the established protocol can incorporate quality assurance through inclusion criteria, then subsequently be reviewed in light of what is found. This needs several iterations of the {Peters, 2015 #6} three-step method of database search, textual analysis and reference list search, with the aim of reaching saturation, where no new studies are forthcoming {Alexander, 2020 #10}.

Determining the date range of the search was a difficult balance, given that RepGrid was developed more than 60 years ago. While restricting the date range would have made the collection, coding and analysis much easier, there are important reasons not to. In the early days of the technique, as well as in the early days of computer-aided analysis of grid responses, digitisation of documents was rare. My purpose in this study was to foreground the work that has been done in the field which may not be easily accessible in a digital form, and to capture useful tools and methods which may have been only narrowly disseminated before the aggregation that the internet has made possible. This had an impact on the number of search results returned, and made less thorough analysis possible in the available timeframe. However, as this scoping review is designed to provide a platform for further research, I decided to make it as extensive as possible, sacrificing depth for breadth to some extent. I fully acknowledge this limitation, and propose as compensation a rigorous and transparent method whose artefacts are available for others to build on.

The first stage of search was intended to be broad enough to find studies that did not always use the full terminology &quot;repertory grid technique&quot;, but defined enough so studies referring to tools like &quot;WebGrid&quot; were included only when it was the RepGrid WebGrid application and not the software development tool, excluding reactive gas technique &quot;RGT&quot;, or reactive gas software timing &quot;RGT&quot;. While I acknowledge there is an English-language bias, it is likely that works even in other languages will refer to the foundational works whose titles include &quot;Repertory Grid Technique&quot;, and no specific language parameters were set in the database searches. As these subject databases accessed are focused more on Randomised Control Trials, additional searches across grey literature are also relevant including a substantial body of work from the authors of the RepGrid WebGrid software (Shaw and Gaines, 2018. A summary of database search sequence, parameters and records returned for Search Stage 1 is at Table 1.

I created a specific EndNote library for each search set of documents, attaching full-text to each bibliographic record where available. This ensured that as iterative refinement of protocol appropriate to scoping reviews {Peters, 2015 #5} occurred, the previous document sets could be re-examined in this light. This proved to be important, as the discoveries that occurred next meant the second phase of searching was not done in the same order. As the scoping review method&#39;s focus is on rigour and transparency, more details about the Search Stage 1 procedures are set out in detail below.

#### 3. Study selection

Study selection will take place over two stages in order to accommodate the broad spread of data and variation in reporting format.

- Search Stage 1 will identify studies that are situated in higher education contexts.
- Search Stage 2 will identify from that subset of studies those where the Repertory Grid Technique has been used not only as a single measurement, but a deliberate pedagogical strategy.

#### 4. Charting the data

The aim of this study is to aggregate the reports of studies that use RepGrid as a pedagogical tool in higher education. However, in order to develop the state of knowledge on the process to a level from which further research is more informed, I am also providing the dataset at each stage of each search process. This includes:

- --original database output from Search Stage 1
- --document information for all studies reviewed at Search Stage 1
- --document classification (higher education with full-text, higher education needing full-text, a full-text needed to see if higher education setting) for all studies reviewed at Search Stage 1
- --[finalise]

## Search Procedure Stage 1

### &quot;On becoming a personal scientist: interactive computer programs for developing personal models of the world&quot;

To create a sense of internal narrative, I began by reviewing the first document related to Repertory Grid Technique in Education, Mildred G. Shaw&#39;s thesis &quot;On becoming a personal scientist: interactive computer programs for developing personal models of the world&quot; {Shaw, 1978 #8413}. While {Shaw, 1978 #8413} did not develop the Repertory Grid Technique, her work on both the process of eliciting the grid and analysis using (then) emerging computer technology is fundamental to the way it is used today. Shaw recognised the tensions inherent in the need for educational contexts to connect personally meaningful concepts with established traditions and &#39;facts&#39; (emphasis in original) {Shaw, 1978 #8413} [p4]. In the same way she recognised &quot;education must prepare the learner for a world where knowledge is changing, where flexibility and adaptability are the hall-marks of success&quot; {Shaw, 1978 #8413} [p5].

While {Shaw, 1978 #8413} focused on conversations between theoretical facets of individuals, she recognised at a higher level that to be effective as a feedback mechanism, the representation of grid data should be understandable to the participant (or &#39;elicitee&#39;), bringing their own tacit frames into view in a meaningful way. Her subsequent analysis of the limitations of both existing psychological scales and the way in which grid data was represented led her to pursue the generation of valid statistical interpretation of results. First, she identified that factor analysis, principal component analysis, multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis tempted researchers to impose their own structure on the elicitation and interpretation process. She found cluster analysis, when the clustering was done by the participant, both &quot;sensitive&quot; and &quot;empathic&quot; {Shaw, 1978 #8413}[p51].

This became the foundation of an algorithm which was designed to make the process outcomes visible to the participant as well as the interviewer. To simplify interpretation, grid representation had only a matrix of scores and two trees of clusters, making it clear that it is a very direct arrangement of raw responses, with little computer processing in the middle. The rows and columns are sorted by similarity of score, and that is elaborated on with lines showing the extent of the similarity. Representation of grid data is discussed further in Chapter n.

While the principal statistical and technical infrastructure around the computerised implementation of RGT was developed by Mildred G. Shaw, as she and her colleague at the University of Calgary&#39;s Software Engineering Research Network (SERN) {University of Calgary, 1996 #8441} Brian Gaines wrote so much together and cited each other frequently, it was important to go through all their joint and individual publications rather than just hers. Where there were discrepancies in publication titles, years or provenance between my record and the citation at [http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/reports/](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/reports/), the information available in the document itself was used.

### Developing the search

#### Epistemonikos [a database focused on health and clinical psychology] as a starting point

As the body of work from Shaw and Gaines was substantial, I elected to test my coding with a small document set until my workflow was established. I selected the Epistemonikos output as it had a small number of files but more than one. In EndNote (EndNote X9.3.2. Build 19235 for Mac), I checked all abstracts were in place and attached full-text where available. I renamed all attachments to author-date-title format as this is the document title that will display in the MAXQDA2020 (MAXQDA Analytics Pro 2020 Release 20.0.6) statistical analysis software. Consistency is always helpful, and with the understanding that the next import will bring a substantial number of documents in with identical authors and years it is necessary to tell one from another easily. After saving these as a new EndNote Library and exporting the file data as .RIS, I opened MAXQDA2020 and used the EndNote import function to select the .RIS, then the .ENL, to import both the &quot;References&quot; and &quot;References \&gt; ATTACHMENTS&quot;, which I retitled &quot;Epistemonikos&quot; and &quot;Epistemonikos \&gt; ATTACHMENTS&quot;.

From a surface perspective, all the article titles are about people in some kind of therapeutic engagement, which I categorized as &quot;clinical&quot;. I then reviewed each article text further in MAXQDA2020 to see which terms I should exclude from the next phase of search strategy. At the same time, I had the opportunity to contribute to my broader Literature Review by using this sample data set to also find terms to exclude from data analysis. As the two sets of terms were likely to be substantially similar, I chose a data-driven approach to identifying terms within this set of records which could be useful to limit results in future searches and provide cleaner data for analysis.

I first created individual word clouds and word frequency tables for each document in the Epistemonikos project to identify terms were not relevant to this review. To reduce clutter in textual analysis, it is customary to use a list of &quot;stop&quot; words not relevant to the researchers analytical frame. MAXQDA2020 offers one set of pre-configured stop list words in English, principally &quot;definite and indefinite articles, conjunctions, or numerals&quot;. {VERBI Software, 2019 #7616}. Even though these lists had been uploaded, the clouds and tables showed that several variations were still included. To remedy this, I used the application&#39;s interface to manually add words already established as stop words (for example, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot; and &quot;did&quot;) to the stop list. This is appropriate to use for my review but is not adequate to exclude the range of clinical or therapeutic contexts which are not relevant to higher education learning, teaching and research, particularly for databases with large psychologically-situated output sets such as PsycINFO. Once I had uploaded the additional stop word list to MAXQDA2020, I re-ran the word frequency analysis to check that the result foregrounded more relevant terms, such as &quot;self&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, and &quot;cognitive&quot;. While these terms may be found in a clinical context, they are also potentially relevant to educational research and could not be excluded at this stage of the review. Full documentation of this process is at \&lt; /Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/tables for documentation/stoplist-analysis.xlsx\&gt;.

My next step was to work through the frequency table line by line, and develop a custom stop list based on my research aim – to provide a benchmark of how RepGrid has been operationalised in higher education as a pedagogic strategy. By the 100th row of the frequency output, variations on the previous terms were frequent and I concluded it was likely I had reached saturation of these terms, at least for this data set. After reviewing these 100 terms, I then broke them down into categories, and determined those that may be too relevant to exclude. The data from this is at Table N. \&lt;/Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/tables for documentation/inclusion-exclusion-argument.xlsx\&gt;. These were broken down into thematic groups to allow maximum flexibility in searching. The current set of stop lists is at [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c17n3w17be32tsn/AACtCqpK-0JBpz4yomBFzkSla?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c17n3w17be32tsn/AACtCqpK-0JBpz4yomBFzkSla?dl=0).

The next step was to search for anything in the document set that was relevant to my research aim to set search parameters. The stop word lists are not interoperable with the Lexical Search function in MAXQDA2020, so I used the list to develop a search strategy for exclusion, while including the terms &quot;educ\*&quot;, and &quot;repgrid&quot; or &quot;repertory&quot; or &quot;grid&quot;. After running the next (Cochrane Library) search the parameters were later slightly modified, as &quot;counselling&quot; is a frequent term in health and medicine, and &quot;grid&quot; in software development. These lexical search parameters are at Table 2

After running the search, I then reviewed the displayed results, which include the full sentence in which the term is found.

#### Cochrane Library [A database focused on systematic reviews]

As the Cochrane Library search only returned 17 references they were manually checked. None of these results were in the scope of this review. However, this stage highlighted the need to add variations of &quot;counselling&quot; to the search strategy exclusions. \&lt;/Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/tables for documentation/lex-1.xlsx\&gt; [should I keep adding the changing parameters or just describe them in narrative and add to Appendix?].

### Record searching

With the initial approach bedded down, I commenced the database searches in the order recommended by the Faculty Librarian. An important consideration for these larger datasets is the absence of an associated full-text. While EndNote has a feature to access full-text from the university Library, system issues prevented this from being usable. I address this in this review by:

1. If an abstract is available, search the abstract,
2. If an abstract is not available, exclude the document only if the title includes a word in the exclusion list,
3. If not excluded, locate and manually download a full text version for review and coding.

All lexical searches were conducted across both RIS and full-text versions where available as the type and amount of data vary considerably across databases, with the exception of ProQuest Central, PsycINFO and Scopus (7630 records in total), where the terms were searched in title and abstract only.

A summary of the results appears at Table 3: Classification of search results from Stage 1. More detail about the specific approach to and challenges around each search locus follows.

#### A+ Education

The APlus database focuses on education research in Australian settings {Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER), 2020 #8507}, and was a useful opportunity to begin a more nuanced coding regime around learning and teaching in an important source of potentially relevant studies. As the number of studies was relatively small, they were manually reviewed for inclusion.

Returning to my defined scope of RepGrid in Higher Education, I narrowed my search strategy slightly with the aim of reducing irrelevant results: educa\* (avoiding &quot;reduc\*&quot;) AND &quot;repgrid&quot; OR &quot;repertory grid&quot; BUT NOT words in the clinical stop list OR child OR children. I also removed &quot;grid&quot; as a standalone search term as it is common across multiple other domains. \&lt;/Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/tables for documentation/lex-2.xlsx\&gt;

From the initial 76 documents found in the database search, my lexical search returned 55 documents containing the search terms. A manual review of these 55 documents showed that my coding should specify the setting (for example, school education versus higher education) and information about the epistemic or pedagogical activities it was used for (for example, team decision-making and conceptual mapping). Where the focus was at a more abstracted level (for example, interdisciplinarity or intercultural facilitation), that was coded on a case-by-case basis.

Figure 2: Example of coding a document that meets the initial inclusion criteria shows an example of coding applied from the Setting, Research and Something Else categories. This document does meet the criteria for inclusion in the review. \&lt;/Volumes/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Analysis Files/code-assignment-example-APlus.png\&gt;

Figure 2: Example of coding a document that meets the initial inclusion criteria.

I then reviewed the 21 documents not found in the Lexical search, and found two records that met the criteria for inclusion but did have the term &quot;child/ren&quot;. This exclusion had the unintended effect of excluding teacher education in higher education where this term was mentioned in the title or abstract. While it is manageable to manually check this small number of documents for inclusion, the search strategy for PsycINFO will need to include these terms and then be coded depending on whether it is ALSO a Higher Education or professional development, stakeholder or other setting. \&lt;/Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/tables for documentation/lex-3.xlsx\&gt; In total, 16 studies were in Higher Ed with full-text, 12 needing full-text and 14 needing full-text to establish whether they are in HE. The A+ ENL is available at <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/49vdj2nzmvxtp3m/AABxgOSLt4lld_-PLwm2SVJ4a?dl=0>.

### Reconfiguration

While I reviewed the RepPlus papers from Shaw and Gaines prior to re-reviewing the database outputs above, I reviewed them again after the minor changes to search strategy made above. While with the A+ output all I had was abstracts, and some records lacked those, I have all the full papers from RepPlus. This allowed searching the full-text rather than the abstracts to more closely target relevant studies. I removed the terms &quot;child&quot; and &quot;children&quot; from the exclusion list with the aim of then searching that term and manually assigning a code. During the test stages of my initial search, I noted that several documents in this set may not use the term &quot;repertory grid&quot;, but may use either the platform title &quot;webgrid&quot;, or the title of one of the components, such as &quot;PEGASUS&quot;, &quot;FOCUS&quot;, or &quot;SOCIOGRIDS&quot;. Also checked which excluded terms impacted the finding of relevant documents: patient\* (11 records); medic\* (2 records); clinic\* (2). On closer review, those records tend to be large works which provide deep background to Repertory Grid Technique, which began in a therapeutic context. I decided to retain those words in the exclusion list and manually check for them in the unidentified record set. \&lt;/Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/tables for documentation/lex-4.xlsx\&gt;. After running this search in the RepPlus document set, it returned 46 documents from the 196. Of those 46, 13 meet the criteria for this study. Of the six results that met the criteria for the first search but not the second, only one met the criteria, and that document was already coded as HE from the full-text version. This accuracy was sufficient for me to proceed with searching the other database results. There are two versions of one paper which are substantially similar; both have been included in the ENL at <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l7sm7l57yrwmuq7/AABHNExfvmqH8YwNy0ci75SXa?dl=0>.

#### ERIC

ERIC is also a specialist education theory and practice database, referencing both journal articles and unpublished documents and research on education policy and practice in development contexts {Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education, 2020 #8506}. Of the 205 database search results, fourteen were duplicates, leaving 191, all of which were found in the lexical search [search params 4]. The high number of results was to be expected, given the pedagogical focus of the database. Fifty three of those are HE studies with full text, eight HE needing full-text, and four need full-text to establish whether they are HE. ENL is at <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kgfsl0p5me5h9ke/AABKWAXU539FyAkUqH_umtrKa?dl=0>.

#### JSTOR

JSTOR contains full-text of major academic journals and scholarly literature from around the world, with limited coverage for the preceding five years {Ithaka, 2020 #8508}. Unfortunately, only 10% of JSTOR articles have abstracts, so the full text search was important, even though it returned 266 different works. Of those 266, 85 have no abstract. Full text was located for all 85 documents, with 71 subsequently found by lexical search. Of these only nine were in an HE setting and already have full text (because above), one study needs full-text for further information, with ENL at  <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9dvsk06qfq5oxpb/AADpyEkGUfgR4Htrvg_WLFPoa?dl=0>.

#### Web of Science (WOK)

The Web of Knowledge portal hosts _Web of Science, Current Contents Connect, BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE_, and via the Additional Resources tab, _Journal Citation Reports_. Its CrossSearch feature enables a &quot;quick overview&quot; search of these databases and also searches _Agricola_ and _Pubmed_ {Clarivate, 2020 #8509}. While it does allow refinement by category, as there are only 165 papers returned from the search of 71,985,608 I will manually check those as there are only 1 or two in each category so it would take me more time to individually select up to 153 checkboxes.  [image WoK-analysis-1-noabstracts.png versus categories]. Of those 165, 60 had no abstract. As locating full-text versions had proved to be extremely time-consuming, for this dataset I did it differently. I manually reviewed the titles (or the full-text if available) of those without an abstract and on this basis, excluded two relating to parenting, five to therapy, nine to clinical contexts, 11 book reviews, and two about adult education, a total of 29. At the same time, if it was likely the study was in HE or I didn't know, I located the full-text where possible. I then ran the lexical search on both the RIS and the full-text, returning 36 results. In only one case were both RIS and full-text both coded, showing that a surface review of these documents is not always sufficient for certainty. Of the 36 found, six are HE with full text, 2 without full-text and 6 needing full-text to establish context. ENL <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3a2nsjcnmk4qguk/AABnmJt-XKILfT84JjqkmtWaa?dl=0>.

#### PROSPERO

PROSPERO includes protocol details for systematic reviews relevant to health and social care, welfare, public health, education, crime, justice, and international development, where there is a health related outcome {York, 2020 #8511}. The two documents found in this database search are from clinical settings, EN accessible at <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/90sxzntaxsurgkg/AADzrzesjf4ZYk0qIAVnRw8ha?dl=0>

#### PsycINFO

PsycINFO provides access to international literature in psychology and related disciplines, including psychiatry, social sciences, business, health &amp; medicine, law, and linguistics {ProQuest, 2020 #8510}. This database returned a high number of results for the initial search parameters, which is expected because of Repertory Grid Technique&#39;s origin in Personal Construct Psychology. There are a range of filter options but neither the basic (for example, peer reviewed versus all journals) or the advanced (for example, empirical study versus longitudinal, field or focus group study) were suited to my search strategy. To reduce the results to the most relevant studies, the search was repeated restricting the &quot;repertory grid&quot; term to either title or abstract, to exclude studies where it is used as background or in the bibliography. The second search still returned over 900 results (of which more than 80 were theses) so to further refine the data I used the lexical search in MAXQDA first, across both the RIS output from EndNote and those full-texts already accessed. Of the 198 records found, 32 were PDF full text of RIS documents found in the search, and one record had the same full-text added twice, and there was one duplicate reducing the number to review to 156 RIS plus nine PDFs. I then reviewed the titles and abstracts (after downloading those not supplied) of these remaining documents and excluded out of scope papers before locating full-text. Of these 165, 11 were coded as requiring full-text to establish context, 20 as full-text needed for studies in HE and 43 appear to be studies in HE with full-text.

<!-- As the set of documents found by the lex search was lost when the MAX file corrupted, I repeated the search and the working documents are in the old TB versions folder-->


<!-- please please be a good file proquest!!! -->
#### ProQuest Central

ProQuest Central is a major full-text database covering humanities, social sciences, education, health and medical, science and technology and business and management {Proquest LLC, 2020 #8512}. This database returned a high number of results for the initial search parameters, which is expected because of Repertory Grid Technique&#39;s origin in the social sciences and use across educational, health and business settings.  A high proportion (at least 138 on initial review) of these results were in theses, so I refined the search to search only the title and abstract, because I wanted studies in which the technique was foregrounded as they would be the most useful. Of the 603 found in the initial search, seven were duplicates, leaving 596, of which 17 had no abstract. I repeated the exclusion based on title and abstract where it was sufficient and located full-text where possible, finding six with

With these large datasets, there is an increased risk of missing documents because of search parameters that over-limit the results to balance the work that manual review would have located. As the current, previous and next datasets are in the hundreds or thousands of records this is a good time to check the efficiency of this strategy. Once the lexical search had found 188 documents, I manually reviewed the remaining 408 records in the ProQuest dataset. I found only one, _Impacts of integrating the repertory grid into an augmented reality-based learning design on students&#39; learning achievements, cognitive load and degree of satisfaction_,{Wu, 2018 #810} that had not been identified. This shows that manual review of unfound papers at the last stage of the review process should be conducted where possible. To identify why it wasn&#39;t found, I went back to the original EndNote library and did a text search of all results for &quot;Title OR Abstract contains "student". I then searched the 78 records, and found 16 are in HE with an additional 15 in HE research contexts,  but did not use the term &quot;educ\*&quot;, instead "nursing course" and "nursing school", "analysis course", "medical training" and "medical school", and two "undergraduate". The term "university" is also problematic in a lexical search as it does not distinguish between the author's statement of affiliation and the study context. While if all these are relevant to the final output and all are missed by other searches, I lose around 4% of potentially relevant documents at this stage, the alternative is to review more than twice as many records. This is a reluctant compromise but consistent with the limitations of search strategies in systematic reviews in relation to the number and scope of search terms, of which "business school" above is an example, and search field descriptors, for example, searching title but not abstract {José Antonio, 2019 #8128}.

**should I pull all this out into a table? condense narrative? move to Appendix? WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL-
On comparing those 73 records with my coding based on lexical searches,
(a) all records captured by the EndNote review as in higher education had been found by the original search.
(a) I had coded three as HE without also coding FTR {Guo, 2012 #7257}, {Stein, 2003 #511} and {Wolffram, 2009 #580}.
(a) two records I had flagged as HE FTR {, 2001 #7471},{Diamond, 1989 #7580} were not picked up by the QA search.
(a) I had already excluded two of the fourteen records identified as needing full-text to establish context that I had not identified; which, again, may be present in other search results </Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Documents/0_Chapters/250_SSR/PQ-compare-my-result-with-QA.xlsx - should I add this to Appendix?>.**

In total, 37 coded as higher education with full-text, two higher education needing full-text, and 15 needing full-text for context (three found by me and 12 by the QA search), with ENL at <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8a55g315bf49aac/AAAVHjyHC2I4u4iYMJ2GV_Tha?dl=0>.

*check against other results later*

While my approach is consistent with José Antonio et al. recommendations to involve library and information professionals in the co-development of the review strategy (2019), the distribution of data across disciplinary boundaries means it is likely that not all morphological variations of terms in each discipline will be included, meaning some records will not be found. This limitation will in some ways be offset by providing the full dataset and search sequence so that other researchers with more targeted literature needs can include more focused research terms specific to both the discipline and database conventions.  

Another issue with large datasets is with file size and stability, which change in inverse proportion. I am managing this balance by dealing with each database as a separate dataset until Stage 1 is finished. This does have its own limitations, for example, the PsycINFO analysis file crashed repeatedly, and a change in the MAXQDA2020 software mean that the search had to be repeated but the way in which records were accessed and linked was different, which meant I could not salvage the original coding. This is something which is representative of the ongoing change we find in our teaching and research environments and which must be able to be acknowledged and managed transparently. The choice I had made in keeping PDFs within the EndNote system rather than within the MAXQDA2020 project meant that I retained the dataset and attachments despite this issue. While I didn't explicitly address this risk in my project plan, I did make sure than whereever possible a single source of data in a single location is maintained for each record and used the simplest file format possible.

It is also likely that as different databases contain different metadata, these records will have been found by other database searches.

#### Scopus

Scopus is a large multidisciplinary database covering published material in the humanities and sciences {Elsevier B. V., 2020 #8513}. This database returned a high number of results for the initial search parameters, which is expected because of Repertory Grid Technique&#39;s origin in the social sciences and use across educational, health and business settings. I then refined the search parameters to include only social sciences, psychology, arts, decision sciences, neuroscience, multidisciplinary and undefined as shown at Table 4 (higher education/education is not available as a filter). This returned 1946 results.

 Of the 1946 documents, five were duplicates, leaving 1941. Running the lexical search (lex-search-4) across RIS only returned 1031 results and both RIS and full-text returned 1404 results, too large a dataset for the software to code without crashing. ( think this is actually a corrupt PDF) and too large for the scope of this review. I created a word cloud

 ![Screen Shot 2020-09-13 at 12.27.03 pm](/assets/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-13%20at%2012.27.03%20pm_7gis4699o.png)

 from the title text contained in the RIS documents to see how I could exclude less relevant studies at scale. I then refined the word cloud to ignore less relevant words by creating an extra stoplist (https://www.dropbox.com/s/gpv86og7bsv8jb4/stopwords-to-refine-word-cloud-scopus.txt?dl=0). I added words containing between one and three and between 19-56 letters to the stoplist![Word Cloud lex-search-4-RIS-scopus-2](/assets/Word%20Cloud%20lex-search-4-RIS-scopus-2.png). When I re-created the cloud, I could see that clinical and psychotherapy studies were represented more than necessary for my research purposes. I created a new lex-search-5 which used wildcard partials to rule out a range of therapeutic contexts <Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/tables for documentation/lex-searches.xlsx>. Using this search on RIS fields only returned 1029 documents; of these, 176 lacked abstracts so I downloaded full-texts of those where possible. Reviewing these documents found 98 set in Higher Education with full-text, 83 Higher Ed needing full-text, and 69 needing full-text to establish context.  
(I will need to set groups up in Scopuss EN later - I have to merge two ENLS and it will take some time.).


#### Trip

Trip is a clinical search engine designed to allow users to quickly and easily find and use high-quality research evidence to support their practice and/or care, searching across content types including images, videos, patient information leaflets, educational courses and news {Trip Database Ltd., 2020 #8505}. As only 33 results were returned I hand-searched them for relevance, finding only one in a higher education context, for which I have full-text. ENL at <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/36kzfw9fnf3i19r/AAAgN88WHr_DpTRQ6SkiaaHta?dl=0>.

#### Libraries Australia / Trove

Libraries Australia is a resource sharing service managed by the National Library of Australia for Australian libraries and their users. It provides data underpinning the [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) discovery service. Trove contains digital reproductions of newspapers, journals, books, maps, personal papers, as well as archived websites and other born-digital content. It also brings together records and digitised content from libraries, museums, galleries, universities, archives, data repositories and other research and collecting organisations around Australia {National Library of Australia, 2020 #8471}.

I used a similar strategy on the Trove search platform to locate books which might feature RGT in a higher education setting. Search parameters were &quot;Title&quot; all the words &quot;repertory grid&quot;, &quot;Keyword&quot; all the words &quot;repertory grid&quot;. 59 results containing 3 duplicates, a report about which no other information is accessible (&quot;1978, English, Article, Report edition: Repertory grid manual / Marie Walton, Pat Wilson, Harry Pickett. Walton, Marie.&quot;) and two references to videos about using it in performance appraisal which appear to be duplicates and also inaccessible (&quot;1988-1990, English, Video edition: Repertory grid in performance appraisal [videorecording].&quot; and &quot;1980-1990, English, Video edition: Repertory grid in performance appraisal [videorecording].&quot;.

No book had an abstract, so initial exclusion was done on the basis of title alone. Three documents were duplicates, 2 documents were in a higher education context for which I have full-text, and 12 documents potentially meet the criteria, but require full-text to be certain. Unfortunately, of these, at least six are theses and may not be readily available. <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/utu7qylv4as7npr/AAB_VTG3hepvGzUaxSSup8Lqa?dl=0>.

#### YouTube

A search of YouTube for &quot;repertory grid&quot; (without quotes) returned only 37 results, with no duplicates. While videos covered the Repertory Grid and Personal Construct Psychology in general and as a knowledge acquisition and human relations tool, there were no uses as a pedagogical technique. The list of YouTube URLs is available in Appendix [A].

#### RepPlus Boose/Bradshaw Knowledge Acquisition Reports

The Repertory Grid Technique has been widely used in knowledge acquisition context, with the RepPlus website listing many publications that reference this. Of the 28 documents listed in this source, only one was returned by lexical search, which was not in a higher education context. For the papers on knowledge acquisition, the ENL is at <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0vkixa9vkn7c45a/AABiqK67zGY7z2g-Li2LeijFa?dl=0>.

### Summary of Search Stage 1

At the end of this phase, I have demonstrated that there is a substantial body of work around the Repertory Grid Technique in higher education settings, spread across multiple databases with many requiring full-text to properly review, and with many being theses perhaps not as accessible to researchers as they could be. Summarises the results of this Stage. The next step is to removed duplicates from the datasets, then review the studies in more detail to see if they are a good fit for my research question.
