1. Current state of learning and knowledge theories in the Learning Sciences


1. Personal Construct Psychology
- Constructive Alternativism
- Fundamental Postulate
- Corollaries

1. Systematic Scoping Literature Review
- Methodology
- Findings (trends?
- Discussion
- Conclusions

1. The Repertory Grid Technique
- Theoretical foundation
  - Kelly's design
- Administration
  - Elements
  - Constructs
  - Poles
  - Elicitation
- Data

1. Tools & Methods

- WebGrid and RepPlus
- Offline RepGrids
- Administration
- Data
- Representations

1. Analysis
- Statistical foundation
  - Cluster Analysis
- Built-in options
  - Compare
  - Exchange
  - Minus
  - Nets, etc.

1.  Use Cases / Potential (can use examples from 5024)
- At the moment RepGrid is limited to things like Marketing, but little on how the students actually learn this, especially the interpretation step (use online & manual methods for interview & data analysis)
- As a research method for HDR students (and acad staff) --> HDR training, FASS and Business in particular
  - Research teams, teamwork contexts
- As a method in the context of Leadership Education --> Ehssan, others in Psych and Bussiness

- As a tool in the context of collaborative/group learning, perhaps other graduate attributes--> DVCE
  - how can students use RepGrid for collaboration & problem-solving?
- As a knowledge measurement/assessment method --> FASS, DVCE
  - Interdisciplinary courses - is there any mention of RepGrid in ID or Assessment Design
  - Empirical study of 5024
- Professional Development Workshops
  - Interdisciplinary courses - is there any mention of RepGrid in ID or Assessment Design, anti-plagiarism & measures against self, how can it be used for grading interdisciplinary tasks between graders?
  - Empirical studies of PD

1. Limitations and Opportunities
- Multiple facets
- Not reducible to one dimension
- Interdisciplinary tool to address wicked problems

1. Summary and future research directions
