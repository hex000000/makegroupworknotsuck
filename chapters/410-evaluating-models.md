## Assessing model quality

Assessing student group work products can be problematic in higher education as we have seen in the Literature Review. In these studies, while the models were individually different because they were created for different contexts, I needed to find a way of evaluating them that was domain-agnostic. We still need to look at content in relation to whether multiple perspectives are observable, but more important for our purposes is to look at them holistically as a materialisation of the group&#39;s approach to each problem. Interestingly, looking across the different theories combining in these studies, one evaluative framework is present across design, group problem-solving, epistemic mediation and personal construct theory. We will explain this lens of &quot;integrative complexity&quot; first, then describe how it is useful in evaluating group model building.

{Suedfeld, 1977 #8095} coined the term &quot;integrative complexity&quot; to distinguish between the kind of complex individual thinking associated with inherent personality characteristics and the kind of complex thinking observable through information processing artefacts. In their studies of critical communications from decision makers under pressure in 1914 and 1962, they looked for active interpretation and manipulation of information in contrast to plain description in the documents they reviewed {Suedfeld, 1977 #8095}. The thinking underpinning this is around the increased volume of information that needs to be processed as unstable international affairs increase the perceived need for rapid decisions. The combination of information overload, urgency and potential impact of these decisions reduces the information processing complexity capacity of individuals. This is exacerbated when traditional information channels become inadequate and the additional load flows through non-traditional channels. The longer the stress occurs, the more the complexity of information processing decreases. In contrast, the more differentiated characteristics are recognised, the more complex the connections are among these characteristics, and the number of perspectives increases. These connections are the &quot;integration&quot; of ideas, and the &quot;complexity&quot; refers to the application of system principles such as interaction between characteristics and observable patterns. When decisions are made without complex differentiation, it can lead to the appearance of only one solution to a problem, with both people and situations characterised as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and rapid solutions sought to minimise uncertainty and ambiguity. We see a lot of that in group work. On the other hand, engaging with complexity allows flexibility though combinations of ideas and deliberate inclusion of new information to enable multiple points of view to exist simultaneously. That does not necessarily mean that the decision is always moral or appropriate. This is consistent with the ideas in the Learning Sciences about cognitive bandwidth and offloading \&lt;maybe I need to describe this more here or in the Discussion\&gt;.

\&lt;Do I also need to give a para to the idea of conceptual complexity theory from personality theory? Their paragraph completion test is bound to be like the contemporary sentence completion test\&gt;

Integrative complexity is important in our context of interdisciplinary and distributed teamwork because {Suedfeld, 1977 #8095} found that lower levels of complexity are associated with war as the problem outcome, with higher levels associated with peaceful resolution. While the participant cohort discussed in {Gruenfeld, 1993 #8596} is not clearly defined, in that study integrative complexity analysis of student essays discussing how workshop activities related to course content to find that high levels of group average integrative complexity are associated with better performance on group tasks relating to conceptual synthesis and problem-solving (p399). Over the course of their study, the level of group integrative complexity increased to a point where it was significantly greater than that of the average individual, and not statistically different from that of the highest individual member (p401). However, no significant association between group integrative complexity and performance on judgemental or decision-making tasks was found, and, importantly for our study, no association with tasks that could be completed individually {Gruenfeld, 1993 #8596}(p401). They propose that the explanation for this is that over time group members become more &quot;able or motivated&quot; to include multiple perspectives when constructing their shared products, resulting in conceptual and cognitive growth. The similarities to group model building are clear.

{Cummings, 1995 #8089} followed Gruenfeld and Hollingshead (1993) with the hypothesis that group integrative complexity over time exceeds average complexity of member ideas. They followed {Tetlock, 1989 #8100} coding schema, dividing structural properties between differentiation and integration as shown in Table [T] below (p 635)

| Tetlock (1989) level | example |
| --- | --- |
| Score 1 (low differentiation-low integration). | Capital punishment is a barbaric practice. A civilized society does not deliberately take the lives of its citizens to avenge crimes. It makes no difference how evil the crime. The basic rule still stands: &quot;Thou shalt not kill,&#39; I don&#39;t know why some people have such a hard time understanding this. |
| Score 3 (moderate to high differentiation-low integration). | I&#39;m of two minds on this issue. Some crimes are so disgusting that they cry out for the ultimate penalty. But I&#39;m also worried about executing an innocent person. Our courts are not perfect. |
| Score 5 (moderate to high differentiation-moderate integration). | I can see why people disagree on capital punishment. A lot depends on whether you look at the issue from the point of view of the victims or from the point of view of the criminals. Victims want revenge. Criminals want leniency--and leniency may be justified sometimes depending on the circumstances. On balance, I support the death penalty, but only when there is no doubt regarding guilt and only when the crime is especially vicious. |
| Scores of 7 reflect high differentiation and high integration. | Scores at this level require awareness of complex value trade-offs or of complex relationships between different ways of looking at the world. |
| Scores of 2, 4, and 6 represent transition points between adjacent levels. |

While (Cummings) is focused on the deconstruction of a problem solution to take advantage of multiple inputs, {Jonassen, 2005 #7019} looks for &quot;explanatory coherence&quot; in model analysis, based on {Thagard, 2018 #8104} \&lt;should I discuss Thagard more in-depth?\&gt;. As well as logical, probabilistic, and semantic coherence, Jonassen suggests a range of measures which attend more to the technical quality of the model, even those models that are conceptual rather than concrete. In fact, he argues that the only way the inconsistencies in internal conceptual structures can be addressed is to develop a revised model that can integrate new information with personal beliefs and suppositions. Jonassen makes a point which, while simple, is a significant insight in relation to conceptual structures. That is, when relationships between concepts or their classification is incorrect, they can not be used to solve problems (p32). This theory is based in the role of cognitive conflict and ontological beliefs in human development. In Jonassen&#39;s model (Figure 7 p 30), cognitive conflict occurs when human experiences are &quot;interpreted&quot; &quot;correctly&quot; or &quot;incorrectly&quot;, and ontology shifting when the meaning given to a concept is mis-categorised, requiring adjustment to a more appropriate classification. What isn&#39;t articulated, but could be suggested, is that before the &quot;experiencing&quot; occurs, humans have an idea about what is to come. This is what Kelly would call &quot;prediction&quot;, and the analysis of how the experience is interpreted is &quot;man as scientist&quot;, constructing new predictions about the next experience based on that feedback.

(p17)

Both these perspectives are relevant to the models created by students in this study, at least on the poles of the continuua.

All team used their Adobe Connect meeting rooms and in most cases made a successful recording \&lt;in Limitations mention pre-Zoom\&gt;. Team A had more empty recordings than any other team, and they also had more meetings overall, with a lower average time per meeting.

Each team&#39;s GitHub repo was established with the same contents Figure [F] shows the initial configuration in system model format. Eleven document templates, 28 illustrations of process and structure, 28 modelled examples and seven structured collaboration activities were provided as documents and UML code models.

Team A organised their Minutes documents in a separate folder and followed the templated filename protocol. They used the numbers, checkboxes, section breaks, links and heading styles contained in the template. Where tasks were assigned, the team member&#39;s name or nickname was adjacent to the action item in the Minutes.
