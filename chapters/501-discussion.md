# Discussion

\&lt;to do\&gt;

# Proposal research questions:

. How do groups create and develop knowledge objects for (a) modelling and (b) group regulation purposes?

. How do groups appropriate designer-provided notations, tools, roles and workflows? (First level appropriation)?

. How does the expectation to have to communicate insights and practices regarding (a) and (b) to another group—the &quot;target&quot; group—affect knowledge building of the &quot;source&quot; group&#39;? (&quot;Production effect&quot;)?

. How does the information on (a) and (b) made available from another group—the source group—affect the target group? (&quot;Variation effect&quot;)

.. How do groups appropriate tools and workflows provided by another group? (Second level appropriation)

 - cluster analysis to identify thematic groupings {van de Kerkhof, #8428;Bell, 2005 #8493}

 - frequency analysis to ensure true range of relevant elements and constructs have been elicited (saturation) {van de Kerkhof, #8428}

 - frequency analysis to identify the most mentioned constructs {van de Kerkhof, #8428}

 - exploratory factory analysis to examine relationships between elements and constructs {Aditomo, 2011 #7740}

Emergent analysis

In the context of the thesis, I am framing RepGrid as measurable proximity to other learner models including that of the instructor/expert, with that measurement showing the appropriation of (a) language within/across groups as one type of conceptual model and potentially (b) as an unintended pattern appropriation despite differences in language.

The idea is that in the process of appropriating the kinds of models we intended (and none of the designed environment), other not always explicit models, like how to fit into a randomly-formed team (which isn&#39;t RepGrid data, that&#39;s from student reflections).

This will be discussed in the context of the broader idea of appropriation of (a) the designed environment, (b) the model forms and notations.

-\&gt; Contrast between T1 &amp; T2, eg T-2 to T1 compare

note the introduction of concrete constructs such as water wastage and sustainable use of resources

eg FUVOH – how does this fit with the Report &amp; Reflection?

Contrast those whose group scores were better than their individual scores:

Low quality constructs -\&gt; lower team performance?

Better quality constructs -\&gt; higher team performance?

![](RackMultipart20200829-4-1m17u0u_html_7b72056d7ad152b.png)

Fewer high-performing participants generating better quality constructs.

![](RackMultipart20200829-4-1m17u0u_html_f8b4edd09ef4d50d.png)

More high-performing participants generating better quality constructs but lower performance as a group.

Can the interaction data explain the difference between these two groups who both had 4 retained constructs? One did better as a team and the other did less well.

RepGrid as a predictor of performance at individual &amp; group level
 - did they do the grid?
 - were their constructs derivative of role titles
 - did they generate many constructs?
 = is there a relationship between any of these on task performance (as rated by instructor and as discussed by others in team).


Re-do anlaysis through phenomenographic lens.
Remember to discuss the utility of RepGrid + phenomenography as suited to culturally secure environments, overcoming traditional barriers to the voice of those researched and giving them ownership of their ideas in language.
