## Study 2

### Participants &amp; context

The participants [_N_=5, 4 females, 1 male] [_N_=7, 6 females, 1 male) were enrolled students in a postgraduate Learning Sciences unit that engages learners in computational modelling of complex systems. Participants were verbally advised about the study and its purpose, and provided with both Participant Information Statement (Appendix [A]) and Participant Consent Form (Appendix [A]) which explained the study and their options for consent, as well as the data that would be collected and how it would be used. The population is not considered vulnerable as it comprises postgraduate, generally adult, students who are accustomed to the communication channels usually used by the University, such as Canvas, and whose levels of language competence are appropriate to tertiary study.

Participation in the study was voluntary, and neither instructor nor researcher knew which students were participating until all assessable work was returned and administrative processes complete. The group project task was cross-graded by another Learning Sciences academic to ensure even unintentional bias was avoided.

The sample is consistent in size and composition with {Damşa, 2016 #7100}&#39;s Teaching Education Professional Environments cohort and the Learning and Educational Technology students participating in the study by {Järvelä, 2013 #7115}, and is typical for a unit of this kind.

The small number of students enrolled in the unit meant that there was only one group engaged in a team project, which we did not commence until Week 5, this time after Census. The group project reported on comparative scenrios of technology implementation. Throughout the teaching session, each student created a peer resource on a topic related to weekly readings, and conducted a synchronous video peer tutorial using the Adobe Connect webconferencing system. Students elaborated on these topics in the individual essay task at the end of the semester.

\&lt;/ highlighting specific diff with bold?\&gt;

All documents and artefacts such as diagrams and notes, including the resources for project and group management, were managed by the single team in their GitHub wiki. The class repo was used for lighter weight scaffolding resources than in Study 1. An example of the resources provided in each group&#39;s GitHub repository is shown at Figure [F].

_Figure 1: Example of the activity templates in each group&#39;s GitHub repo._

Fewer meetlet resources were explicitly provided in this study as they were not widely adopted in Study 1 and we wanted to simplify the environment. However, the meetlets were available as links from the design steps. The design steps were retained as a higher-level summaries of options for team activities. An screen shot of the _Convergent_ design step and the links to meetlet resources is at Figure [F].

In this study the participants again used Adobe Connect. Because there was a single small group, they used the all-class meeting room to discuss their projects in class time. However, these meetings were not recorded. In Week 9 of session Adobe Connect was withdrawn as a teaching tool across the university. For the remaining part of semester, the class used Zoom for all activities and no classes or meetings were recorded.

### Designed task

Aligned with the unit Learning Outcomes and major assessment task, student groups used the principles of complexity science to develop a briefing paper and agent-based modelling (ABM) scenarios for best-and worst-case organisational technology adoption. Agent-based models are a relatively new approach to modelling complex systems, with individual _agents_ having programmed behaviours{Macal, 2010 #7567}. Over time, these individual behaviours may allow the emergence of unprogrammed patterns to be observed, difficult in other modelling tools that can not reflect the adaptation of agents as they interact with each other and with/within a larger system. It is the kind of modelling used in epidemiology, for example, setting up a range of actors with and without infection, programming their behaviour, and observing how the infection is spread over time {Dénes, 2020 #8040}. As our students often need to develop policies and practices across social and organisational contexts, ABM can provide insights into critical points and optimal variables that might improve their probability of success.

While ABM at a sophisicated level is complex, and model construction was not mandated in the group task, learners in this unit were scaffolded with in-class demonstrations, partial models to complete, and a tutorial devoted to learning ABM from a professional programmer (thanks Erica!) in Week 4. In this workshop we used templates from the [NetLogo website](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) {Wilensky, 1999 #8039} and pre-made each-stage models to do a hands-on progamming task under the tutor&#39;s guidance. The was was representative of the concepts involved in the team project model, individual actors – pickpockets in the task, employees in the project model – interacting with others and changing their state by a specified parameter – money theft in the task, technology adoption in the project model. Like UML models, the NetLogo programming environment offers synchronised representations of both code and result, allowing instant feedback on the impact altering a variable has on the system. Screen shots of the code and interface displays are at Figures [FF].

_Figure 4: Code view in the ABM workshop for Study 2._

While, as in the previous study, the group met using Adobe Connect and then Zoom, the small class and group size combined with the feedback from Study 1 led to less scaffolding around group process. Teams generally met synchronously in class time and these meetings were not recorded, and given that two students of the seven had experience with meeting management from Study 1, only the activities around mental model alignment/divergence, creating agreement and consensus/convergence, and generating commitment/evaluation were provided in the class repo. As mentioned above, we provided an ABM workshop in class, and there were templates for several simple models in the repo but no other technical or meeting support was required. There was also little required from the learners during the session, which is discussed in more detail below.

### Data Collection in Study 2

Participants were surveyed five times over the teaching session, with each survey taking around ten minutes of time in class. At the end of the teaching session, the GitHub data which included the group task products was also collected.

### Data collection 1

Learners were surveyed in Week 3 of session, using the WebGrid application on a local server at the university. This survey was intended to find the concepts students found most difficult to differentiate, the &quot;muddiest points&quot;. These are all terms used in previous weeks&#39; lectures and readings and subsequently through the teaching session, and the class was asked to post those they found difficult on the unit of study Discussion Board in the Learning Management System (LMS). Participants were shown a selection of three _elements_ (the items comprising the system of enquiry) and were asked to differentiate two elements from one, and describe why one is less related to the others. Respondents managed between one and four constructs in the time allowed. As the external survey server had proved unstable in Study 1 and the IT restructure was complete, I had created an instance of the server on a University of Sydney virtual machine. This added an additional complexity for respondents as it required participants to install the University&#39;s Virtual Private Network (VPN) on their device if they were not on the campus network while doing the survey. As the participants had widely differing levels of technical expertise, and this installation required &quot;administrator&quot; access on their device, a lower level of construct development could have resulted from general technological anxiety due to this additional task.

The _elements_ presented were:

- model
- agent
- modeller
- system
- pattern

### Analysis –Data Collection 1

The first survey in this study was intended to find the concepts students found most difficult to differentiate, the &quot;muddiest points&quot;. Of the six participants, one generated four constructs, three generated three constructs, one two constructs and one participant one construct. Raw participant responses are at Figure [F] below.

#### Cluster analysis to identify thematic groupings

In this study, in contrast to Study 1, our &quot;eyeball analysis&quot;, shows fewer &quot;?&quot; responses, and fewer ratinga in the middle of the continuum. We could consider that to indicate that even though these are difficult terminologies, participants are more certain about how they think about them, although there is a certain counter-intuitivity to that suggestion. As Study 1 showed the RepGrid clustering to be a fair equivalent for manual thematic analysis, we move directly here to the FOCUS output from the survey, with both contructs and elements sorted so that the most similar across both data types are together, shown at Figure [F] below. As participant &quot;bunul&quot;&#39;s response is not meaningful, with &quot;person&quot; and &quot;5&quot; as the continuum poles, that has been removed from the analysis, but will be kept in mind when we analyse subsequent data collections, again to see if paucity of responses can be indicative of subsequent performance.

![](RackMultipart20200603-4-1hygy83_html_e46038a06a5d0f02.png)

_Figure 6: FOCUS cluster of responses. Data/5024-S2-2019/5024-0-3-muddyp-DEID/EDPC5024-muddyp-1.rgrids -\&gt; Composite -\&gt; Focus Cluster_

We can see that there is broad similarity between participants&#39; construing of _agent_ and _modeller_, and between _system_ and _model_, with _pattern_ more closely aligned with the latter. The language around _modeller_ includes _person_ twice, _designer_ and _modeller_ once each, with three of the remaining eleven consructs relating to individual activity: _creates the model_ (counted once although contributed twice for the same participant)_, singular,_ and _individual._ That all makes sense, as class content and activities have been considering modelling as an activity mostly controlled by humans. Perhaps more interesting is the similarity of construal with _agent_, a quite different concept in this class, being a programmable data point which can modify itself and other _agents_ through variable-controlled interactions. However, this survey was conducted the week before the in-class tutorial on the NetLogo programming environment for agent-based modelling. This points to the opportunity to check whether this construal changes in the next survey on these elements in Data Collection 5.

The elements _pattern, model_ and _system_ also provide an interesting set of construals. One participant construed _system_ and _pattern_ closely with scores of 4 and 5, in complete contrast to _model_ scoring 1 on the continuum _observerable_ to _can be manipulated_, indicating the both _system_ and _pattern_ can be manipulated but _model_, with _agent_ and _modeller_ are all _observable_. Again, it is more closely aligned with class content that a model and agent are manipulable and a pattern would be observable output of those manipulations. The same participant clustered _agent, modeller_ and _pattern_ at the _part of the system_ end of the continuum with _model_ and _system_ at the _contains patterns_ pole. This is valid construal consistent with course content, with another participant making a similar distinction (almost identical ratings on the elements) between _singular_ and _complex_. Another close match between participant construals (leaving aside the almost duplicate responses by participant &quot;yanada&quot;) is _agent_ and _modeller_ again clustered in contrast to _system, model_ and _pattern_ by both &quot;duruga&quot; and &quot;yanada&quot;, with &quot;duruga&quot; using the quite wordy construct _system&#39;s properties are reliant on modeller and agent_ at the _agent_ and _modeller_ end of the continuum and _they can both be controlled_ about _system, model_ and _pattern_ at the other pole. Participant &quot;yanada&quot; rated the elements almost identically between the poles of _individual_ and _involves lots of agents_.

Overall, the distinction is between active and passive constructs, different kind of rules_creates, defining, conducting_ versus _occurs, result, controlled, made, manipulated_. As in Study 1, several participants provided very similar constructs in multiple responses. The length of the construct descriptions in themselves give an indication of how challenging the participants found this disentangling of concepts that in many cases were relatively new to them. The cluster grid after removing these near-duplicates which in almost all cases referred to the idea of creator versus creation is below at Figure [F].

![](RackMultipart20200603-4-1hygy83_html_1ce8c3f5c3831221.png)

_Figure 7: FOCUS cluster of responses. /Data/5024-S2-2019/5024-0-3-muddyp-DEID/EDPC5024-muddyp-1-pruned2.rgrid -\&gt; Focus Cluster_

Even with those constructs removed, the element clustering is retained, with _model_ and _system_ together, _agent_ and _modeller_ together, and _pattern_ closer to _model_ and _system_. Construct clustering shows the closest match between _part of the system/model/singular_ and _complex/contains patterns,_ again consistent with course content_._ The next closest, _System&#39;s properties… / They can both be controlled,_ and _individual/involves lots of agents_ is not as easily aligned with content, but the underlying paradigm of RepGrid is that the precise wording of construals is less important than the similarity of the ratings. Despite these being different construals, the ratings show that &quot;duruga&quot; and &quot;yanada&quot; agree that the elements are differentiated from each other in a specific way, even if the expression of that differentiation is not the same. Participant &quot;burawa&quot;&#39;s ratings along the _component/big picture_ continuum is also very close to those responses, the next most similar construct, with these five constructs generated by four participants generally aligned except for the ratings on _pattern_, creating the larger cluster. As the next cluster is less aligned in both ratings and construct terminology, the larger cluster gives a rapid insight into how the participants are framing the elements and in which areas they may benefit from learning activities targeted at the potential misconstrual of _agent_ we can see.

#### Principal Components Analysis

As in Study 1, we return to the dataset modelled at Figure [F6], with the meaningless response removed but very similar responses retained. Why is this helpful? In the Principal Components Analysis at Figure [F] below, the spatial representation of elements and constructs does not have the grid constraints of FOCUS.This makes it possible to see the relationship between those very similar responses, and a more nuanced understanding of how they might be different in the eyes of the participant, while to me they seem very close. For example, participant &quot;yanada&quot; places _creates the model_ at the pole of two constructs, with the other poles being _both a result of the modeller_ for _pattern, model_ and _system,_ and _part of the model_ for _agent_ and _system_ with &quot;?&quot; ratings for _pattern_ and _model_. They also repeat _result of the modeller_ at the pole of _modeller_ for _pattern, model_ and _system_, with _agent_ associated with _modeller_ on the other pole. This shows how at this stage of teaching session – Week 3 – these elements of complexity theory may still understood only at a superficial level, which is to be expected. This is a useful method for understanding not only that the participants still have varied understanding of the system of enquiry, but in which ways that understanding is different.

_Figure 8: PrinGrid map of elements and constructs. Data/5024-S2-2019/5024-0-3-muddyp-DEID/EDPC5024-muddyp-1-pruned.rgrids -\&gt; PrinGrid_

In his development of the PrinGrid representation for RepGrid, {Slater, 1965 #1795} discusses the prime importance of the elements and constructs furthest away from the origin (if you think of the horizonal line in the chart above being the X axis and the vertical line as Y, with the point at which they intersect being the origin). He describes their role as as _massgebend_, defining the direction and scale in which all other elements are placed {Slater, 1965 #1795} (pp 971-972). This is because the major axis of the PrinGrid is formed by combining all the constructs with positive and approximately equal weights. The second axis is oriented to those constructs which contrast with those on the first, showing us the top two distinctions made by the respondents. In both cases, the length of the lines indicates the variance in ratings between the two constructs. For example, at Figure [F7] we can see that participant &quot;gura&quot; rated _agent_ and _modeller_ at 1 and the other elements at 5 along the _simple_/_complex_ continuum, represented in Figure [F8] by a long line from the lower left hand corner to the upper right hand corner. Overall, the participants differentiated _agent_ and _modeller_ from the other elements on constructs to do with agency and independence, _person,__conducting, creates_ versus _part of, result, reliant._ Other constructs are less clear; _can be manipulated_ or _controlled_ at the _agent_ and _modeller_ end versus _observable_ or _System&#39;s properties…_ associated with _model_, but not _system_ or _pattern._

Looking at individual PrinGrids for those responses furthest away from the origin can deepen insight. Figure [F8] shows _system, model_ and _pattern_ grouped together when all responses are included for analysis, showing that - overall – participants gave them similar rating patterns across all constructs. However, &quot;gura&quot;&#39;s data by itself shows only two main components, with _system_ and _model_ grouped on the right, _agent_ and _pattern_ to the left, _modeller_ here is centred between those groups. While overall the group did not distinguish _modeller,_ this participant rated it &quot;1&quot; for every construct, while the other elements all have ratings at both construct poles. So for this participant the first component is the differentiation between _complex/construct defining attributes_ and _singular/occurs in the model,_ and the second the distinction between _designer_ and _made by the designer_.

_Figure 9: PrinGrid map of elements and constructs. Data/5024-S2-2019/5024-0-3-muddyp-DEID/Gura.rgrid -\&gt; PrinGrid_

In contrast, &quot;duruga&quot;&#39;s data at Figure [F] also contains two main components, with _system_ and _model_ grouped on the right again, but _agent_ and _modeller_ to the left, and _pattern_ close to the centre between those groups. While overall the group did not distinguish _pattern,_ this participant rated it &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;5&quot; over the constructs, a pattern differing only slightly from _model_, which is why the two elements are aligned vertically, but quite different from the other element ratings. For this participant the first component is the differentiation between _agent/modeller_ and _system,_ and the second the distinction between _pattern_ and _model_, where the pattern of rating is very similar but at opposite poles with the exception of _System&#39;s properties…/they can both be controlled._ From a unit content point of view, the clustering and rationale indicate some confusion that would be overcome over the following weeks of session.

#### Exploratory factor analysis to examine relationships between elements and constructs

#### Frequency analysis

Following {van de Kerkhof, #8433} and Study 1, Table [T] and Figure [F] below shows the count of constructs generated, using the dataset shown at [F6], with similar responses retained but one null response removed. Again with participants concurrently providing survey responses it is not possible to assign a known sequence to the constructs. This group was smaller than that in Study 1 (N versus N) and fewer constructs generated, 15 after removal of one null value. Again, saturation can not be strictly claimed as each participant added unique constructs. However, some constructs were so similar and repetitive it is likely that effective saturation has been met, and technical saturation achieved with few further iterations.
