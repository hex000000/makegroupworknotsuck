## Study 3

### Participants and context

The participants [_N_=31, 12 females, 19 males] were enrolled students in a first-year undergraduate Engineering unit that engages leadership scholarship recipients in holistic solution development toward the United Nations global Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) {United Nations, 2020 #8041}. In common with Studies 1 and 2, system modelling is embedded in the unit&#39;s major assessment task, with the complex systems addressed being poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice. Participants were verbally advised about the study and its purpose, and provided with both Participant Information Statement (Appendix [A]) and Participant Consent Form (Appendix [A]) which explained the study and their options for consent, as well as the data that would be collected and how it would be used.

The population in this study is quite different from those in Studies 1 and 2. Where those studies comprised mostly adult postgraduates, the majority of these students completed Year 12 last year with a tertiary admission rank of 98% or higher {The University of Sydney, 2019 #8042}. As well as a larger population, there is more gender parity, which effect (or not) will be observable. While there is an argument that as first year students they may be more vulnerable than postgraduates, they are electing to participate in a program where they must achieve an average grade of at least 75% in every year of study to maintain their status, so are likely to have higher than average academic ability. More importantly, the unit in which this study takes place has a focus on global leadership, and their major project requires partnership with an external mentor or organisation/s to create an innovative and implementable solution to an issue that fits within the SDG framework. This requires evidence of their capacity to productively engage with a range of stakeholders from various disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, to work in high-functioning teams leading change, and to be able to reflect on the metacognitive insights they experience during this process. The Repertory Grid activities conducted here contribute to all these outcomes through modelling individual and team thinking structures, with those structural models being the object of one knowledge exchange. The groups also engaged in two other knowledge exchanges, with peer feedback on both their preliminary report and presentation tasks prior to formal submission.

Participation in the study was voluntary, and neither instructor nor researcher knew which students were participating until all assessable work was returned and administrative processes complete. The group project task was cross-graded by the industry partners/ mentors to ensure even unintentional bias was avoided.

### Collaborative context

Over seven weeks (Week 6 to Week 13 of the teaching session), the groups worked in a team-based, intentionally-designed CSCL environment to co-create a solution to a defined or student-generated problem related to the SDGs. The solution was submitted both as a comprehensive report including system diagrams representing integration and impact on the environment, and a 6-minute video explaining the solution and implementation measures in everyday language. Students also completed one individual presentation and one individual reflective essay over the session; shown in light grey at Table [T].

In Week 5 of teaching session, the University moved to fully-online teaching as a result of the CoVid19 pandemic. From that point, all teacher-student interaction took place over Zoom for synchronous sessions and Canvas for asynchronous activities, with students free to use their preferred platform for the collaborative tasks. In the Week 3 and 4 tutorials, we used Zoom during the tutorials even though students were physically present, so we all had some experience in the format before it became necessary, and once it was necessary, all classes used it across the year/university.

### Designed environment

The changed demographic for Study 3 needed to be specifically addressed in the environment design. First year school leavers are commonly enrolled in up to six different units, often across disciplines, and are less likely – particularly the Dalyell cohort – to be employed full-time and have adult family commitments. As they all need to use the Canvas LMS as undergraduates, all material supplied was linked from within the LMS. A Group Home was created for each team, which has built-in tools for collaboration, and within this were links to other collaboration resources as well as lightweight instructions on how to apply the tools in the group task. A Padlet {, 2020 #8043} customised visually by me to each group&#39;s project was embedded in the board as well. A screen shot of the Group Home Announcement and Discussion Board is at Figures [FF].

This information was also provided in the class Discussion Board, which was a single page of notes, questions and answers, and the agendae for tutorials once the team task had begun. The result is an intentional under-design, low-level scaffolding with more time using the environment for varied tasks than being taught to use it. Table [T] below shows the blend of environment and task design features, not always neatly separable. \&lt;? not sure if I should blend these like this /?\&gt;

Tutorial (global f&amp;r for class) activities focused around the Designed Task below.

### Designed task

Studies 1 and 2 made the difficulties associated with infrastructuring collaborative environments in real-life contexts clear. Because of this, the focus in Study 3 was to embed collaborative modelling in tutorial activities, reducing the attention to platform-tool and foregrounding the co-construction aspect of creating shared artefacts embodying a model relevant to their assigned tasks. Aligned with the unit Learning Outcomes and group assessment tasks worth 55% of the course mark, student groups iteratively created project reports and presentations about solutions to sustainability issues in Australia and elsewhere. High-scoring model reports from the preceding year were available for students to review (but no bad ones and we really need bad ones for the contrast). Students were assigned mentors who were to guide them through the process of constructing this report and an accompanying (originally live) video presentation highlighting their project. A key aim of this unit to focus on actually implementable solutions and to engage with stakeholders as part of their design process, and the rubric criteria refer explicitly to these points.

Student groups draft a Preliminary Report in Week 10 with the express aim of receiving instructor feedback in a low-weighted task they can then incorporate into the Final Report, which is more heavily weighted in their unit grade. Each team also works on a presentation about their project, originally planned as an in-class presentation but changed to a six-minute video submission when teaching moved to fully online. The last task in the taught unit is a reflective task based on the output from the psychometric tests the lecturer uses as part of the course content. Artefacts from all the tutorial group activities was collated and made available on the Discussion Board in Week 13, two weeks prior to the reflection task due date.

The design affordances listed above were available to students from the time of group formation, and in Weeks 5-7 each tutorial included a group activity using the tools and processes provided. Groups were formed differently for each activity, depending on the activity purpose. For example, for a problem-solving exercise, I created groups with the widest possible disciplinary spread, for example, Aeronautics, Maths, Civil Engineering, Arts and Commerce. For a prior knowledge elicitation exercise, teams were randomly formed. After project teams were finalised in Week 6, their out-of-class collaboration processes were unmonitored, with students asked to contact me the tutor/researcher if they felt things weren&#39;t working out. I was responsible for supporting students in their new online environment and could respond to learner feedback about both environment and task. In this study I created one Discussion Board in the Canvas LMS with every week&#39;s topics, slides, tutorial recording and artefacts created in tutorial activities (Appendix C).

As the focus of this unit &quot;Building a sustainable world&quot; emphasises sustainability as integrated with the broader natural world, each model report contained a range of models, diagrams and charts reflecting the interdependency of social, sustainability and environmental sustainability. Figure [F] shows a Padlet of multiple different model types from the previous year&#39;s reports, and the lecturer specifically highlighted the diagram at Figure [F] in the lecture.

### Data collection in Study 3

Participants were surveyed twice over the teaching session, with each survey taking around ten minutes of time in class. Because these tutorials were conducted remotely, participants needed to have administrator access to a personal computer; an instance of the University Virtual Private Network installed, and an internet connection stable enough to complete and save the survey.

_Table 2: Data collection timeline in Study 3._

| **Data Collection** | **Teaching week
 2020 **|** Data** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Collection 1** | Week 7 (Sem 1) | Survey _N_=
_Sustainability_ |
| **Data Collection 2** | Week 12 | Survey _N_=31
_Sustainability_ |

### Data collection 1

Learners were surveyed in Week 7 of session, using the WebGrid application on a local server at the university. This survey was intended to establish a baseline for student constructs around the concept of &quot;sustainability&quot;. Participants were shown a selection of three _elements_ (the items comprising the system of enquiry) and were asked to differentiate two elements from one, and describe why one is less related to the others. The system does not account for time spent completing the activity, only the completion time is logged.

Respondents managed between zero and six constructs in the time allowed. Nine participants produced zero constructs. As in Study 2, we an instance of the server on a University of Sydney virtual machine. This added an additional complexity for respondents as it required participants to install the University&#39;s Virtual Private Network (VPN) on their device if they were not on the campus network while doing the survey and all participants were in isolation for both surveys. The participants again had widely differing levels of technical expertise, and this installation required &quot;administrator&quot; access on their device, a lower level of construct development could have resulted from general technological anxiety due to this additional task, or they simply have not been able to access the service. While we usually consider first year students to have a higher level of expertise with technology, this does not necessarily extend to traditional website formats [cite here the studies about device type phone/computer and task type].0

The _elements_ presented were:

a sustainable environment
 an unsustainable environment
 a sustainable lifestyle
 an unsustainable lifestyle
 my environment
 my lifestyle
 the ideal environment
 the ideal lifestyle

### Data collection 2

The _elements_ presented were identical to those in Data Collection 1.

### Data collection 1 - Findings

The first survey in this study was intended to find the concepts students associated with the concept of &quot;sustainability&quot; before working in groups to develop a team solution to a real world problem. Of the 31 students in class, 26 attempted the survey, with nine participants generating zero constructs. Five participants generated one construct, three generated two, two generated three, five participants generated three, one four, and three participants generated six constructs each. One empty construct was removed, leaving 47 constructs, with raw participant responses at Figure [F] below.

#### Cluster analysis to identify thematic groupings

In this study our &quot;eyeball analysis&quot; shows more &quot;?&quot; responses than number ratings in two constructs, at the very bottom and very top of the FOCUS grid shown at Figure [F] below. Construct 9 at the bottom of the list is closely matched with construct 2 on those elements which have a number rating, whereas construct 8 at the top has only two matches, one complete 1/5 polar opposite and &quot;?&quot; for elements that the next most adjacent construct had rated 4 or 5 – at the certain end of the continuum. It is debatable whether retaining these ratings for analysis is useful. One one hand, they may capture ambiguity for the respondent, for example &quot;ZJTPC&quot; rated &quot;my environment&quot; a &quot;?&quot; which might indicate they are unsure of what the element means, or don&#39;t know how to measure it, or prefer not to describe it. We can also see that participant generated other more complete constructs in subsequent responses, so it could be simply that they considered that first response a &quot;test&quot; to see how the system worked. As with Studies 1 and 2, the first survey completion for each group will be the first time they have used the survey system apart from practice surveys using the same system. However, looking the meaning of the construct, it simply describes the two elements _my lifestyle_ and _a sustainable environment_ as being similar with _aspects and behaviours … present in both_ with _an unsustainable environment_ being _… opposite…the other two_. As this is essentially a description of how the triadic elicitation process works and is not specific to the point of the survey, it makes sense to remove that construct. The other construct with only one triad that has been rated contrasts _the ideal lifestyle involves a healthy environment_ for _my environment_ and _the ideal lifestyle_ against _my lifestyle_ being _often in contradiction to the ideal lifestyle of my environment._ For me, this is a more meaningful response. While there are unrated elements on this construct for this respondent, the construct does express an interesting conflict between lifestyle and ideals. As the main purpose of this survey is to capture change that might occur in participants&#39; constructs after working on their group project, it makes sense to retain this construct to see if there is an observable difference between this data collection and the next. \&lt;No T2 – this participant discontinued due to having to support family during Covid\&gt; Construct 20 is a duplicate of construct 19, so it is also removed and the regenerated FOCUS grid is at Figure [F].

_Figure 7: FOCUS cluster of responses for Study 3. Data/1000-S1-2020/1000-2-sustain/ENGS1000-2-sustain-pruned-2.rgrid_

![](RackMultipart20200724-4-1i7g7ab_html_a79190c331c8e45a.png)

_Figure 8: FOCUS cluster of responses for Study 3 with constructs 9 and 20 removed. Data/1000-S1-2020/1000-2-sustain/ENGS1000-2-sustain-pruned-3.rgrid_

Something notably different between this grid and those in Studies 1 and 2 is the text length of the elicited constructs. While in those studies the construct text usually comprised 2-3 words [I can do a full text analysis on this if it&#39;s interesting?], here the responses are often full sentences, and in construct 20 (re-numbered after taking out previous 20 – this is a good argument for using the words or not numbering them until now). two full sentences with reasoning. The shorter responses suffer a little from similarity to the elements, for example, both _an unsustainable lifestyle_ and _an unsustainable environment_ are on the _it is not sustainable_ pole on a continuum with _they are sustainable_ opposite pole capturing _the ideal lifestyle, a sustainable lifestyle, a sustainable environment_ and _the ideal environment_. While that&#39;s not particularly useful, what is worth looking at here is the respondent&#39;s positioning of their lifestyle and environment also at the _they are sustainable_ pole.

While the first two studies focused on pedagogical investigation and did not include the participant as element, this survey was designed to contain elements of Kelly&#39;s original role-based Rep Test. The unit content emphasises the interconnectedness of humans and the natural environment, and personal responsibility for environmentally sustainable life choices, so it seemed appropriate to situate the participants within the system of interest for pedagogical purposes as well as research interest. Figure [F] below shows a FOCUS cluster comprising only two elements, _my environment_ and _my lifestyle._

![](RackMultipart20200724-4-1i7g7ab_html_a8d5c9142dcfffaf.png)

_Figure 9: FOCUS cluster of responses for Study 3 Data Collection 1 for only the elements &quot;my environment&quot; and &quot;my lifestyle&quot;. Data/1000-S1-2020/1000-2-sustain/ENGS1000-2-sustain-pruned-4.rgrid_

On these two elements, the constructs are quite neatly divided with the top 20 rating their _environment_ at the opposite pole to their _lifestyle,_ then another 20 rating their _environment_ at the same pole as their _lifestyle_, with construct 39 in the middle with ratings of 3 and 5, and at the very end four responses at the middle or undecided poles. While this might mean that half the respondents consider there is a conflict around sustainability between those two elements, on closer examination we can see that several respondents have constructs in both those clusters. For example, while KIEZV places _my __environment_ at 1 and _my__ lifestyle_ at 4 on a continuum between _passive, involuntary_ and _active, voluntary_, they also place both their _environment_ and _lifestyle_ at the opposite pole to _specific to me, the individual_ on a continuum with _the aim or goal to achieve at the other end_, which could be read as internally contradictive given that definitionally both environment and lifestyle are specific to the respondent in this survey. It is also interesting that we have differences in rating between respondents on similar constructs, for example, in the largest cluster between constructs 34 and 26, LPMDG rates both _my environment_ and _my lifestyle_ at the _May not be ideal_ pole, where (deid Saachin)&#39;s ratings for both were at the _utopian_ pole. Unlike studies 1 and 2, the highly individualised long text constructs do not easily fit with cluster interpretation
# 1
. This could be partly because they are still quite abstract concepts for the participants after only seven weeks at university and in this class, or because they are complex ideas to express succinctly. Data Collection 2 may give some insights around this.

#### Principal components analysis

In the Principal Components Analysis below at Figure [F] it is easier to see the related constructs around each element both because the display format is more suited to the long descriptors and highly polarised responses. The pattern here shows respondents differentiated _environment_ from _lifestyle_ across all constructs as shown on the bottom and top halves of the chart, and _ideal/sustainable_ and _unsustainable_ to the left and right. The elements _my environment_ and _my lifestyle_ lie near the x-origin on the _unsustainable_ side.

_Figure 10: PrinGrid of responses for Study 3 with constructs 9 and 20 removed. Data/1000-S1-2020/1000-2-sustain/ENGS1000-2-sustain-pruned-3.rgrid_

In this display we can see a range of constructs that would benefit from a human interviewer encouraging more thoughtful responses. Kelly describes how in the process of construct analysis it is necessary to deal with responses that are not a good fit for the analysis process, categorising these in classes: situational, excessively permeable, excessively impermeable, superficial, vague, or a direct product of the role title (p155). For example, the constructs relating to elements containing _environment_ that also contain _environment_, are direct products of the role title – not technically a &quot;role&quot; but here the distinction is not so important. \&lt;Discuss present but not dominant in 1,2\&gt; Eleven constructs of this class were removed, then three where both role and construct were _lifestyle_, five _sustainable_, and two _ideal._ The two constructs from KEIZV with &quot;?&quot; are also removed from the next representation, but will be retained in the data for comparison with Data Collection 2. Figure [F] shows the remaining 24 (22 excluding KIEZV) constructs in a FOCUS cluster, and Figure [F] as a PrinGrid.

Even with the reduced dataset, we can see there are still three main components represented, indicating less consistency in responses than in Studies 1 and 2., in which the first two components capture almost all responses. In the FOCUS grid, there are only five ratings of 3 across all elements and constructs, and the clustering of _unsustainable environment_ with _unsustainable lifestyle_ and _sustainable lifestyle, sustainable environment_ with _ideal environment_ are unchanged. Kelly&#39;s &quot;excessively permeable&quot; class could be applied to _defined only by me/defined by everyone_, as any new element might be described by it, outside our system of enquiry. For example, you could add the element &quot;civic duty&quot;, and still rate it meaningfully even though it does not fit with the range of convenience we are investigating. Constructs 16, 9 and 18 also fit this class and can be removed. The construct _my reality/the reality I strive for_ is in the &quot;excessively _im_permeable&quot; class, as it embraces the respondent&#39;s reality and only that so it can also be removed. We can also remove the _chill vibes/not looking good_ as it is &quot;vague&quot; from a Kellyian viewpoint. Similarly, _is not an extreme/is an extreme_ is a &quot;superficial&quot; construct providing no useful data. With these constructs removed, Figures [FF] below show how the FOCUS cluster gives us much better insight, and we can reduce the Principal Components to two.

It is not surprising that the elements _a sustainable__environment_ and _the ideal environment_ are closely construed, with an 88% match across constructs, and there is no real change to overall element clustering. However, the construct clustering has changed significantly. Where in Figure [F7] above the number of clusters was higher because constructs such as _is an environment_ matched _about environment_ and _refers to the external environment_ very closely, Figure [F] shows that with the smaller dataset, constructs from each participant are quite tightly clustered. This might mean that the respondents are not really clear on the distinctions between constructs in their mind, applying the same pattern of ratings each time. In Figure [F], we can see the _sustainable lifestyle_ and _sustainable environment_ are closely construed as _beneficial, about giving, in balance, exceptional long-term impacts, renewable behaviours, consideration, joy, mental health_ and _minimal._ This is a good example of where a PrinGrid display is useful for interpretation of complex data, and also of where data cleaning (or as Kelly suggests, follow-up procedure) is useful for simplifying that display.

#### Frequency analysis

As in the previous two studies, I counted the constructs generated using the dataset represented at Figure [F7], after one duplicate and one meaningless construct were removed from the responses. While there is an argument to be made for analysing only the final dataset of meaningful constructs, as one intention of this study is to see whether RepGrid responses can be predictive of other performance it is important to see which participants contributed the constructs that were removed during the data refinement process. Forty-five constructs were elicited from 27 participants, with nine of those being empty – that is, the form was submitted with no constructs added. As noted earlier, the responses were very wordy and a substantial number were removed as &quot;role-based&quot;, so the full breakdown is at Appendix [A] and summarised below at Table [T] below. While in Studies 1 and 2 it looked as though saturation was almost reached, in this study the high number of role constructs may indicate either that saturation was reached very early, or that the diversity among participants made saturation difficult and time-consuming. It is also difficult to establish the level of originality, as the role-based constructs were not dissimilar in a meaningful way, for example, &quot;is an environment&quot; is substantially the same as &quot;specific to environment&quot; and &quot;about environment&quot;. Given this, we will consider only those novel constructs retained after removing role constructs. In Figure [F15], these are represented by one green line data point for each individual, and as a cumulative total. While project teams had only just been finalised at the time of Data Collection 1, these charts include team information to facilitate comparison to Data Collection 2. Across these future groups of individuals, there is substantial difference in the quantity and quality of their responses.

Looking at the data from left to right, the six students in &quot;badu&quot; provided only one completed survey between them, and this one individual provided three original constructs which were retained after the data cleaning process. Of the five students in &quot;darimi&quot;, in contrast, only one student did not respond, only one provided an empty response, and the remaining three provided five constructs between them. However, three of these were removed as role constructs, resulting in two constructs being retained. Of the four students in &quot;guru&quot;, two provided empty responses, and one of those two also provided a non-empty response, as did the remaining two, so all students made an attempt. After data cleaning, still only two novel responses. In group &quot;guwing&quot;, there was only one empty response, and nine constructs provided by the remaining three students, reduced to six after cleaning. The &quot;murayung&quot; team provided only two responses from the three team members, but all four constructs generated were novel. &quot;Ngurra&quot;, with five team members, provided one empty and three non-empty forms, totalling six constructs of which three were role constructs. And by far the most productive combination, &quot;wana&quot; provided only two surveys from the four students, but after role constructs were removed nine of the twelve supplied constructs were retained as original as shown at Table [T] above. One way to hypothesise the differences between groups is:

1. Low participation and low response rate but high originality in one individual – &quot;badu&quot;
2. Low participation and high response rate with two high performing individuals – &quot;wana&quot;
3. Medium participation and medium response rate with medium low-medium originality across individuals – &quot;darimi&quot;, &quot;guru&quot;, &quot;ngurra&quot;
4. Medium participation and high response rate with medium performance across individuals – &quot;guwing&quot;, &quot;murayung&quot;.

In Figure [F15] below, the pink shading shows the original constructs elicited from each future team, as a whole, with the individual construct generation shown with the orange line marking all constructs, and the green line those constructs retained after data cleaning.

_Figure 15: Constructs generated by participants with cumulative total aggregated by future team._

The fifteen retained constructs fell into four themes, shown at Figure [F] below. Five (30%) of the constructs related to whether the element was something the respondent felt they could control, and looking back at the PrinGrid at Figure [F14], we can see this is closely associated with _my environment_, around half way between _a sustainable / ideal environment_ and _an unsustainable environment._ The positive poles of these constructs were clustered with both _my lifestyle_ and _the ideal lifestyle,_ indicating a strong relationship for the participants between how they act in relation to aligning their lifestyle with the ideal lifestyle and an environment they do not feel they can control. The next largest themes, both with four constructs, were about a balance with nature and way of living ethically. They, and the final theme around quality of life, belonged for the respondents between _a sustainable lifestyle_ and _a sustainable environment_. The polar opposites of these constructs, in many cases using explicit negatives such as &quot;not in balance&quot;, &quot;not beneficial&quot;, &quot;negative impacts&quot;, are unsurprisingly between the elements _an unsustainable lifestyle_ and _an unsustainable environment_. It was surprising, given that this is an engineering unit of study, to see an absence of corporeal or environmental constructs- real world stuff - for example, clean water supply, predicable weather patterns, soil ecology, freedom from disease, universal basic income, or absence of war. At Data Collection 2 we may see different language introduced as the participants will have almost completed their group project report.

In Study 1, we saw that among participants struggling to develop nuanced constructs that the probability of similar construing was under 50%, meaning communication may have been difficult. In this study, if we use the complete dataset, the similarity prediction baseline is only 17% shown at Figure [F] below. However, if we analyse only the seven participants that provided constructs retained after data cleaning, that minimum rises to 54%, with an 83% probability of understanding at least one other participant, seen in Figure [F] below.

Considering the differences between groups in quantity and quality of data supplied in this collection, it might be interesting to compare the probability of understanding within, and between teams. Table [T] below shows the link network model, team by team, for Data Collection 1.

One important limitation of this study is that despite the careful environment design, several features of the designed task make it difficult to evaluate the completed work model features and collaboration process as generalisable. The process by which the project teams were formed was for a list of mentors and broad topics to be provided to the students, who were invited to either select a mentor and topic or to initiate their own project provided it met a group minimum number of three (determined by the lecturer). A total of seven teams formed from the 31 students, with group size between three and six, and mentors with widely varying degrees of engagement and oversight of the group project. As mentioned above, when this survey was done in Week 7 of session, it was the first week of fully online tutorials and many students had experienced disruption including the need to relocate because of the effects on the university of the Covid19 pandemic.

### Data collection 2 - Findings

The second survey in this study was designed to find out how the participants appropriated the constructs of their peers within and across project teams as they developed solutions to problems relating to &quot;sustainability&quot;. Of the 31 students, 27 participated and there were four empty responses. Forty-seven constructs were generated, with 11 respondents generating three constructs each, four generating two, and four generating one. The four empty responses comprised two from one participant that also generated three constructs, and one who generated two meaningless constructs, with 1 at the left and 5 at the right pole on both. I think this indicates that only one of the participants who struggled with the procedure persisted in this data collection, with two out of the four empty surveys being simply unsuccessful attempts rather than successful attempts at a non-submission. Raw participant responses are below at Figure [F].

#### Cluster analysis to identify thematic groupings

In contrast to Data Collection 1, our &quot;eyeball analysis&quot; here shows no &quot;?&quot; responses in the FOCUS grid at Figure [F] below. It is perhaps reflective of the survey occurring in Week 12 of semester, when assignments are typically due, that the most closely matched constructs at the bottom of the grid are _longevity/burnout, current situation/future possibility_ and _spacially organised /disorganised_ alongside _trying to get HD /enjoyment._ The ratings for all these constructs on the elements _my lifestyle_ and _my environment_ are on the left-hand pole, with the _ideal_ and _sustainable_ elements rated on the right hand pole. These are much more concrete and personal constructs than were present in the first survey, and overall the constructs are less wordy. \&lt;Compare number of concrete/abstract constructs between T1, 2 and identify specific participants\&gt;. Immediately apparent is the distinct clustering from _Is incongruent/Both are connected_ downward where all participants have fairly polarised responses, and upward from _harder to change_/_can be modified_.

In the analysis of Data Collection 1, we looked at a FOCUS cluster of only the elements _my environment_ and _my lifestyle_ and observed there were fairly equal numbers of constructs where participants rated their lifestyle on the opposite pole to their environment, and those who rated it at the same pole. Figure [F] shows results from this survey, where 27 out of the 45 constructs were rated at the same pole for both _my lifestyle_ and _my environment_, 11 were in the middle, and only 7 constructs from five respondents still rated those elements on opposite poles. \&lt;No T2 for HNCIV\&gt;

More on the difference in [Discussion Chapter]

#### Principal Components Analysis

The Principal Components Analysis grid at Figure [F] below is both similar and different to the results from Data Collection 1 [Figure f10]. It is similar in that the same elements are in the same quadrants, and different in that responses are clustered in only two components. As in DC1, in the absence of a human interviewer prompting more nuanced responses there are a number of constructs that could be usefully removed as they are products of the role title, for example, _environment_, and _focused on environment_, and _lifestyle_, _both refer to lifestyle_ and _they relate to lifestyle_. Nine constructs of this class were removed, then five where both role and construct were _lifestyle_, eight _sustainable_, and one _ideal._ I should explain here that once a construct is removed because it contains _environment_, if it also contains another role title I do not count it again. After these 23 constructs are removed, the remaining 21 are graphed on a PrinGrid at Figure [F] below.

_Figure 22: PrinGrid cluster of responses for Study 3 Data Collection 2. /Data/1000-S1-2020/1000-4-sustain2-DEID/ENGD1000-4-sustain-DEID-pruned-3.rgrid. Full size png at /Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Documents/0\_Chapters/images/ENGD1000-4-Prin.png_

\&lt;Not sure whether I should leave this in as going to take out those three constructs on the y-axis to see effect.\&gt;

![](RackMultipart20200724-4-1i7g7ab_html_4776a763f4b7cb94.png)

_Figure 23: PrinGrid cluster of responses for Study 3 Data Collection 2 after role title constructs removed. /Data/1000-S1-2020/1000-4-sustain2-DEID/ENGD1000-4-sustain-DEID-pruned-5.rgrid._

\&lt;/consider removing\&gt;

Even after removing the role title constructs, the components change very little. Looking at the values closest to the y-axis, and remembering what Slater (1967) says about those constructs furthest from the origin – the _massgebend_ - setting the frame (p971), one way to view the constructs comprising this component is around agency and control, in a similar way to DC1. For example, _a way of living / initiated by human choice/ actions_ are all verbs implying agency, in contrast to their poles of _the space you live in/a consequence of others / only consists of surroundings._ But there is also the differentiation between the experience described – space and surroundings.[Discussion chapter about taking on the role/identity/agency]. Removing these, Figure [F] shows that the first component now represents over 80% of responses, then 10% from the construct with polarities _personal/everyone_. Compared with Data Collection 1, the responses patterns are much closer once these extraneous constructs are cleared \&lt;Should I be including specific RepGrid data numbers?\&gt;. The type of responses too is different, which will be further addressed in the Discussion Chapter.

#### Frequency analysis

I counted the constructs generated after removing three empty responses from two participants. Forty-five constructs were elicited from 21 participants, with one participant providing two null (just the numbers &quot;1-5&quot;) responses. Table [T] below shows that as in DC1, there is a difference in both quality and quantity of elicited constructs.

_Table 5: Table 3: Summary of responses from Study 3 Data Collection 2. Summary of responses from Study 3 Data Collection 2. Full data is at Appendix [A]._

Looking at the data from left to right, two of the six students in &quot;badu&quot; provided survey responses, with three and one construct respectively, all of which were retained. Of the five students in &quot;darimi&quot;, four provided responses totalling 12 constructs, 11 of which were removed as role title constructs. Three of the four students in both &quot;guru&quot; and &quot;guwing&quot; provided completed surveys, with one other team member in &quot;guwing&quot; providing an empty response. Of those teams&#39; responses, three role-derived constructs were removed from &quot;guru&quot; and one from &quot;guwing&quot;, retaining three and four constructs respectively. Two of three &quot;murayung&quot; team members contributed five constructs, with only two of one participant&#39;s retained, and two of the five &quot;ngurra&quot; students provided five constructs of which three were retained, with one of those participants also providing two empty responses. The &quot;wana&quot; group&#39;s four members generated three non-empty responses, of which four were retained. Overall, 23 role-based constructs were removed, seven _environment_, six _lifestyle_, nine _sustainable_, one _ideal_. From the original 45 constructs, with two null and 24 role-based constructs removed, 21 constructs remain. In Figure [F25] below, the pink shading shows the original constructs elicited from each active team, as a whole, with the individual construct generation shown with the orange line marking all constructs, and the green line those constructs retained after data cleaning.\&lt;Also need to come back here to check vague, superficial and excessively im- permeable.\&gt;

\&lt;Point here to Discussion Chapter on difference in participation/ performance, compared to hypothesis in DC1, and 1 same+, ¾ similar, high number of role in darimi, pattern similarity, language changes \&gt;

_Figure 25: Constructs generated by participants with cumulative total aggregated by future team for Data Collection 2._ \&lt;I think I night need rotate these on a single page to make them more readable?\&gt;

The 21 retained constructs fell into eight themes, shown at Figure [F] below \&lt;These Themes need review after DC 2 &amp; 3 there is more to see about the ideal of individual versus collective responsibility and sacrifice that would be good to discuss, as well as the resource sustainability-\&gt; Discussion\&gt;. Five of the constructs related to quality of life, however, three of those responses were from a single respondent, four from the one group &quot;badu&quot;. Four constructs were around desirability, for example, _Undesirable/What I would like to see_, _Longevity/burnout._ We again see the area of agency represented, with 20% of responses, with constructs related to externality, for example, _Only consists of surroundings/…actions and surroundings, __Spacially organised/Disorganised,_ and _a way of living/the space you live in_ also at 20%.Ethical living again is mentioned with the same number of constructs around resource sustainability. One response each related to balance with nature and the potential _future possibility_, against _current__ situation_, for sustainability. If we review the PrinGrid at Figure [F24] we can see that the elements around ideal and sustainable lifestyle and environment are clustered on the left hand side, with the associated constructs also very tightly clustered. On the right hand side, we can see _my environment_ and _my lifestyle_ closely construed with many of the more negative poles, for example, _disorganised, not as good,_ and _Burn Out._ Both _unsustainable environment_ and _unsustainable lifestyle_ are also very closely clustered with most constructs defining it in explicitly negative terms: _does not optimise…, no enjoyment, negative effects, undesirable, and bad_.

### Data collection 3 – Findings

\&lt;to do\&gt;

Not all analytic methods are available for this data as no group interaction records are available.

#### 3. Performance level – comparing elaboration of group knowledge object (and regulation objects and processes)

_Interactions /knowledge objects as unit of analysis_
 - qualitative content analysis of the final group product and interaction data to identify regulative objects and processes [including peer knowledge objects] that are associated with a more elaborate, coherent, or complex knowledge object {Damşa, 2016 #9087;Järvelä, 2013 #9230}.

#### 4. Map use of environment affordances – how are they instrumentalised differently from the intended design?

_Interactions / environment use as unit of analysis_
 - qualitative content analysis of the interaction data to establish how the learners used the collaborative environment [including peer knowledge objects] and how that might be different to the design intention {Lonchamp, 2012 #7683}

[1](#sdfootnote1anc) For the purposes of effective graph display, the construct &quot;My environment currently surrounding me is not my ideal lifestyle, there is disease everywhere! Further we are currently not in a sustainable environment therefore I would say a sustainable environment is different to my environment.&quot; will be truncated to &quot;… a sustainable environment is different to my environment&quot; in the display.
