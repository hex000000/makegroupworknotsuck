## Study 3

### Participants &amp; context

The participants [_N_=31, 12 females, 19 males] were enrolled students in a first-year undergraduate Engineering unit that engages leadership scholarship recipients in holistic solution development toward the United Nations global Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) {United Nations, 2020 #8041}. In common with Studies 1 and 2, system modelling is embedded in the unit&#39;s major assessment task, with the complex systems addressed being poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice. Participants were verbally advised about the study and its purpose, and provided with both Participant Information Statement (Appendix [A]) and Participant Consent Form (Appendix [A]) which explained the study and their options for consent, as well as the data that would be collected and how it would be used.

The population in this study is quite different from those in Studies 1 and 2. Where those studies comprised mostly adult postgraduates, the majority of these students completed Year 12 last year with a tertiary admission rank of 98% or higher {The University of Sydney, 2019 #8042}. As well as a larger population, there is more gender parity, which effect (or not) will be observable. While there is an argument that as first year students they may be more vulnerable than postgraduates, they are electing to participate in a program where they must achieve an average grade of at least 75% in every year of study to maintain their status, so are likely to have higher than average academic ability. More importantly, the unit in which this study takes place has a focus on global leadership, and their major project requires partnership with an external mentor or organisation/s to create an innovative and implementable solution to an issue that fits within the SDG framework. This requires evidence of their capacity to productively engage with a range of stakeholders from various disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, to work in high-functioning teams leading change, and to be able to reflect on the metacognitive insights they experience during this process. The Repertory Grid activities conducted here contribute to all these outcomes through modelling individual and team thinking structures, with those structural models being the object of one knowledge exchange. The groups also engaged in two other knowledge exchanges, with peer feedback on both their preliminary report and presentation tasks prior to formal submission.

Participation in the study was voluntary, and neither instructor nor researcher knew which students were participating until all assessable work was returned and administrative processes complete. The group project task was cross-graded by the industry partners/ mentors to ensure even unintentional bias was avoided.

### Collaborative context

Over seven weeks (Week 6 to Week 13 of the teaching session), the groups worked in a team-based, intentionally-designed CSCL environment to co-create a solution to a defined or student-generated problem related to the SDGs. The solution was submitted both as a comprehensive report including system diagrams representing integration and impact on the environment, and a 6-minute video explaining the solution and implementation measures in everyday language. Students also completed one individual presentation and one individual reflective essay over the session; shown in light grey at Table [T].

In Week 5 of teaching session, the University moved to fully-online teaching as a result of the CoVid19 pandemic. From that point, all teacher-student interaction took place over Zoom for synchronous sessions and Canvas for asynchronous activities, with students free to use their preferred platform for the collaborative tasks. In the Week 3 and 4 tutorials, we used Zoom during the tutorials even though students were physically present, so we all had some experience in the format before it became necessary, and once it was necessary, all classes used it across the year/university.

### Designed Environment

The changed demographic for Study 3 needed to be specifically addressed in the environment design. First year school leavers are commonly enrolled in up to six different units, often across disciplines, and are less likely – particularly the Dalyell cohort – to be employed full-time and have adult family commitments. As they all need to use the Canvas LMS as undergraduates, all material supplied was linked from within the LMS. A Group Home was created for each team, which has built-in tools for collaboration, and within this were links to other collaboration resources as well as lightweight instructions on how to apply the tools in the group task. A Padlet {, 2020 #8043} customised visually by me to each group&#39;s project was embedded in the board as well. A screen shot of the Group Home Announcement and Discussion Board is at Figures [FF].

This information was also provided in the class Discussion Board, which was a single page of notes, questions and answers, and the agendae for tutorials once the team task had begun. The result is an intentional under-design, low-level scaffolding with more time using the environment for varied tasks than being taught to use it. Table [T] below shows the blend of environment and task design features, not always neatly separable. \&lt;? not sure if I should blend these like this /?\&gt;

_Table 1: Designed environment and task features in detail._

| **Type** | **Purpose** | **Details** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Collaborative platform_ | Support synchronous &amp; asynchronous meeting activities with shared meeting tools such as whiteboard, notes, screen sharing &amp; online meeting recording. | Zoom meeting rooms are available to students and may be recorded. Zoom offers similar features to Adobe Connect, but a higher level of skill and commitment is needed to share files, record meetings and take notes.
Zoom was used for practice during in-person tutorials for two weeks prior to the unit changing to fully online. |
| _Collaborative platform_ | Support synchronous &amp; asynchronous meeting activities with project-oriented tools. Solution representation supported in any format. | All environmental features below have been added into Canvas Group Home pages as an out-of-the-box set for either asynchronous meetings or synchonrous meetings using Zoom, which supports sharing screen display and using a shared whiteboard, however, it does not support limitations to uploading shared documents for simultaneous editing.
 |
| _Conceptual scaffolding_ | Model reports, student and YouTube presentations for in-class comparisons. | Model reports in a Canvas module linked from the tutorial Discussion Board, tutorial activities rating presentations and peer-reviewing reports. |
| _Modelling tools and notation_ | PlantUML, network mapping and storyboard tools available. | planttext.com;
 kumu.io
 mural.co |
| _Group regulation tools_ | Review of project management tools in class, task to map timeslines to selected tool, in-class modelling of setting meeting agenda for tutorials. | Informed student selection of project management environment in first week of group project, supported through in-class activities. |
| _Group social &amp; epistemic tools_ | Bulleted list of collaboration steps, meetlets in template form describing typical collaboration and meeting activities such as ideation, elaboration, refinement and evaluation. | Instantiated in each Group Home in the Canvas LMS as links to services outside Canvas as well as tools within. |
| _Group design tools_ | Tools and checklists for iterative design and decision making. | Instantiated in each Group Home and class Discussion Board before the group task commenced., a brief sketch of Design Thinking cycle conducted in tutorial in Week 3 using online tools (and as it turned out, pen and paper too). |
| _Group tool scaffolding_ | Modelling use of collaborative environment Padlet in class from Weeks 1-7, short instruction and activity using PlantUML, modelling Project Management tool evaluation in class. | Low-structure scaffolding and informal peer support through system use in class for different tasks. Small formal introduction to system modelling with PlantUML in class in second week of group task. |

In class activities focused around the Designed Task below.

### Designed Task

Studies 1 and 2 made the clear difficulties associated with infrastructuring collaborative environments in real-life contexts. Because of this, the focus in Study 3 was to embed collaborative modelling in tutorial activities, reducing the attention to platform-tool and foregrounding co-construction of a shared artefact embodying a model of one kind of another. Aligned with the unit Learning Outcomes and group assessment tasks worth 60% of the course mark, student groups iteratively created project reports and presentations about solutions to sustainability issues in Australia and elsewhere. As the emphasis in sustability is tripartite – social sustainability, economic sustainability and environmental sustainability – each model report contained a range of model, diagrams and charts reflecting the systemic interaction of the solution with the broader landscape of the problem. Examples of these are at Figures [FF] below. \&lt;? or would it be better to list them by type /?\&gt;

Aligned with the unit Learning Outcomes and major assessment task, student groups used PlantUML Activity Diagrams {Object Management Group®, 1997 #7102}to construct models related to learning design. This is a simple and intuitive modelling notation, but there is still tension between what the student wants to express of their mental model, and what can be expressed in the model notation. They were encouraged to use the [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) DOT notation {Ellson, 2018 #7101} for system modelling instead of producing diagrams with a drawing tool, as the plain text format has advantages for editing, reporting and providing system feedback on model validity. An illustration of how the notation provides both a narrative and visual view on the system is at Figure [F].

_Figure 6: Example of the multiple representational format possible using UML._

Work was structured by providing tools and templates including roles that rotate between team members in turn. Each week, the _Facilitator_ prepared and guided the synchronous collaboration (including recording meetings using the web conferencing systems), encouraging full participation, transparent deliberation and shared decision making. The Facilitator was supported with a range of templates for various group activities (meeting agenda, brainstorming, structuring, voting, etc) within the learning environment. The _Knowledge Manager_ (KM) acted as scribe during the synchronous meeting, produced rich meeting records, maintained the organisation of the documents in the repository, and kept notes of experiences with system documentation management and asynchronous deliberation and decision making. The KM also helped the Facilitator to prepare meetings by providing a weekly overview of activities, decisions, and progress. In other words, he or she maintained group memory. The other students in the team took on the role of _domain experts_ with responsibilities for the research that informed their models and the group report.

The design also relied on the lecturer who taught the class and the researcher (me). My main task during the project was to support the students in their function as Facilitator and Knowledge Manager, and with their practical skills in UML modelling, GitHub and other technical areas. This included preparing them for these roles with resources and practice, as well as operational support while they were working in these roles.

During the conduct of the study, I was able to respond to learner feedback about the environment by attending classes and hearing where participants were experiencing problems with either tools or task. To make sure this knowledge was accessible, I created a wiki in the {Shaw, 1978 #8440}whole class GitHub site and the lecturer and/or I addressed each question or problem with a short explanation and links to worked examples and/or video resources. The topics covered were:

### Data Collection in Study 3

Participants were surveyed five times over the teaching session, with each survey taking around ten minutes of time in class. At the end of the teaching session, the GitHub data which included the group task products was also collected.
