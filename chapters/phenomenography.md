Phenomenography, as a learning sciences research tool, is concerned with enquiring into the variations in experience of different people in similar situations. In educational research specifically, it is concerned with what the "outcome space" is for students when asked how they structure their understanding of the system of inquiry, for example, digital affordances for collaboration {Markauskaite, 2015 #8113}. It is usually conducted by  in-person interview, in a semi-structured form, and then the individual responses aggregated to determine a "range of themes"  characterised as "categories of description", which in turn form the "outcome space". This open-ended method was developed ...

From a Learning Sciences perspective, discussion around how learning might be observed has centred for many researchers around the concept of _transfer_ {Lobato, 2006 #8120}. The key point of difference for Lobato between the classical transfer model and her actor-oriented perspective is that, instead of a formulaic response, the latter looks for any influence of previous activities, and a similarity of construing between people identified through ethnography {Lobato, 2006 #8120}. In her critique of transfer theory, she offers the additional perspective that, apart from instructor-defined learning success, _focusing phenomena_ can usefully indicate the ways in which the "prior knowledge, experience and goals" of the students  together with "mathematical language", "features of the curricular materials" and "use of artifacts" co-constitute the _object of focus_ (p. 443). This combination of representational and environmental affordances with the learner's sociocultural context is a perspective generally consistent with the theme of knowledge co-construction. That makes the next work that she then introduces in a special issue of the _Journal of the Learning Sciences_ even more surprising.

Lobato (2006) introduces the work of Ference Marton as "a radical reversal of 100 years of transfer research" (p. 443). Where others emphasised similarity between the task whose skills were intended for transfer and the destination task, Marton argues that what learners pay attention to might be the differences instead of the similarities, and that discernment is just as valid a mechanism for observing what the learner is capable of doing in subsequent situations {Marton, 2006 #8121}. Explicitly, that

"the relation between any two situations is contingent upon the relation between each of the two situations and other situations that are relevant for what is to be learned **as seen from the learnerâ€™s point of view**." {Marton, 2006 #8121}(p. 503; this author's emphasis).

Two points of Marton's here are relevant for this thesis. The first is that for any kind of situated performance measure, using two isolated situations (in sequence) as a focus lacks sufficient relational connections to be meaningful to the learner. The second is the primacy of the learner's perspective on the connections between situations. Marton uses an example from a study around children learning about light refraction and water displacement. He describes that to solve the problem (hitting a target at a different level and range from the initial target) the participants needed first to notice that as one aspect (water depth) of the problem varied, another aspect (displacement) also varied. The first thing noticed was the variation - the difference - and only then is the similarity - the simultaneity -  also seen {Marton, 2006 #8121}. The variation becomes a resource to drawn on when designing a solution.

This attention to difference was, as we have seen, controversial. However, subsequent work has shown that 

While Marton's more inclusive definition of transfer emerged as "relations between what people learn and can do in different situations" {Marton, 2006 #8121}(p. 510), he ultimately rejects the concept of transfer as redundant in favour of  systematic variation between the learning and destination situations in order to distinguish what has actually been learned {Marton, 2006 #8121}.



This is the relationship of importance for solving this particular problem.

Representation of that difference as changed





This range is similar to what in Epistemic Network Analysis might term "the universe of discourse" at a local level. It does not capture the total world conception of experience, but the realm of experiences over the cohort that is being surveyed. Both the data collection and analytical components are resource intensive, with multiple stages of interview, transcription, sorting and modelling conducted iteratively in order to collect the richest data possible. Emerging technologies such as automated transcription and qualitative data analysis applications are reducing some of the the "grunt" work, and still this method needs a thorough understanding of the disciplinary discourse in its original Martonian form.

Other researchers have varied the method

While Phenomenography is well-validated methodology with a stable research base in education, most researchers [] in this area recognise that it is difficult to conduct at scale for a number x of reasons. The first barrier is the amount of time taken to conduct the data collection and make it accessible to thematic and/or statistical manipulation. A second barrier is the nature of data collection in semi-structured interview and the complex nature of the interview record where the participants may have diverse ways of framing the question responses.


In the current 2020 research context, meeting over Zoom and being able to automatically record and transcribe interviews will be of some assistance in this regard, and emerging technologies
