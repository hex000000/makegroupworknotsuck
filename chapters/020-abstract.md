Higher education in Australia is changing. Our current environment is volatile, the influence of local and global, political and economic, machine and human decisions impacting both system and those within it deeply and at scale. The sudden and wholesale move to fully online interaction in March 2020, significant cuts to courses and staff levels, and continuing issues around Commonwealth funding have crystallised into teaching and research sites where previous paradigms of instruction and evaluation can not be maintained. If we are to continue to research how people learn, and learn together, we need to establish new ways to observe and measure what we are interested in. By designing mechanisms that are more internally robust, that can withstand some loss of environmental control, that can operate “out of the lab”, so to speak, we can enable learners, teachers and researchers to engage more deeply with their own developmental processes. By connecting these processes intelligently, we can create new knowledge and – even more importantly – we can share it.
