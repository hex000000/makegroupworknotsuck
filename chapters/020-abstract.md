Theories of learning and knowledge differ in many dimensions, but there is one point on which all agree: what you already know and how you know it will influence the outcome. This knowledge is often difficult to capture in contemporary educational environments, and the instruments used to capture it are often designed in a way which limits insight into individual or group perspectives, and how these change over time. While most frequently used in product design and marketing, the Repertory Grid Technique is a survey model for uncovering and sharing the way we construct meaning, so it has significant potential for application to knowledge contexts. In this study I conduct a systematic scoping review to identify how and where the technique has been applied in education, then develop and share evidence-based pedagogical methods and resources to support its use in educational leadership, research and practice. As we move toward increasingly inclusive and interdisciplinary leadership, collaboration, knowledge co-construction and research, Repertory Grid Technique is a powerful process for making visible those things we need to understand with others.
