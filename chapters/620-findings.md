#Findings

All tentative, limited, based on my very small datasets, although ENGD1000 was around mid-20s. After finishing writing up the data collection will re-check and summarise.
Students ignored tech affordances unless they had to use them, and supplemented them even when they did. Unproductive.
People who have lower participation, productivity and originality in RepGrids in these studies also performed at a lower level in group work, even if they performed well in individual work Potentially predictive. What if an intervention were to occur at t1?
Knowledge exchange helpful but not necessarily visible in model forms.
What does appear to be appropriated are the things we do in the tutorial/class, which in online context is helpful to know and important.
