3. Ethics mods? Sort out for Ehssan, easy for staff, harder for students. In modification, mention that E students already complete a range of surveys as part of their leadership development. Data from this study will not be identifiable in a way that can be connected with other data collected, and this researcher has no access to any other data other than my own surveys. Guard against over-survyed.
Argue about taking perspective vav Perkins, about whether or not decision-making is learning?

1. Current state of learning and knowledge theories in the Learning Sciences


1. Personal Construct Psychology
- Constructive Alternativism
- Fundamental Postulate
- Corollaries

1. Systematic Scoping Literature Review
- Methodology
- Findings (trends?
- Discussion
- Conclusions

1. The Repertory Grid Technique
- Theoretical foundation
  - Kelly's design
- Administration
  - Elements
  - Constructs
  - Poles
  - Elicitation
- Data

1. Tools & Methods

- WebGrid and RepPlus
- Offline RepGrids
- Administration
- Data
- Representations

1. Analysis
- Statistical foundation
  - Cluster Analysis
- Built-in options
  - Compare
  - Exchange
  - Minus
  - Nets, etc.

1.  Use Cases / Potential (can use examples from 5024)
- At the moment RepGrid is limited to things like Marketing, but little on how the students actually learn this, especially the interpretation step (use online & manual methods for interview & data analysis)
- As a research method for HDR students (and acad staff) --> HDR training, FASS and Business in particular
  - Research teams, teamwork contexts
- As a method in the context of Leadership Education --> Ehssan, others in Psych and Bussiness
- would be worth trying to get a paper with Ehssa if possible formatively rather than diagnostically, triangulate to check whether things are actually related, about their use: repeated surveys about leadership qualities; what about process leadership & meetings, practice support tool to provide feedback on competencies, even self-feedback. 

- As a tool in the context of collaborative/group learning, perhaps other graduate attributes--> DVCE
  - how can students use RepGrid for collaboration & problem-solving? Educational training in MLST? what is a good way to teach this to student, context when that could be applied to students outside the course, can they apply outside the course, track for post-course work *** including formative assessment, rubrics or computational rubrics, video plus exercises, eg smart sparrow type, engage the students in creating resources they might use in a business context, for learning only, doesn't ned to be perfect, PF, thinklets, brainstrorming, swot analysis etc, bring down in granularity to 10-15 minute activities, also then embedding something that can provide real-time feedback on performance in the artefact based on supporting the activity, you don't have to observing behaviour, but fine-grained artefacts that document progress - is this a good way to plan a brainstorm, conduct a RepGrid, not about them but things they produce.
  
- As a knowledge measurement/assessment method --> FASS, DVCE
  - Interdisciplinary courses - is there any mention of RepGrid in ID or Assessment Design
  - Empirical study of 5024m, offer interviews?
  
- Professional Development Workshops
  - Interdisciplinary courses - is there any mention of RepGrid in ID or Assessment Design, anti-plagiarism & measures against self, how can it be used for grading interdisciplinary tasks between graders?
  - Empirical studies of PD

1. Limitations and Opportunities
- Multiple facets
- Not reducible to one dimension
- Interdisciplinary tool to address wicked problems
