# Methodology
## Systematic scoping review

I chose the systematic scoping review as a methodological approach with the aim of providing a “baseline” for research on Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) at this point in time. A true systematic review requires multiple researchers, often working across institutions, thus unsuitable for a single PhD candidate. Even scoping reviews are sometimes done by multiple researchers, particularly if the topic has a large literature base.

Before deciding on this methodology I did some preliminary searches to check that it was viable, and discussed the approach at length and in-person with our Faculty Librarian (to whom I am very grateful).

The first part of my approach is to use a combination of the EndNote bibliographic database and the MAXQDA2020 Qualitative Data Analysis System {VERBI Software, 2017 #65} to collect and categorise the broad sweep of documents gathered through the process. A separate document describes the specific procedural steps taken within the software applications and describe how a systematic scoping review is conducted. The initial papers telling me how to do the scoping review were given to me by the Librarian and I use them here to explain how this review type is appropriate to the thesis apart from the single/multiple researcher issue. While the Joanna Briggs Institute recommends two researchers for scoping reviews {Peters, 2015 #5}, the affordances of a QDA application makes it viable for a single reviewer in a search of limited scope.  

There are many types of structured literature reviews, and while the methodology for full systematic literature reviews is well established in many fields, less rigorous methods are not as well-defined {Arksey, 2005 #7}. The ‘scoping’ approach is purposeful in this study, as I aim to review the broad range of research on using RGT in education, summarising and disseminating reports of pedagogical and research implementation, and identifying gaps in the research which could be usefully addressed. However, where scoping reviews may not traditionally measure the success of the studies it finds {Arksey, 2005 #7}, in this research I will foreground case studies which have demonstrated results and use them as models for additional methodology development.

Following the framework suggested by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), I use a staged approach to develop a research question and protocol for finding relevant studies, summarising findings, then reporting the results. I will adapt the Arksey idea of consultation in the review process in two parts. Where specific centres of practice for RGT can be identified, insights will be sought from that area around the scope and inclusiveness of the review, and whether there is anecdoctal or evidential reports of which  pedagogical models and resources are most helpful. As an important feature of systematic scoping reviews is replicability {Arksey, 2005 #7;Peters, 2015 #5}, the process I used is set out in rigorous transparency in this chapter.

## Identifying the research question
While the broad research question has been established as “How is Repertory Grid Technique used in higher education?”, Arksey and O’Malley (2005) suggest beginning by considering which aspects of the question are most important to develop a search strategy. “Repertory Grid Technique” is unambiguous conceptually and the most important feature.

However, it might be described using different phraseology, for example, RepGrid, and that must be clear in the search parameters. “Education” is potentially more difficult, as it is a very broad field ranging from 0-5 childhood right through to professional education. The target audience for this study is higher education students, instructors and researchers, which might not be specified in accessible search fields, requiring closer reading to establish. This is consistent with Arksey and O’Malley (2005) description of the process of scoping reviews as iterative and reflexive while at the same time comprehensive and documented in detail. While {Booth, 2019 #2} talks to the difficulty of iteration in a systematic way, they suggest that it is still possible to engage in a transparent manner.

{Booth, 2019 #2} realist view is based on six principles which align in many ways with those of Arksey & O'Malley (2005).    

## Finding relevant studies
While I had found a range of studies around RGT in education in previous research enterprises, for this systematic scoping review I set those aside as [can’t remember the metaphor for something that should be found through those other searches]. Faculty Librarian suggested a series of expanding database searches focused initially in Australia and about Education, then extending out as far as initial parameters allow.

Figure 1: Database search sequence & strategy

I blended this with additional possible sources listed in the University of Sydney Library’s [Systematic Review Toolkit](https://library.sydney.edu.au/research/systematic-review/?section=before-you-start). In addition to database searching, a key website was also used to find relevant studies. < http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/repplus/> contains years of research by Gaines & Shaw, conceptual and technical experts and developers of the technical and statistical infrastructure on which computerised implementation of the Repertory Grid Technique can be deployed.

Before I finalised my research question, I checked for registration of systematic reviews at Joanna Briggs Institute at 1138 on Saturday 28 Sep. 19 using the search term “repertory”, and no titles were returned. I also checked PROSPERO at 1140 on the same day, identifying three registrations of systematic review in progress. Two were related to specific medical interventions, and the other to psychotherapy {Helena García-Mieres,  #68;Lauren Brown,  #67;Mozart Walz,  #66} so they are outside the scope of this review.

The search parameters I used were intended to be broad enough to find studies that did not always use the full terminology “repertory grid technique”, but defined enough so studies referring to software development tools “WebGrid”, reactive gas technique “RGT”, or reactive gas timing “RGT”. Parameters for each database differ slightly to reflect their conventions and constraints. Searches were performed in the order below.

__PSYCINFO returned a high number of results, which is expected because of RGT’s origin in Personal Construct Psychology. Two approaches were taken to reduce this set to more relevant studies. First, repeating the search without the ALL “repertory grid technique”, to exclude studies where it is used as background or in the bibliography. While the second search still returned over 900 results, a manual review was done to identify those in educational contexts, OR by authors of previously identified key works [eg Markus Heckmann].__

With JSTOR, in contrast, only 10% of articles have abstracts, so the full text search was important, even though it returned 266 different works (and it’s very painful to export from JSTOR so I’d rather get them all out now). While Web of Science does allow refinement by category, as there are only 165 papers returned from the search of 71,985,608 so I will manually check those as there appears to be only 1 or two in each category so it would take me more time to do all those checkboxes (see JSTOR above :-\).

__Known issue with Scopus 30/9 where "We have identified an issue which means that some sources will face delays in new issues being added to Scopus. We apologize for any inconvenience and will share updates via Twitter (@Scopus) and via the Scopus blog here" (no info about which sources or delay on blog, just watch blog or @scopus for updates).__ Because it returned so many results, used limiters to include only social sciences, psychology, arts, decision science, neuroscience, multidisciplinary and undefined. Full details are at /Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Documents/0_Chapters-see GitHub-repgrid/300_method/refining-scopus.docx

The subject filter in ProQuest was not suitable for refinement as categories do not reflect my differentiation (eg studies, humans etc.). A high proportion of these results were in theses, so I refined the search to search only the title and abstract, because I wanted only studies in which the technique was foregrounded as they would be the most useful.

As the Cochrane Library search only returned 17 references they were manually checked.

As I didn’t have a PRO TRIP subscription, I manually copied and pasted the web results into Excel for checking prior to setting up a RIS in EN for them.

Epistemonikos is also focused on health and clinical psychology.

The subject databases accessed are focused more on Randomised Control Trials, so additional searches across grey literature are also relevant. Substantial bodies of work are available from the authors of the WebGrid RepGrid analysis software (Shaw and Gaines, 2018), as seen at Table N.

All results for each search set are set out at /Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Data/Document-Reviews

All PDF and Microsoft Word document files were downloaded from each web page. Folder contents were saved as text and compared with the links in each web page to identify duplicates or non-document files. One HTML page was saved as PDF and the embedded movie converted to current MP4 standards; two duplicates were removed.

I created a specific EndNote library for each search set of documents, attaching full-text to each bibliographic record. This ensured that as iterative refinement of protocol appropriate to scoping reviews {Peters, 2015 #5} occurred, the previous document sets could be re-examined in this light.

To create a sense of narrative for myself in the process, I began by reviewing the first document related to Repertory Grid Technique in Education, Milded G. Shaw's thesis "On becoming a personal scientist: interactive computer programs for developing personal models of the world" {Shaw, 1978 #194}. The Literature Review chapter sets out how this foundation informed a wide range of activities across teaching and research which are relevant to this study and beyond. (for my own notes, my Summary is at ../../Summaries/Shaw. recognised the tensions inherent in the need for educational contexts to connect personally meaningful concepts with established traditions and.docx).

Following the thesis, I download and reviewed all documents from the RepPlus website <https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/repplus/>. I created a matching bibliographic record for each downloaded file and attached the relevant PDF (about 12 minutes each for 196 documents). While, as said above, the principal statistical and technical infrastructure around the computerised implementation of RGT was developed by Mildred G Shaw, she and her colleague at SERN Brian Gaines wrote so much together and cited each other frequently, it was important to go through all their joint and individual publications rather than just hers.

Where there were discrepancies in publication titles, years or provenance between my record and the citation at http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/reports/, the  information available in the document itself was was used.

After double checking all documents, I recorded the subset each record was in on the RepPlus site (for example, "Education and Learning" or "Modelling Psychological and  Social Systems") , although they are quite loosely construed and should not be considered prescriptive in my opinion. The content of the website itself (Home page, History page) was not a part of this standalone review.

## epistemonikos
As the body of work from Shaw and Gaines was substantial, I elected to test the MAXQDA import with a smaller document set until my workflow was established. I selected the epistemonikos output as it had a small number of files but more than one. In EN, I checked all abstracts were in place and attached full-text where available. I renamed all attachments to author-date-title format as this is the document title that will display in MAXQDA and consistency is helpful, and with the understanding that the next import will bring a substantial number of documents in with identical authors and years it is necessary to tell one from another easily. After saving these as a new Library and exporting the file data as .RIS, I opened MAXQDA2020 and used the EndNote import function to select the .RIS, then the .ENL, to import both the "References" and References> Attachments. I moved the PDFs (Attachments) into the RIS (References) folder which I retitled epistemonikos.

From a surface perspective, all the article titles are about people in some kind of therapeutic engagement. For me, this is what I categorise as "clinical". I then reviewed each articles further in 2020 to see which terms I should exclude from the next phase of search strategy. At the same time, I had the opportunity to contribute to my broader Literature Review by using this sample data set to also find terms to exclude from data analysis. As the two sets of terms were likely to be substantially similar, I chose a data-driven approach to identifying terms within this set of records which could be useful to limit results in future searches and provide cleaner data for analysis.

I first created individual word clouds and word frequency tables for each document in the epistemonikos project to identify terms were not relevant to this review. To reduce clutter in these reports, it is customary to use a list of "stop" words not relevant to the researchers analytical frame.

MAXQDA2020 offers one set of pre-configured stop list words in English, principally "definite and indefinite articles, conjunctions, or numerals". {VERBI Software, 2019 #7616}. Even though these lists had been uploaded, the clouds and tables showed that several variations were still included. To remedy this, I used the application's interface to manually add words already established as stop words (for example, "a", "the" and "did") to the stop list. This is appropriate to use for my review, but is not adequate to exclude the range of clinical or therapeutic contexts which are not relevant to higher education learning, teaching and research, particularly for databases with large output sets such as PSYCHINFO.

Once I had uploaded the additional stop word list to MAXQDA2020, I re-ran the word frequency analysis to check that the result foregrounded more relevant terms, such as "self", "group", and "cognitive". While these terms may be found in a clinical context, they are also potentially relevant to educational research and could not be excluded at this stage of the review.

My next step was to work through the frequency table line by line, and develop a custom stop list based on my research aim - to provide a benchmark of how RepGrid has been operationalised in education, preferably higher education. By the 100th row of the frequency output, variations on the previous terms were frequent and I concluded it was likely I had reached saturation of these terms, at least for this data set.

After reviewing these 100 terms, I then broke them down into categories, and determined those that may be too relevant to exclude. The data from this is at Table N.

The complete output of word clouds, frequency analysis and pre- and post- stop lists from this stage is at /Users/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/updated-stoplist-analysis.xlsx. These will be used to reduce the quantity of results in other searches.

The current stop list is at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c17n3w17be32tsn/AACtCqpK-0JBpz4yomBFzkSla?dl=0.

The next step was to search for anything in the set that was relevant to my research aim. The stop word lists are not applicable to the Lexical Search function in MAXQDA, so I used the list to develop a search strategy for exclusion, while looking for the terms "educa*" (to avoid finding variations of reduc*), and "repgrid" or "repertory" or "grid". This search was later slightly modified, as "grid"   explained below. After modification, the lexical search is at Table N.

| Lexical search parameters |                |

After running the search, I then reviewed the displayed results, which include the full sentence in which the term is found. I coded the abstract of each result that was not relevant to this research report as NO (or enough  text to see why it was not included if there was no abstract).

In the epistemonikos set, none of the four retrieved results were in a higher education settting.

## Cochrane Library

Cochrane Library search returned 16 Trials and one Protocol.
Using the method above, none of these results were in the scope of this review. However, this stage highlighted the need to add variations of "counselling" to the search strategy exclusions.

## A+ database

With the initial approach bedded down, I commenced the database searches in the order recommended by the Faculty Librarian. An important consideration for these larger datasets is the absence of an associated full-text. While EndNote has a feature to access full-text from the university Library, system issues prevented this from being usable. I address this in this review by:

1. If an abstract is available, search the abstract
1. If an abstract is not available, exclude the document only if the title includes a word in the exclusion list
1. If not excluded, locate and manually download a full text version for review and coding.

The next database output for review was the APlus database, which focuses on education research in  Australian settings, this was a useful opportunity to begin a more nuanced coding regime around learning, teaching and research.

Returning to my defined scope of RepGrid in Higher Education, I narrowed my search strategy slightly with the aim of reducing irrelevant results within 2020:

educa* (avoiding the reduce trap) AND "repgrid" OR "repertory grid" BUT NOT words in the clinical stop list OR child OR children. Screen shot  at /Volumes/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/APlus-search_strategy.png

From the initial 76 documents found in the database search, my lexical search returned 55 documents containing the search terms.  A manual review of these 55 documents showed that the coding scheme could be expanded to include the setting (for example, school education versus post-school education), epistemic activities (for example, team decision-making and conceptual mapping) (for a broader discussion of what comprises epistemic activities please see the Literature Review chapter), and if used as a survey tool, the topic of the survey (for example, relationships or personal characteristics). Where the focus was at a more abstracted level (for example, interdisciplinarity or intercultural facilitation), that was coded on a case-by-case basis.

/Volumes/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Data/example-of-subcode-summary-aplus.png

While found containing the search term educa*, neither research nor instruction was necessarily  about education, and while those studies have fed into the Literature Review chapter, they are excluded from the results of this review. The Lit Review also discuses the difference between "metacognition" and "reflection" in the context of Higher Education. In the meantime, it's all coded as metacognition.

I coded the SPERA as School Ed because it is likely that "remote" as opposed to "online" means school as opposed to Higher Ed.

I have combined beliefs with experiences and perceptions, as they are toward the inner and less intentional end of a continuum, with practice combined with thinking and behaviour at the more external and more intentional end.

Figure 1 shows an example of coding applied from the Setting, Research and Something Else categories. This document does meet the criteria for inclusion in the review.

/Volumes/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Analysis Files/code-assignment-example-APlus.png

Teacher Education has been separated into Professional Development (in-service) and Higher Education for the purposes of this review. While beyond the scope of this review, the body of Teacher Education is substantial, and I am considering whether to create a simple table of all Teacher Education, particularly where there's a research component.

I then reviewed the 21 documents not found in the Lexical search, and found two records that met the criteria for inclusion but did have the term child/ren.  This exclusion had the unintended effect of excluding teacher education in higher education where this term was mentioned in the title or abstract.

While it is manageable to manually check this small number of documents for inclusion, the search strategy for PSYCHINFO will need to include these terms and then be coded depending on whether it is ALSO a Higher Education or PD/stakeholder/other setting. This will require a two stage process, set out below.

Of the 55 records identified by search, 25 met the inclusion criteria, plus two not initially identified. Of these, full text has not yet been located for 12. While pointing to full text is not necessary for doing a systematic scoping review, as many of the documents are more than 20 years old and are not available through our University Libraries, I consider it an affordance for users of this review, and consistent with my goal of establishing a "baseline" of data about Repertory Grid Technique in Higher Education. I also want them for my broader Literature Review.

## Shaw and/or Gaines at RepPlus

While I reviewed the RepPlus papers from Shaw and Gaines prior to re-reviewing the database outputs above, I reviewed them again after the minor changes to search strategy made above. I also considered whether to be as broad as:

Abstracts read thoroughly for alignment with parameters:
- educational setting (not clinical education, eg adherence to medication regimes)
AND
__- epistemic focus (knowledge construction or co-construction, metacognition, problem-solving/decision-making - that is a tough distinction, tacit knowledge elicitation)
OR
- collaboration focus (model-building, decision-making)
OR__
- research focus (educational researchers using repgrid as a survey instrument) - here "educational" is the tricky bit, because what about transformed sound and other good papers like that.

or to omit the italicised documents from the SSR (but include them in my own LR) My conclusion is to not read closely enough to gain that depth of insight, except for my own Literature Review. Papers in scope are only Repertory Grid in and Higher Education- but the research angle is nuanced.

While with the A+ output all I had was abstracts, and some records lacked those, I have all the full papers from RepPlus. This allowed searching the full-text rather than the abstracts to more closely target relevant studies. I removed the terms child / children from the exclusion list with the aim of then searching that term and manually assigning a code.

 During the test stages of my initial search, I noted  that several documents in this set may not use the term "repertory grid", but may use either the platform title "webgrid", or the title of one of the components, such as "PEGAUS", "FOCUS", or "SOCIOGRIDS".

 Adding relevant technical terms to the search params:
- ARGUS
- SOCIOGRIDS
- CORE
- MINUS
- PEGASUS
- SPACED
- FOCI
- FOCUS

Checking which excluded terms impacted the finding of relevant documents:

patient* (11 records)
medic* (2 records)
clinic* (2)
child* (2)

On closer review, those records tend to be large works which provide deep background to Repertory Grid Technique, which began in a therapeutic context. I decide to retain those words in the exclusion list and manually check for them in the unidentified record set.

Final search parameters are at Table N

Run updated search in the 196 PDFs, returning 46 documents.

Autocode all those with Autocode - ALL: educa* ANY: repertory grid repgrid ARGUS
SOCIO.
Activate those autocoded documents, then refining search as above:
Autocode - ANY: university graduate higher

Clear from the first document that it picked up the term "university" in the author institution. I don't think the refinement is helpful. Instead, activate those documents not found by the search, and search them for those terms.

Manually code those 46 results only around their relevance to this review. [ran overall documents including RIS, 52 results, coded for cross-check of additional 8 coded segments].

Of those 46, 13 refer explicitly to higher education settings. Of the six results that met the criteria for the first search but not the second, only one met the criteria,, and the full text of that document was already coded as HE.

##  ERIC

Previous adjustments should mean the search is now calibrated correctly. I won't separate PDF from RIS at this stage as I only have 2 PDFs. Ran Lex search with application names (eg FOCUS) and without excluding child/ren.

4 duplicates of the Buckley-Walker paper. Need to review full-text for several documents to check if HE or not. Criteria for exclusion: teacher ed or PD not in HE, vocational setting not related to HE, research setting not related to HE. Generic Adult Ed not in a HE setting. Surveys of teachers about their beliefs excluded if the setting not hE. Although surveys of teachers are coded teacher education so I might need to revisit that. Won't impact on the HE set. Tagging management for Ehssan.

Lots of work of using RepGrid for inter-rater assessment or criteria elaboration

duplicate avoidance process?
1. export all completed M- projects as sxls

2. experimenting with macro to highlight any value that is on any other sheet



What are the advantages of a ssr?

What do examples of SSR look like?



One limitation of scoping reviews is that they do not provide an exhaustive and formal appraisal of evidence across the body of research {Arksey, 2005 #7}. This is a significant issue for health and medical research with randomised and controlled trials, but less problematic for this study, as any evaluative methods are likely to be highly variable and context-dependent. The systematic process of scoping is likely to be beneficial to our understanding of those evaluative methods and the situations in which they are found.

Persistent problems occurred with searching caused by cookie and adblocker issues. It was difficult to have effective privacy settings as well as save searches and set alerts. That meant I had to repeat several searches from the beginning, as what ever the problem was would only become clear when I tried to either save or set a search alert or export search results. The university Library system is also incompletely operational, with search results inconsistent and/or unavailable for 1475 of the 2395 found results.

Why?

RepGrid is not effectively operationalised {McKellar, 2014 #1} in educational contexts where it could be of value.

The search should be inclusive {McKellar, 2014 #1}








Remember to go back later on an merge the semi-dup RIS variables.



So I'm bringing the files into 2020 for this scoping review because it allows me to use machine analysis as well as my own views to identify relevant materials.
