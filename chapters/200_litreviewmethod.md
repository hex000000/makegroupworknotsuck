# Methodology
## Systematic scoping review

I chose the systematic scoping review as a methodological approach with the aim of providing a “baseline” for research on Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) at this point in time. A true systematic review requires multiple researchers, often working across institutions, thus unsuitable for a single PhD candidate. Even scoping reviews are sometimes done by multiple researchers, particularly if the topic has a large literature base.

Before deciding on this methodology I did some preliminary searches to check that it was viable, and discussed the approach at length and in-person with our Faculty Librarian (to whom I am very grateful).

The first part of my approach is to use a Qualitative Data Analysis System (MAXQDA) to describe how a systematic scoping review is conducted. However, I kept the previous coding scheme in MAXQDA because it took sooooo long to create and I don’t know how different my new one will be. I also created an empty EndNote Library to ensure that each addition to the review has been properly identified within the search protocol. The initial papers telling me how to do the scoping review were given to me by the Librarian and I use them here to explain how this review type is appropriate to the thesis apart from the single/multiple researcher issue.

There are many types of structured literature reviews, and while the methodology for full systematic literature reviews is well established in many fields, less rigorous methods are not as well-defined {Arksey, 2005 #7}. The ‘scoping’ approach is purposeful in this study, as I aim to review the broad range of research on using RGT in education, summarising and disseminating methods for pedagogical and research implementation, and identifying gaps in the research which could be usefully addressed. However, where scoping reviews may not traditionally measure the success of the studies it finds {Arksey, 2005 #7}, in this research I will foreground case studies which have demonstrated results and use them as models for resource development.

Following the framework suggested by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), I use a staged approach to develop a research question and protocol for finding relevant studies, summarising findings, then reporting the results. I might adapt the Arksey idea of consultation in the review process to consultation about which pedagogical models and resources would be most helpful. As an important feature of systematic scoping reviews is replicability, the process I used is set out in rigorous transparency in this chapter.

## Identifying the research question
While the broad research question has been established as “How is Repertory Grid Technique used in higher education?”, Arksey and O’Malley (2005) suggest beginning by considering which aspects of the question are most important to develop a search strategy. “Repertory Grid Technique” is unambiguous conceptually and the most important feature.

However, it might be described using different phraseology, for example, RepGrid, and that must be clear in the search parameters. “Education” is potentially more difficult, as it is a very broad field ranging from 0-5 childhood right through to professional education. The target audience for this study is higher education students, instructors and researchers, which might not be specified in accessible search fields, requiring closer reading to establish. This is consistent with Arksey and O’Malley (2005) description of the process of scoping reviews as iterative and reflexive while at the same time comprehensive and documented in detail. While {Booth, 2019 #2} talks to the difficulty of iteration in a systematic way, and suggests that it is still possible to engage in a transparent manner.

{Booth, 2019 #2} realist view is based on six principles which align in many ways with those of Arksey & O'Malley (2005).    

## Finding relevant studies
While I had found a range of studies around RGT in education in previous research enterprises, for this systematic scoping review I set those aside as [can’t remember the metaphor for something that should be found through those other searches]. Faculty Librarian suggested a series of expanding database searches focused initially in Australia and about Education, then extending out as far as initial parameters allow.

Figure 1: Database search sequence & strategy

I blended this with additional possible sources listed in the University of Sydney Library’s [Systematic Review Toolkit](https://library.sydney.edu.au/research/systematic-review/?section=before-you-start). In addition to database searching, two key websites were also used to find relevant studies. < http://www.pcp-net.org/encyclopaedia/main.html> is a site dedicated to Personal Construct Psychology, the foundation for RGT, and < http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/repplus/> contains years of research by Gaines & Shaw, conceptual and technical experts. More later.

Before I finalised my research question, I checked for registration of systematic reviews at Joanna Briggs Institute at 1138 on Saturday 28 Sep. 19 using the search term “repertory”, and no titles were returned. I also checked PROSPERO at 1140 on the same day, identifying three registrations of systematic review in progress. Two were related to specific medical interventions, and the other to psychotherapy {Helena García-Mieres,  #68;Lauren Brown,  #67;Mozart Walz,  #66} so they are outside the scope of this review.

The search parameters I used were intended to be broad enough to find studies that did not always use the full terminology “repertory grid technique”, but defined enough so studies referring to software development tools “WebGrid”, reactive gas technique “RGT”, or reactive gas timing “RGT”. Parameters for each database differ slightly to reflect their conventions and constraints. Searches were performed in the order below.

PSYCINFO returned a high number of results, which is expected because of RGT’s origin in Personal Construct Psychology. Two approaches were taken to reduce this set to more relevant studies. First, repeating the search without the ALL “repertory grid technique”, to exclude studies where it is used as background or in the bibliography. While the second search still returned over 900 results, a manual review was done to identify those in educational contexts, OR by authors of previously identified key works [eg Markus Heckmann].

With JSTOR, in contrast, only 10% of articles have abstracts, so the full text search was important, even though it returned 266 different works (and it’s very painful to export from JSTOR so I’d rather get them all out now). While Web of Science does allow refinement by category, as there are only 165 papers returned from the search of 71,985,608so I will manually check those as there appears to be only 1 or two in each category so it would take me more time to do all those checkboxes (see JSTOR above :-\).

Known issue with Scopus 30/9 where We have identified an issue which means that some sources will face delays in new issues being added to Scopus. We apologize for any inconvenience and will share updates via Twitter (@Scopus) and via the Scopus blog here [no info about which sources or delay on blog, just watch blog or @scopus for updates]. Because it returned so many results, used limiters to include only social sciences, psychology, arts, decision science, neuroscience, multidisciplinary and undefined. Also need to keep track of articles suggested by recommended services eg Mendeley.

Subject filter in ProQuest not suitable for refinement as categories do not reflect my differentiation (eg studies, humans etc.). A high proportion of these results were in theses, so I refined the search to search only the title and abstract, because I wanted only studies in which the technique was foregrounded as they would be the most useful.

Made a mistake while re-doing Cochrane Library search, deleting the EN groups previously added but not the references. This will need to be addressed in the de-duplication process but as there are only 13/16 references this should be fine.

As I didn’t have a PRO TRIP subscription, I manually copied and pasted the web results into Excel for checking prior to setting up a RIS in EN for them.

Epistemonikos is also focused on health and clinical psychology.

The initial search phase results are at Table n.

The subject databases accessed are focused more on Randomised Control Trials, so additional searches across grey literature are also relevant. Substantial bodies of work are available from the authors of the WebGrid RepGrid analysis software (Shaw and Gaines, 2018), as seen at Table N.

All PDF and Microsoft Word document files were downloaded from each web page. Folder contents were saved as text and compared with the links in each web page to identify duplicates or non-document files. One HTML page was saved as PDF and the embedded movie converted to current MP4 standards; two duplicates were removed.

I decided to read the Thesis first, after I convert it to text and pull it into MAXQDA. Then coded and summarised in ../../Summaries/Shaw recognised the tensions inherent in the need for educational contexts to connect personally meaningful concepts with established traditions and.docx.


I created a separate EN Library for these papers as they were likely to be foundational to the journal articles which would follow. I attempted to import the word documents to Mendeley to automatically attach citation data but that didn’t work for Boose. It worked slightly better for the Reports documents as they were mostly PDF. But then I needed to go through each document and review it. But then EN wouldn’t import the .xml or the .ris. So in the end I did this after I read Mildred’s thesis.
196 references were imported with Attachments. Started checking ID at 1523 25102019. Finished 24 by 1741. Break. Starting again at 2058 29102019. Several pathnames were incorrect in the links but could be resolved by inferring the missing path component/s. BEd at 2248 - rate of about 10 per hour. 0111 about 100 to do, do ten and then chore, then ten...

Continuing to progress at a rate of about 1 every 12 minutes. Once compared with master list, and double-checked against their web pages. I searched the text for the word "grid" to establish whether Repertory Grid was mentioned. When "grid" was found, I reviewed the context, removing articles where the word stem was not in relation to repgrid or webgrid (for example, grid computing). finished around 1230 Saturday 0211.

The list didn't match up smoothly because the Mendeley import assigned incorrect citation data to many of the records. I manually went through the list of files downloaded from the gaines site and updated the data at the same time that I pasted the abstracts into the spreadsheet and searched for RepGrid references in text. There were still several "rows" missing, so back to triple-check against the gaines site and the downloaded file lists.
Where there were discrepancies in publication titles, years or provenance, first preference was given to information within the document itself. The fallback then was to http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/reports/.

Because they wrote so much together and cited each other frequently, it was important to go through all their joint and individual publications at the calgary reports page.

So after checking that everything on the reports page was in EndNote, I double checked that they were the right year, and removed accidental duplicates. I recorded the subset each record was in on the Gaines site, although they became more loosely construed over time and should not be considered prescriptive in my opinion.

Resolved modelling & supporting is a separate document which should be listed on page instead of duplicate title & abstract.

Cross check of 198 records complete.
Now check that I have them in the right buckets
bucket check done, there are 199 records in EN documented on the Excel sheet.

Spreadsheet of all Documents reviewed is at
T-and-B-Gaines-Shaw.xlsm. Of 197 documents located at /reports, 69 mention the Repertory Grid Technique. An EN Library of those 69 is at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/odh50wf5iapxj6t/AABeaZbFjGcvkh3c6A4T-DkXa?dl=0

Do I need to set out how I developed coding schemata? Probably not so relevant here. Decided to use my skeleton outline to being with. Then working from oldest work forwards.

-- while reviewing the documents to see which mentioned RepGrid/WebGrid, I noted in EndNote those that are either definitely, or may be, relevant to my studies. These occupy their own EN Libraries now and need to be brought into MAXDA. I have started coding in the 2018 version, and now need to convert my project to 2020 and set up a workflow with my new plan to use the iMac as main home machine, and laptop connected to large monitor in the Lab. '

Installing M2020 now, after making sure copy of most recent project is in Dropbox. It looks like the 2020 can leave files in their original EN folder location, so I will do some testing with the SSR method files, exporting them to a new EN folder and linking to 2020. I'm going to re-import the EN files, no, that's not a good idea because I'll have to keep updating the location each time I move computers. So I'll have to keep the EN files in Dropbox. BUT, most of the files are linked to a local EN library PDF folder. FAAAAAAAArk.

Looks like I'm going to have to either EN them on Dropbox or keep bundling them for transfer between computers. I'm going to go with option B, and have the EN Libraries in Dropbox as a backup / share only. BIG DECISION!

So even though the pathname is correct - no it isn't, because as a user here I am j. I should create my own login on this Mac. First I need to make sure the applications folder is top level. Yep, looks like it. Let's try now.

OK slight issue with not running multiple versions of Dropbox, tempted to try an Automator script but don't want to stuff up Jay's db so no. New version of file locations spreadsheet and the workflow will be:

1. Do EN on local machine, then copy library in named folder to /Volumes/eb/Dropbox/MAXQDA-Ex/MAXQDA_Exchange. From there, copy to local folder of next computer.
2. Do 2020 on local machine, then copy folder to the same Exchange folder for copying to local machine but this might not work depending on location of Externals. How can I do this most seamlessly? First see if I can reconnect the method PDFs in the 2020 project and then work backwards First restoring folder name that I had changed for consistency. Then  open the 2020 project. Then drag & drop PDFs missing from their EN folder, because this path should stay table if I copy from Applications folder between Macs. so I changed the folder name (but not library name) back again for consistency. same PDF trick for showing all the files simultaneously. Drag and drop does not replace file. Neither does import. Both look like they work but no effect. While I can't create a real dropnbox folder, I'll try a fake one.

That worked. Now I am left with one folder that points to one location for externals, and the other folders to a different location. And of course I have lots of coded sections in both. And if I bring them all in, they'll go out to a single externals folder instead of staying in their EN PDF folder which is where I'd like to keep them. So I will just have to suck it up with Arksey et al. until I have time to re-do the whole thing from EN, whch might not work the same way in 2020 as it did in 2018.

Now I have to stabilise the files across all the locations. Decided I would do an EN_exchange folder and the subfolder with current version of all files. Will stick with this, as Applications at top level on both Macs should be a stable location (I Hope). so basic structure is that for each of EN and 2020, there is a Folder in the applications folder of each Mac, containing:
1. the application
2. necessary support files
3. a sub-folder with option-f extension containing current project files.
At the moment, the 2020 folder has PDFs that shouldn't be there. I will use the next import from EN to test the viability of ENfolder location ongoing.

pdf NUMBERs in 2020 FOLDER inconsistent, leave until later as idea is no pdffs.

OK all consistent across MB, iM & Exchange folder.

Now will try new 2020 import from EN for a small set of files. Saved a backup of T&B in versions folder first.

New Library -Converted

Selected epistemonikos as it had a small number of files but more than one.
- Check that all abstracts are in place
- Find full text
- Rename attachments author-date-titles
- copy to new library (EN-epistemonikos.enl)
- export RIS
- import to 2020. I didn't check the 'external' checkbox, so will they import to 2020 and do they just end up loose in the folder? They come in in two new folders "references" and references> attachments. I moved the PDFs into the RIS folder which I retitled epistemonikos.

The links work!

but now all my Gaines/Shaw are disconnected... So I reckon I'll bring them in again to connect them properly.Only one document is really heavily marked up so I'll leave that in the original location and reimport all the others.

Problems with the rdb and tdb folders in EN being protected, stops me saving converted updated library. reopened on laptop, exported, now will try to transfer between comptuers. But 40 references and 56 PDFs? OK wait until tomorrow and try again.

 Re-exported libraries and no problems to exchange folder. Now re-import to 2020. The previous attempt has imported all the PDFs to an Externals folder 2020 created in Documents. Small Epistemonikos import went fine, but realise there is no way I can keep extenrals in their original location. The two Shaw papers I've marked up I need to find a creative way around, maybe through Merge?
 original PDF location snapshot. Now stuff is all over the place - in the Document folder and in the Applications folder. No rationale that I can see.

 OK now I have embedded all the PDFs, and then made them all externals to the Blexternals folder. But Did It Work?

 Total of 25 PDFs - how mnay in 2020? so it imported multiples linked to the dups. Have decided to start with a clean improt then merge and see what happens. Saving a copy of 2020 file. OK method done and it seems to be going OK.
 Now yes and maybe.
 MyYes and MyMaybe are subsets of all the papers reviewed for RepGrid/WebGrid.

 Well it just kept creating externals so I have put a support request in.

The next set of files to export from EN should be a small set, with procedure replicable as part of the SSR.


Then there are the books. I focused on the most recent volume of the most cited? Work by Fransella, Bay & Bannister.

One limitation of scoping reviews is that they do not provide an exhaustive and formal appraisal of evidence across the body of research {Arksey, 2005 #7}. This is a significant issue for health and medical research with randomised and controlled trials, but less problematic for this study, as any evaluative methods are likely to be highly variable and context-dependent. The systematic process of scoping is likely to be beneficial to our understanding of those evaluative methods and the situations in which they are found.

Persistent problems occurred with searching caused by cookie and adblocker issues. It was difficult to have effective privacy settings as well as save searches and set alerts. That meant I had to repeat several searches from the beginning, as what ever the problem was would only become clear when I tried to either save or set a search alert or export search results.

Now I am waiting for tech help, work on reducing the sets of files down to relevance.

First set, epistemonikos because the smallest, so a good way to

OK, have an idea to keep the PDFs in place. What about unchecking the "store in folder for external files"?

OK, so now it is leaving the PDFsin EN, which isn't bad, but it does mean they're inside the file, which IS bad. So there is nO way to keep then in EN. So now, will export to Blexternals.

Select PDFs in list, then Exernal Files > Store documents in folder for external files. But they are already "external files", in the EN location. I think it's the Saving As that is embedding the files.YES!!!! THAT'S THE PROBLEM!!!!!

I've sorted that out :-|

So now i have to gently replace the Arksey paper somehow.
Used  Teamwork> Teamwork Export: Data Exchange file write to create an exchange file with the two documents (RIS & PDF).
Opened M-Method 2020 and then...  Teamwork> Teamwork Import: reading from Exchange file data. It asked whether I wanted to import the RIS as new, so uncheck that box, andit looks like it recognises the PDFas the name is identical.

With heart in mouth, I click Next, it confirms 22 codes and 8 coded segments. Next. Overwrite existing segment boundaries with imported ones? yes. Other options are inner bounds, outer bounds and keep existing. 52 variables? not sure that I might want to delete those. Import.

Automatically creates a backup prior to Merge.

YEAH BABY!!! I've nailed it. So considerations:

a. Saving a copy duplicates the PDFs internally
b. When I want to bring in a new RIS containing previously coded PDFs, I can use the Export / Import to retain the coding.

OK.

Always start with an empty project file saved as the name of the import you're about to do so the PDFs don't get duplicated. Because I've been working on a version that included the original RIS DUMMY field.

Two more Shaw to come in, coded before I did the systematic thing, definitely in the YES set. Interactive came through alright, might need to adjust the thesis filename. Tried this, didn't automatically find target so manually set a target.

summary: save project as makes all files internal

epistemoff.2020.

From a surface perspective, all the articles are about people in some kind of therapeutic engagement. For me, this is what i categorise as "clinical". I'm reviewing these articles further in 2020 to see which terms I should exclude from the next phase of search strategy.

While 2020 can't do Word Clouds from PDFs, you can select the PDF text and create a document from it, which can then be turned into a word cloud.

So systematically going through epistemonikos... Some PDFs are not textable. What if I modify the original pDF? Doesn't work. So need to run OCR on everything before import. Already done with CPSC. Only a couple of epistemonikos are images.

All text captured from article individually, then individual word clouds, qord frequencies and a consoldiated version to test stoplist words and exclusions. Current stoplist is at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c17n3w17be32tsn/AACtCqpK-0JBpz4yomBFzkSla?dl=0.

I did have a set of gowords from prewious studies but I think i need to generate a research-led pne.
By row 100 in the all-epistemoniks the terms were starting to repeat with minor variations. New tab in spreadsheet https://www.dropbox.com/s/3mcz0w21l0ttvex/updated-stoplist-analysis.xlsx?dl=0 with discussion.

New stoplists uploaded: PCP-sometimes.txt
other-1118.txt
numbers.txt
clinical.txt

These can be used to reduce quantity of results in other searches.
Now another word cloud of the epistemonikos.
Showed that the stop lists didn't necessarily stop the words. So now I will go through and manually remove them from the frequ dialog in 2020. After manually adding those identified to the stop list, another frequency list and word cloud were created. Searching the frequency list for "education" returned five results - I need to output these with commentary tomorrow :-)

I am going to use 2020 to analyse those five results as a test base for the next set of records. I have already saved all the epistemonikos PDFs as text to do the word cloud and stop word analysis.

## Search Procedure:
1. Select all the documents
1. Click the magnifying glass. Nup.
1. Enter educat* (2020 searches for it appearing anywhere within the word). That didn't do anything.
Now trying the "Lexical Search" function from the Analysis tab.
Searched for "educat".
18 results. 9 in the text documents, and 9 in the PDFs. So I only have to search the PDFs, which will make it easier to contextualise the reference.

well, it's not a perfect duplication - they are referrig to the same passsages in the same work, but the PDF version provides a longer context string - that may be a setting: /Volumes/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Documents/0_Chapters-see GitHub-repgrid/images/Screen Shot 2019-11-21 at 6.31.05 pm.png.

For now, I select the PDF documents and activate them then run search in activated documents only. I now just have 9.
Clicking the blue lines next to the search results takes you to that place in the document.
I reviewed each instance o the search string and recorded results in an excel table that I need to convert for here: /Volumes/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Data/Document-Reviews/M-epistemonikios-results.xlsx

I also selected all the documents and Auto-Coded them as NO-clinical, with the segments including one sentence before and one after (a setting in the AutoCode dialogue).

OK
Now I need to reduce the next batch of files using the stoplists, and search using that process.

Next, the Cochrane Library things & protocol.

1. Check abstracts and full texts are in EN T&B Library before exporting sub-library.
2. Export .ris from sub-library into properly named folder

1. Do I need to put them in 2020? it's clear from titles and abstracts they're all clinical except one which is about satiety.

Will put them in and re-think. One PDF wobbly, one not found, two duplicates. Downloaded a related study just for interest on a Quality of Life modelling that is done with RepGrid.

1. Open empty 2020 project, and save as <name matching EN export>.

1. Import bibliographic data - go to EN option and select folder and .RIS, choose import option but not the store option
1. Search educa (to disambiguate from reduc•)

Again, none suitable, but this is too slow.

Realised I should turn my stop lists into global stop lists. Also clear that counselling should be added to the list - added them to the clinical list. I'll add it to the blank sp it will apply to future 2020 projects.

Now reviewing is going to get harder, so I have to come up with some kind of search strategy. Biggest issue is going to be getting the full-text of thousands of papers.

What are my aims? to provide   benchmark of how RepGrid has been operationalised in education, preferably higher education. This is a descriptive endeavour, with more depth and synthesis of those studies found in HE in my complete Literature Revie.

OK. Next run is A+ Education. What's your plan? No point bringing into 2020 without th PDFS.
Realise I also need to add the multiple software packages & webpages at some point.
Not a single full-text found.

Narrow the search strategy.
educa* (avoiding the reduce trap) AND "repgrid" OR "repertory grid" BUT NOT words in the clinical stoplist OR child OR children. Screen snot  at /Volumes/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/APlus-search_strategy.png

Result is 55 hits in 55 documents (remembering I only have abstracts here). Manual review of the 55 and then I'll have to find the PDFs of those that fit the parameters.

What are the parameters? Used in what Lina would call an epistemic activity (see notes) in research and practice conducted in higher education. (And these studies will be mostly Autralian because Aplus).

This time instead of exporting before I code them and manually noting, I will code first and then export.

Abstracts read thoroughly for alignment with parameters:
- educational setting (not clinical education, eg adherence to medication regimes)
AND
- epistemic focus (knowledge construction or co-construction, metacognition, problem-solving/decision-making - that is a tough distinction, tacit knowledge elicitation)
OR
- collaboration focus (model-building, decision-making)
OR
- research focus (educational researchers using repgrid as a survey instrument) - here "educational" is the tricky bit, because what about transformed sound and other good papers like that. Maybe it's a more nuanced breakdown into things that are hard to research with traditional instruments. So have a category for all those other non-clinical/psych/counselling research which is excluded, and another for other types of research, maybe separate out marketing later, then look within the other papers at types of research which have used the grid where other things don't work.

so does that mean I should look at those tags specifically? go back and look at the studies you've coded so far.

I need two levels of coding again, like with the Shaw & Gaines papers. One level solely for he SSR, and another for me. Do mine on the second pass after first chunking them in or out.

Coding at this time ignores relevance to me, just inclusion or not. Will re-code those already done as follows and update as we go.

Have made some changes to the code tree which I will update every now and again. Decided I would not separate TAFE and Higher Ed settings as there are enough common features - especially about survey research rather than teaching. Schools coded as such hen referred to as "school" in Abstract or keywords, Unsure codes will check to confirm.
Consider having some kind of Literacy code along with Inters. Maybe that can come out of text analysis.
OK realise I need to include in the survey section what the survey was about. Going back over the ten papers  now.

Need to go back and refine all those "student" teachers differently to non pre-service? Text analysis should help with that. Maybe just code them also as HE.

I think I also need to go back to tease out the 'classroom teaching' as there are a lot of those. Also need to add who was surveyed, teachers, students, stakeholders? No, HE means students unless it's also Teacher Ed.
I have put beliefs in with experiences and perceptions.
practice goes in with behaviour but might change code name
code table updated in /Applications/MAXQDA/MAXQDAƒ/APlus-code-plus-legacy.xlsx and main sheet at https://www.dropbox.com/s/1eiygm8w2ky89se/Termites-and-Butterflies.xlsm?dl=0

so what is my search plan, given the coding so far... see the T&B spreadhseet logic & strategy tabs

Narrow the search strategy.
educa* (avoiding the reduce trap) AND "repgrid" OR "repertory grid" BUT NOT words in the clinical stoplist OR child OR children. Screen snot  at /Volumes/eb/Dropbox/Documents/-Fed/Termites-and-Butterflies/Command Files/APlus-search_strategy.png

Re-run all prior searches to see if they fit, then re-code.
Identify new codes required.
Export codes from 2020, remove all the auto-assigned ones, keep only the Tools/Setting/Epistemic/Research/Something Else categories for now. Will see what coding S&G adds to this set.

1. Gaines & Shaw from RepPlus site - all 197 of them :-| Yess and Maybes already in, adding the Nos now. Should I use the same strategy? Run and test. Particularly beccause there are mostly pre-1980s conference papers so abstracts might be short. In A+, all I had was abstracts. I have all the full papers from G&S. I will search the papers rather than abstracts> Or do both and see what the difference is.

32 hits in 32 documents and 3 document groups.
It searched both abstracts and PDFs. The 32 documents are listed in the RepPlus-searched tab of T&B.

Repeat trying RIS only: 6 Results'
Repeat PDF only expect 32 results - 26 hits 26 docs 3 groups.
Overlap?
Coped and pasted into sheet and then realised that the RIS only have author-year and not the document title. So a manual check of the PDF to which the RIS is linked. Activated all the RIS, repeat search, only one overlap. Probably stoplist kicking in.
Now manual check of those identified, and not identified, so see if search is accurate enough. Repat searches and make a set of each RIS, PDF and NotID.
Coded
- Lex-search-PDFs
- Lex-search-RIS

"Document variables, which display how often a code exists (their source is acknowledged as “code”) can be transformed into a binary variable by clicking on the  “COnvert to boolean variable” button. After it is transformed the variable will not show, how often a code has been assigned in the document, but if it has been assigned in this document or not."

Selected codes, right-click and   "Transform to document variable".
A column is added for each in the Data Editor window, with the number of codings as an integer.
In the Document Variables List, click the Categorical checkbox.
Click the Convert to Boolean button
Mixed Methods Tab, Activate documents by Variables
Conditions Lex-search-RIS=0 AND Lex-search-RIS=0 -> Creates a saved set
Also found on the Code More.. contextual menu an Invert Activation option.

But now activated, how do I apply a code to them?
Can I do it programmatically through a variable?
Repeat previous actions with Lex-search-NO
Can't use normal coding because no text selected in the Documents

In Data Editor for Document Variables, I can click each of the Lex codes in turn to sort by code. Clicking RIS, then PDF, then NO means that all the documents with the first two codes are at the top/bottom of the list. Can't also show only Activated documents.

Can't select multiple documents. Can't input as in the click the NO box manually. I think I will jsut have to leave it as a set for now. The purpose is only to double check the search strategy.

What is my purpose?  To see if all the documents that I want to find were found. So I need to go through all those that didn't make the cut to see any parameters I need to change. A new code for those called Lex-MISS

eek! working in backup and know I can't save as... Repeat.

OK have the set re-created, now will work through all uncoded documents searching for educ* in both abstract and PDF. All documents that "should" have been picked up will be coded with Lex-MISS. Sorted by name because sometimes that turns out to be helpful. Immediately helpful because at least the Folder (which contains both RIS and PDF) and author / year are easy to compare.

Start 20191128 20:20
Tried Export Components to Project Files produced a detailed xlsx - I wanted the document titles to keep a record as I checked. Sheet "Coded Segments" column C contained the Code, separating those in the "Other" folder from the Lex-search files. This was accidental but useful.

 Problem was that when I filtered the documents to only show "other", I couldn't then subtotal them on the same page. Remove subtotoals.aha! remembered there's a conditional formatting that colours duplicates. then can I sort by colour? Way too much data, slow to manipulate. Can I export Sets as part of the document system? Nope, not included in the xport/. OK, links export should pick up one document per PDF if I get links just for th ePDFs. Realise it's easier to split into PDF not found and RIS not found, RIS will have extra links like URLs in them.

 Go back to Data Editor - all documents. click by hand NO on everything that's not PDF or RIS. Then I want to repeat the search but without "Psychology" as a stop word and see if I get a comparable list. OK Exported variables out to Excel. Use filters to identify documents with 0 in RIS or PDF variable and add a 1 into NO. Tested and 26 found with 1 in PDF and 6 in RIS so correct set. SORT so sselection is easier. Reimported. It added some new RIS-specific fields, but looks like it worked to set NO to 1. I changed he variable name to indicate that it denotes those works not found by the first pass of searching.

 Now I will re-run the search without psychology in the stop words. It's not there already!

Difficult to know what's ruling it out so I am going to hand check all the NOTIDd and code them, Keeping an eye on what the stoppers are, or whether it's accurate.
I can code with MISS those that should have been found and run a lexical analysis on them.
I can code with anothe NO those that were rightly ignored.
Then I can compare with the Variables-Mod sheet if I think I've missed anything.

When NO coding, selecting enough of the document to make it clear why not.
If MISS and NO together, means should have been picked up for the term but is not relevant to education context.

Decided the feedback trainer papers that are technical are not included. Many of the Gaines papers were about training feedback systems to train control techs, or generally about the usefulness of computers in Ed. Not RepGrid.Mostly also perceptual motor skills, can group by that on another pass. "human controller" search should get all these.human adapive controller, feedback training, learning machine,

Realised that the MISSs so far have been Ed but not RepGrid. Reclassify NO to No RepGrid no Ed aand miss to only those with both.

Coding modelling even if no RepGrid for post-review.

(Gaines-1991-Between neuron, culture and logic_, P. 0: 107)

at Library today thinking I should apply same search strategies to books & book chapters. how can I get all those stop words into my library search? I'll paste them in one by one. Can only have four paramters. test which are the most effective. With frist four terms, >8000 results.

Limiters are definitely not working, chose sixth down in list at random and a keyword is psychotherapy, which should have been caught by my psycho* NOT. Try psychotherapy in full. It is still in the list. Updated search parameters from Any Field to Subject. No effect.

OK new approach is all those, plus filter subject to only include Repertory Grid Technique, Repertory Grid, Education, 
Repertory Grid Method, Higher Education. only 2943 results, but still including psychotherapy results. Will have to filter by keyword in 2020 using stopwords there. How doI get the ris out of the Library?

Part of what will determine if they're in scope is if they're in an education/research-focused book/journal. Realised the search was returning journal articles, so I reduced it to books and book chapters. 41 results.https://sydney.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?query=any,contains,%22repertory%20grid%22,OR&query=any,contains,repgrid,AND&query=sub,contains,education,NOT&query=sub,contains,patient*,NOT&query=sub,contains,psychotherapy,NOT&query=sub,contains,clinic*,NOT&query=sub,contains,counsel*,AND&tab=Everything&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&sortby=date_a&vid=61USYD_INST:sydney&mfacet=topic,include,Repertory%20Grid%20Technique,1&mfacet=topic,include,Repertory%20Grid,1&mfacet=topic,include,Education,1&mfacet=topic,include,Repertory%20Grid%20Method,1&mfacet=topic,include,Higher%20Education,1&mfacet=rtype,include,book_chapters,2&mfacet=rtype,include,books,2&lang=en&mode=advanced&offset=0&pcAvailability=true&came_from=sort

41 results still including psychotherapy. Tried to refine publication date to 1955, forces 1975 and increases count to 1828.
It is putting journal articles in even though I have selected only book chapters and books.

---
What are the advantages of a ssr?

What do examples of SSR look like?
-

Why?

RepGrid is not effectively operationalised {McKellar, 2014 #1} in educational contexts where it could be of value.

The search should be inclusive {McKellar, 2014 #1}








Remember to go back later on an merge the semi-dup RIS variables.



So I'm bringing the files into 2020 for ths scoping review because it allows me to use machine anlaysis as well as my own views to identify relevant materials.
