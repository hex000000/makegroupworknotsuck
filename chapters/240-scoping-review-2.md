## Search Procedure Stage 2

The first stage of the search procedure cast a wide net across a comprehensive set of scholarly resources in order to establish a foundation of work. As both data and metadata was inconsistent between sources, so far only duplicates within document sets have been counted. This was to avoid removing duplicates which have more information than their matching record at a stage where the subset of relevant documents was not clear, or when manual review of the full-text is needed to see if two documents with seemingly identical titles are duplicates or two separate works. However, there is likely to be significant overlap between the sources and full-text may be available from one but not other sources. In each case of a duplicate record, the record with the most metadata and data will be retained, and the other databases it was found in will be noted so we can observe whether specific types of studies tend to be found in particular databases.

As the dataset of studies in a higher education context is quite large it seems appropriate to follow the advice of {Alexander, 2020 #10}, and tie the criteria for inclusion at this stage to the research question in a meaningful way. As in {Arksey, 2005 #1}, it was necessary to gain familiarity with the literature before these criteria were clear. {Alexander, 2020 #10} and {Peters, 2015 #6} both emphasise the importance of making these criteria explicit, and {Alexander, 2020 #10} also recommends citing an example of work affected at each stage. {Kastner, 2012 #4} describe this as an audit trail demonstrating the &quot;trustworthiness&quot; of the review [_meta-interpretation_ Table 1, p3], using raw data to develop exclusion criteria and focusing on meaning in context. While their research is focused in health care, the discussion of knowledge synthesis methods remains relevant, with this review being most like the _meta-interpretation_; not focused on traditional measures of effect size, reliability and validity, differing from _meta-ethnography_ in that it doesn&#39;t theorise about the range of findings discovered; from _meta-narrative_ in that it doesn&#39;t explicitly map across or between research traditions; from _meta-study_ as it doesn&#39;t combine smaller _meta_s, from _meta-summary_ as there are no distinctive features of survey results or effect sizes, and from _meta-synthesis_ as it doesn&#39;t attempt a phenomenological interpretation. It will become clear that this is because the nature of Repertory Grid Technique studies in education, and the data it produces, does not neatly fit with more conventional approaches.

### Criteria for inclusion and exclusion

#### Out

Familiarity with the literature through conducting Search Stage 1 has made clear that there are multiple study types, with widely varying populations, and inconsistent theoretical bases. There are some sets of studies which have great depth of work, for example, longitudinal studies of pre- and in-service teacher development using critical reflection, which require a compartmentalised approach as they are both domain- and population-specific. A similarly large body of work exists in relation to pre- and in-service nurses, and pre- and in-service social workers. As my goal is to identify how the RepGrid technique is used as an intervention in higher education, these are out of my scope but offer great resources for other scholars. Purely theoretical works making suggestions about how the Repertory Grid Technique might be used to good effect will also be excluded here.

Studies will be excluded where RepGrid is used only as a survey method, for example, about course evaluation, or where the student population is incidental to the study, for example, where the participants include a broad cross-section of society and the question is about psychology. I will also exclude studies in school (K-12) settings, vocational guidance and educational leadership settings. It is difficult to know whether to exclude vocational and adult education, as there will be some similarities in context, but in the interests of timely provision of this study that will also be excluded at this stage; only potentially included if time permits and they meet all the inclusion criteria. I will exclude for the moment studies about using Repertory Grid Technique as a strategy for connecting postgraduate students and their supervisors. There is an interesting and productive series of work on using Repertory Grid Technique as a method for calibrating marking across assessment criteria which will also be set aside now. While that may not form part of this review, it is relevant to my larger study and may be the subject of a more in-depth review in future.

#### In

After considering the exclusions above, studies will be included in this review that meet all the following criteria:

1.
  1. Subject participants are undergraduate and/or postgraduate students in a university or college;
  2. The only participants in the study are these students;
  3. The only site for the study is in a university or college;
  4. The Repertory Grid Technique is used as a pedagogical tool â€“ that is, there is a learning outcome associated with its use, even if that outcome is not articulated in the study;
  5. The learning outcome is measured in an empirical way.

### Search method

All those studies for which full-text is needed were requested using the University of Sydney Library. Full-text was then uploaded to the MAXQDA application along with those studies that were not excluded in the first stage, and a new data-driven lexical search sequence started. In the first stage, I established that studies may not be found using &quot;educ\*&quot; as a term, instead using &quot;school&quot; or &quot;college&quot;, so the next search iteration will include all those terms for the &quot;ANY&quot; parameter to create a subset of results. I will follow this with a search for &quot;student\*&quot; OR &quot;\*graduate\*&quot; OR and another set. I will then search those two subsets for &quot;participant\*&quot; OR &quot;method\*&quot; OR &quot;result\*&quot; to locate studies closely matching my research question.

But before this it wold be good to exclude any which can now be eliminated now full-text has been acquired, or those which are no longer included because of the narrowing of scope.

## Full-text in/out

At the beginning of Stage 2, an audit was done of those full-texts which were accessible, with a view to excluding those not yet acquired, or those which can be assessed as not meeting the search criteria by manual review.
