It took a whole year, but after my meeting with Andrew yesterday something that has been turning over in the back of my mind finally became really clear. I know that I should be writing instead of driving to Sydney to meet with someone who's going to do the PhD I didn't know I wanted to do BUT I will go back to writing as I think this can have a place in the 'future research potential' of RepGrid.

When Erica ran the NetLogo class for 5024 last last year, I could see what we were doing was relevant for me but couldn't make the connection. I made lots and lots of Termite mounds (hence the new title for my research, Termites & Butterflies) and knew they were important.

I now see them as snapshots of knowledge models at a point in time. The are created by varying inputs and rules for interactions taking place over time. They provide immediate feedback when you vary the inputs. And they are both programmable and scalable.

I've been thinking (and talking to Andrew) a lot  about RepGrid being able to create learner models, then through comparison highlight areas of divergence from an "expert" model. A complete learner model may be comprised of multiple discipline (or ULO-based, or whatever), compared against multiple expert models. The expert model "set" may be idealised as a whole entity, or comprise of discrete models, depending on the level of sophistication/integration.

The model construction process takes place when the expert or learner completes a Rep Test. If we consider the patches in ABM to be grid squares, each square will have a numerical value. There will be a consequent difference or similarity between a single patch (rating of an element on a construct) in the expert and learner models, with an initial aim of that equalling zero, the expert and learner models having identical values.

At the moment, it is a manual process to compare two or more grids using either the RepPlus or the WebGrid applications. It is not user-friendly and requires some reference to the application documentation for both the process and potential immediate interpretation. With large datasets, it can be time-consuming to fully explore patterns across individuals and groups, and trajectories from initial to subsequent survey completions. However, the data this captures would be a rich and, from a Learning Sciences perspective, a _thick_ description of not only what has changed across constructs and elements, but all the incremental steps leading up to the change.
