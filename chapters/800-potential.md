It took a whole year, but after my meeting with Andrew yesterday something that has been turning over in the back of my mind finally became really clear. I know that I should be writing instead of driving to Sydney to meet with someone who's going to do the PhD I didn't know I wanted to do BUT I will go back to writing as I think this can have a place in the 'future research potential' of RepGrid.

When Erica ran the NetLogo class for 5024 last last year, I could see what we were doing was relevant for me but couldn't make the connection. I made lots and lots of Termite mounds (hence the new title for my research, Termites & Butterflies) and knew they were important.

I now see them as snapshots of knowledge models at a point in time. The are created by varying inputs and rules for interactions taking place over time. They provide immediate feedback when you vary the inputs. And they are both programmable and scalable.

I've been thinking (and talking to Andrew) a lot of about RepGrid being able to create learner models, then through comparison highlight areas of divergence from an "expert" model. A complete learner model may be comprised of multiple discipline (or ULO-based, or whatever), compared against multiple expert models. The expert model "set" may be idealised as a whole entity, or comprise of discrete models, depending on the level of sophistication/integration.
