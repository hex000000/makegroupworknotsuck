# Practice Repertory Grid technique

You can practice Repertory Grid Technique on a University of Sydney virtual machine, which you are welcome to experiment with. It is, like any online system, subject to occasional service interruptions and potential data loss. Make sure you download the data you want to keep as soon as possible, and [let me know](mailto:eablack@uni.sydney.edu.au "Email EB") if you need assistance.

Full acknowledgement of the work behind the web platform for Repertory Grid Technique goes to [Dr Mildred G Shaw and Dr Brian R Gaines at the University of Calgary](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/repplus/ "RepPlus website"). Previously available RepGrid servers are gradually being decommissioned and it would be a shame for this technique to fall into disuse as it has almost limitless potential for research and collaboration.

To access the server, you will first need to [install the University's VPN on your Mac or PC](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e10e1396db01b3485beaf9b7f4961981 "instructions for installing VPN") if you are not using a a computer connected to the University network. If you are getting a "Cannot connect to the server" error, the most likely cause is that you are not running the VPN.

1. Make sure you are on a university-networked computer or have [installed the University's VPN on your Mac or PC](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e10e1396db01b3485beaf9b7f4961981 "instructions for installing VPN")
2. Navigate to [the practice survey](http://10.83.67.230/WebGrid/Constructs/Cache/0050569DCA3EF3C94BAC4/0050569DCA3EF3C94CD7E.rgrid??+C "WebGrid")
3. Enter your name in the _Name_ field. Your responses will be visible to others using the practice activity, so you may want to use a pseudonym. Remove or change any other text on this screen. Click **Done**.

4. In this example, "elements" are already supplied. For each set of three elements, select one which is different to the othr two and explain why to create your "constructs" . Add notes in the large field if you would like to. Click **Add construct**.

5. Now rate each of the supplied elements on the constructs you provided. In this example, a rating of 5 means that it the element is about resources, where a rating of 1 indicates it's not about resources. You will see the user has rated "lack of relevance" at the non-resource end of the continuum, and "poor infrastructure" close to the resources pole. Click **Done**

6. Continue to add constructs. You might find some are quite closely related to others. When you go back to the main screen, click **Save**.

7. Look for the heading _Caching a grid in an allocated cache directory_. Paste 0050569DCA3EF3C94BAC4 in the _Specify your cache directory if you have been allocated one_ field. Click **Cache in directory**.

8. On the confirmation page you will see a set of URLs you can use to load your grid. Click the URL in the _To load the grid_ pane. You are now back on the main screen with your grid data saved.
9. Click the **Display** image. You will see your responses presented in a matrix. In this example, we can see that "lack of relevance" [=2] has been construed as close to "being forced to use it" [=1] on the continuum between "involuntariness" and "things I can't change", and close to "workplace culture"[=2] on the continuum between "about mindset and training" and "resourcing".

10. We can see that another grid has similar but slightly different framing around these questions.

11. If you [return to the cache page](http://10.83.67.230/WebGrid/Cache/0050569DCA3EF3C94BAC4 "Cache") you will see other grid responses. Using the radio buttons to select one grid in column A and another in Column B, you can **Compare A and B**.
In the example, you can see that responses are very similar, which means even though the respondents used different words, they construe those elements in a similar way. The largest difference is highlighted in grey on the bottom row, where Kelly has scored "workplace culture" [=1] as a completely human issue, and George has scored it [=3] in the middle of the continuum between "involuntariness" and "things I can't change". We might think that George is ambivalent about how workplace culture comes about, thinking of it partly as external, and partly as voluntary. This is the kind of nuance that could (a) be compared across respondents, and (b) be usefully elaborated in an interview.

12. Go back to the [WebGridPlus home page]("repgrid.makegroupworknotsuck.com" "Tutorial"), and under _WebGrid Tutorials_ click **Tutorial from _Think Again_ -- Carol's choices**. As well as reinforcing the elicitation process, this also gives helpful insights into the different ways to view and interpret RepGrid data.
