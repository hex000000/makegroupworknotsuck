# RepGrid Practice

You can practice Repertory Grid Technique on a University of Sydney virtual machine that you are welcome to experiment with. It is, like any online system, subject to occasional service interruptions and potential data loss. Make sure you download the data you want to keep as soon as possible, and [let me know](mailto:eablack@uni.sydney.edu.au "email me")  if you need assistance. I remain happy to be your go-to resource for all things RepGrid even after the completion of this unit. I am hoping it forms the bulk of my future research.

Full acknowledgement of the work behind the web platform for Repertory Grid Technique goes to [Dr Mildred G Shaw and Dr Brian R Gaines at the University of Calgary](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/repplus/ "RepPlus").  Previously available RepGrid servers are gradually being decommissioned and it would be a shame for this technique to fall into disuse as it has almost limitless potential for research and collaboration.

To access the server, you will first need to [install the University's VPN on your Mac or PC](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e10e1396db01b3485beaf9b7f4961981 "ICT information about installing VPN") if you are not using a computer connected to the University network. If you are getting a "_Cannot connect to the server_" error, the most likely cause is that you are not running the VPN.


1. Make sure you are on a university-networked computer or have [installed the University's VPN on your Mac or PC](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e10e1396db01b3485beaf9b7f4961981 "ICT information about installing VPN").

Navigate to the practice survey [installed the University's VPN on your Mac or PC](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e10e1396db01b3485beaf9b7f4961981 "ICT information about installing VPN").

Continue to add responses until either the response time has expired, or you have no further responses. The process will work best with six or more elements.
Click Add Element.
On the Elicitation & Analysis screen, read the different panes of text first :-)
Find "Can you think of a construct that distinguishes between the three elements...", then click the first button labelled Add Construct.

Click the radio button next to the item that is different from the other two in some way. In the first text field, write the way in which that item is different from the other two. In the text field after that, enter the way in which the other to items are similar to each other.
Click Add Construct.

On the Rate the elements on the new construct screen, use the drop-down menus to select where each element sits on a continuum using the difference/similarity polarities you entered on the previous screen. Click Done.
