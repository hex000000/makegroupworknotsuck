# Practice Repertory Grid technique

You can practice Repertory Grid Technique on a University of Sydney virtual machine, which you are welcome to experiment with. It is, like any online system, subject to occasional service interruptions and potential data loss. Make sure you download the data you want to keep as soon as possible, and [let me know](mailto:eablack@uni.sydney.edu.au "Email EB") if you need assistance.

Full acknowledgement of the work behind the web platform for Repertory Grid Technique goes to [Dr Mildred G Shaw and Dr Brian R Gaines at the University of Calgary](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/repplus/ "RepPlus website"). Previously available RepGrid servers are gradually being decommissioned and it would be a shame for this technique to fall into disuse as it has almost limitless potential for research and collaboration.

To access the server, you will first need to [install the University's VPN on your Mac or PC](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e10e1396db01b3485beaf9b7f4961981 "instructions for installing VPN") if you are not using a a computer connected to the University network. If you are getting a "Cannot connect to the server" error, the most likely cause is that you are not running the VPN.

1. Make sure you are on a university-networked computer or have [installed the University's VPN on your Mac or PC](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e10e1396db01b3485beaf9b7f4961981 "instructions for installing VPN").

2. Navigate to [the practice survey](http://10.83.67.230/WebGrid/Constructs/Cache/0050569DCA3EF3C94BAC4/0050569DCA3EF3C94CD7E.rgrid??+C "WebGrid")
3. Enter your name in the _Name_ field. Your responses will be visible to others using the practice activity, so you may want to use a pseudonym. Remove or change any other text on this screen. Click **Done**.

![Insert name here](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%209.57.38%20am.png "Insert name here")

4. In this example, "elements" are already supplied. For each set of three elements, select one which is different to the othr two and explain why to create your "constructs". Add notes in the large field if you would like to. Click **Add construct**.

![Triadic elicitiation](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%2010.00.02%20am.png "Traidic elicitation screen")

5. Now rate each of the supplied elements on the constructs you provided. In this example, a rating of 5 means that it the element is about resources, where a rating of 1 indicates it's not about resources. You will see the user has rated "lack of relevance" at the non-resource end of the continuum, and "poor infrastructure" close to the resources pole. Click **Done**.

![Rating other elements on those constructs](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%2010.03.24%20am.png "Rating all elements on those constructs")

6. Continue to add constructs. You might find some are quite closely related to others. When you go back to the main screen, click **Save**. The system will return you to the main screen after three constructs. You can add more by simply clicking the **Add Construct** button. When you have finished adding extra constructs, click **Cancel** to return to the main screen.

![Save from this screen](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%2010.10.14%20am.png "Save")

7. Look for the heading _Caching a grid in an allocated cache directory_. Paste 0050569DCA3EF3C94BAC4 in the _Specify your cache directory if you have been allocated one_ field. Click **Cache in directory**.

_The system deletes data more than three months old. Please download any data you want to save._

![Cache your grid](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%2010.12.16%20am.png "Caching your grid")

8. On the confirmation page you will see a set of URLs you can use to load your grid. Click the URL in the _To load the grid_ pane. You are now back on the main screen with your grid data saved.

9. Click the **Display** image. You will see your responses presented in a matrix. In this example, we can see that "lack of relevance" [=2] has been construed as close to "being forced to use it" [=1] on the continuum between "involuntariness" and "things I can't change", and close to "workplace culture"[=2] on the continuum between "about mindset and training" and "resourcing".

![Display your grid](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%2011.02.11%20am.png "Display your grid")

10. We can see that another grid has similar but slightly different framing around these questions.

![Second set of grid responses](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%2010.22.48%20am.png "Second set of grid responses")

11. If you [return to the cache page](http://10.83.67.230/WebGrid/Cache/0050569DCA3EF3C94BAC4 "Cache") you will see other grid responses. Using the radio buttons to select one grid in column A and another in Column B, you can **Compare A and B**.

![Compare grids](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%2010.24.32%20am.png "Compare grids")

In the example, you can see that responses are very similar, which means even though the respondents used different words, they construe those elements in a similar way. The largest difference is highlighted in grey on the bottom row, where Kelly has scored "workplace culture" [=1] as a completely human issue, and George has scored it [=3] in the middle of the continuum between "involuntariness" and "things I can't change". We might think that George is ambivalent about how workplace culture comes about, thinking of it partly as external, and partly as voluntary. This is the kind of nuance that could (a) be compared across respondents, and (b) be usefully elaborated in an interview.

![Comparing grids in detail](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-20%20at%2010.25.20%20am.png "Comparison in detail")

12. Go back to the [WebGridPlus home page]("repgrid.makegroupworknotsuck.com" "Tutorial"), and under _WebGrid Tutorials_ click **Tutorial from _Think Again_ -- Carol's choices**. As well as reinforcing the elicitation process, this also gives helpful insights into the different ways to view and interpret RepGrid data.

Click Add Another.

Continue to add responses until either the response time has expired, or you have no further responses. The process will work best with six or more elements.
Click Add Element.
On the Elicitation & Analysis screen, read the different panes of text first :-)
Find "Can you think of a construct that distinguishes between the three elements...", then click the first button labelled Add Construct.

Click the radio button next to the item that is different from the other two in some way. In the first text field, write the way in which that item is different from the other two. In the text field after that, enter the way in which the other to items are similar to each other.
Click Add Construct.

On the Rate the elements on the new construct screen, use the drop-down menus to select where each element sits on a continuum using the difference/similarity polarities you entered on the previous screen. Click Done.

Continue to click the Add Construct button until either the response time has expired, or you have no further responses.
Click Save.
On the Main Page find Caching a grid in an allocated directory.
In the field labelled Specify your cache directory... enter 0050569DCA3EF128B61E5, then click Cache in directory.
