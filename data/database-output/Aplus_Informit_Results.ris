%X This article reports on how educators from child care, community-based kindergarten, preschool and lower primary settings changed their tightly held constructs about curriculum design after undertaking an in-service professional development (PD) program. Kelly's personal construct psychology (PCP) provided the framework for the PD and for identifying and analysing the educators' constructs and the changes that occurred. Initially teachers from all settings mainly focused on children as objects of their curriculum decision making. After the PD program the focus on children's input changed to a more negotiated approach to curriculum design - especially by teachers in childcare and kindergarten settings. Differences between cohorts were also found in changes to thinking about parents' and administrators' input into curriculum decisions which related to their ECEC contexts. Outcomes from the study can be used to demonstrate ways of analysing changes in thinking about curriculum design after engaging in PD, and the effects of educational context on these changes.

%X This paper focuses on Scotland's policy response to the International Adult Literacy Survey (1994-1998) and the 'grand experiment' to implement a social practices perspective of literacies. This radical perspective, derived from the New Literacy Studies (NLS), has profound implications for pedagogy and is promoted in Scotland as 'the social practice approach'. The paper begins with a discussion of the distinctive developments in Scottish policy in the context of the international interest in Adult Literacy. The rhetorical claims made in Scotland are then examined through a study which used a methodology drawn from Personal Construct Theory (PCT) to explore how practitioners understand 'the social practice approach'. This research found little connection between the theoretical concepts of the New Literacy Studies and practitioners' interpretations. Dissonances in the data highlighted power issues between policy and practice. In the latter part of the paper, Bernstein's (2000) ideas about how theoretical knowledge is translated into pedagogical knowledge are used to explore the dissonances further. The paper concludes that there is an ideological conflict of purpose within the discourses of adult literacies in Scotland and that the critical pedagogy implied by the New Literacy Studies is also necessary within teacher education if practice is to be transformed in response to the radical social theory.

%K Artifacts  ;Dogs  ;Mediation 
%X This research aims to explore and develop a framework for understanding the mediating role of dogs in people's learning processes in vocational education and training settings. Specifically, it aims to answer two questions: In what ways do people use dogs as mediating artifacts in their meaning-making processes; and what are the effects of dogs in mediating individual and group learning processes? This study examines the lived experiences and reflections of 15 students and their teachers who interacted with three dogs during a six and a half day vocational education and training course. The course was held in a major regional centre in northern Australia by a private training provider.  The research employed six data collection techniques: a pre-course questionnaire; classroom observations; a critical events technique; the  repertory   grid   technique ; post-course interviews; and the researcher's personal journal.  The results of this study suggest that there were four dichotomous dimensions of people's use of the dogs: Active-reFlective (A-F), Initiating-Responding (I-R), Material-Conceptual (M-C) and Spontaneous- Planned (S-P). These dimensions appear to resonate with three of the Big Five dimensions of personality. The Big Five dimensions of personality have been used to understand the different ways in which people learn. This suggests that people's use of the dogs as artifacts may share possible relationships with dimensions of personality and people's learning styles. Exploring these relationships suggested a previously hidden dimension of artifact use, Emotional-Logical (E-L), that may be congruent with another dimension of personality. Additionally, these dimensions appear to share dynamic relationships that may provide a deeper understanding of how people used the dogs as artifacts, by illustrating how they work and interact together. The results of this study also revealed Paws For Thought the functioning of individual preferences within these dimensions, which may have been moderated by a number of factors. The results of this study suggest that the mediating role of the dogs may be understood by the way they appeared to have functioned as artifacts in three domains of the learning environment: cognitive, affective and social. In the cognitive domain the dogs may be seen to have functioned as artifacts by stimulating arousal, attention, focus and concentration through positive distraction. In the affective domain the dogs may be seen to have functioned as artifacts by: triggering positive emotional responses to arousal; stimulating feelings of enjoyment, calm, warmth and peace; and by fostering a relaxed and informal atmosphere. In the social domain the dogs may be seen to have functioned as artifacts by: serving as a social ice-breaker, providing a value-free conversation starter; and by functioning in people's perceptions of others through the use of social axioms, which may have factored in the construction of their social relationships. This study is significant because it provides new knowledge by offering a framework for understanding the mediating role of dogs in people's learning processes. It therefore provides a map to understand in what ways dogs may be seen to function as artifacts and how this works. It also opens up ways of seeing and understanding what may occur in other settings, and provides new ways of being attentive to what happens in the classroom. The examination of the processes that take place during people's interaction with the dogs also provides new knowledge by offering a framework to understand how and why these interactions make the results reported by researchers possible. It may therefore open the way for improving animal assisted therapy and education programs, and adapting them to situations beyond therapeutic and childhood education settings. This study holds significance for practitioners because it provides the opportunity to broaden traditional theories of artifacts and artifact use to include animals alongside the inanimate. It may also extend established understandings of artifacts and their use in the classroom. This understanding suggests the importance for practitioners to know how to use artifacts in different ways, and to show and teach those ways to others. This study holds further significance for practitioners because it reveals insights into how teachers may bridge the teacher student divide by balancing their traditional focus on assessable outcomes and the task environment, with students' inherently social learning processes.

%X This paper describes a study about artefacts and gender that is part of a doctoral study.  Interviews with industrial designers and engineers were conducted during the study using a  Repertory   Grid   Technique .  The starting point was not gender but to examine design activities in technology education and working life. The results show that the interviewees give the same artefact similar attributes. Two artefacts are described as contrasting; they are also named female and male, respectively. The 'female' artefact, a Reindeer figurine, is described with attributes that belong to home, aesthetics and of no use, while the 'male' object, a pair of Revolving punch pliers, is characterised as functional, useful and non attractive. Wajcman emphasises that the concept of technology is based on male activities and traditions and that those characterisations still define technology and are affecting the design and developing of artefacts. Artefacts are also tied to the social networks in which they are located. This paper raises questions like; do artefacts reflect our thinking about gender and is it a matter of importance in technology education? [Author abstract]

%X This thesis examines the interaction between the new national curriculum reform and primary school teachers' mindsets in relation to teaching and learning through a mixed-method study of the teachers' responses to the New Curriculum after the scale-up stage (2004 - 2005) of the reform in Suzhou, China. The author clarifies the interaction between the reform and teachers' mindsets and the challenges the reform might face in the following years. The author charts the teachers' responses along two dimensions. One is their responses through the lens of mindset theory, which includes their beliefs, values and practices. The other is their responses through the lens of teaching and learning approaches, which includes views of the school and class (community of learners), the teacher and teaching strategies, the students and learning activities, the curriculum and assessment.  Data have been collected through a survey (10 primary schools), as well as in case studies including classroom observations, open-ended interviews and  repertory   grid  interviews (six teachers).  The collective examination of teachers' mindsets shows a complex response pattern. On one hand, the results from both scales (the Teachers' Beliefs Survey and the Constructivist Teaching Inventory) show that most teachers report strongly believing in constructivist approaches and frequently practising constructivist approaches. On the other hand, three kinds of evidence from the survey data show that the values, beliefs and practices of the teachers did not consistently align with constructivist approaches. In other words, the constructivist mindset is not evident in teachers' teaching approaches. The within-case analysis shows some strong contradictions among the six teachers in their factual beliefs about the nature of the changes to the new curriculum reform, which ranged from a perception of a total change to a perception of a return to earlier practice. Nevertheless, the cross-case analysis shows that the individual variation in response to change and the degree of acceptance was linked to the interaction between the reform-generated curriculum and its requirements and teachers' personal mindsets in relation to teaching and learning approaches. This thesis adds to traditional research methods on educational reform by integrating two research dimensions, the mindset framework and the curriculum framework. This thesis challenges the argument that teachers are responsible for the success or failure of the reform. Using the results from both the quantitative research and the qualitative research, The author argues that teachers are also learners in the process of the reform. If and only if the teachers' personal experience and the external supports both work in constructivist ways will constructivist education reform be a real success. [Author abstract]

%X This article reports on the findings of a study into relationships among principals and stakeholders. There is little doubt that relationships with school stakeholders are very important. However, each stakeholder group can have different expectations of, and on, the principal. In the study of interest here, eight 'experienced' school administrators, four TPs (teaching-principals) and four NTPs (non-teaching principals) were each engaged in a structured interview process to determine how their professional relationships impacted on either their effectiveness or ineffectiveness as leaders of their school. Each group comprised an equal numbers of males and females, all working in the Hume Region in the State of Victoria.  Using a  repertory   grid   technique  approach to structure the conversations with principals, it became apparent that a school could be modelled as two con-centric circles with the principal at the centre.  Within the central circle were the principal and other school insiders where the relationship was positive, professional and personal. Outsiders were to be found beyond the external circle. Here, the relationships were dysfunctional and professional. Between the insiders and the outsiders were a more benign group where the relation- ship was professional. [Author abstract]

%X This study investigated the cognitive strategies that underpin assessors' holistic judgments of a school-based vocationally-related portfolio performance. Using a portfolio already identified as containing borderline qualities, quantitative data were gathered about features that six assessors attended to as they holistically evaluated the portfolio.  This information was gathered through verbal protocols and supplemented with information from a modified Kelly's  Repertory   Grid  interview technique.  This elicited assessors' perceptions about the characteristics of the assessment criteria, allowing the influence of each factor to be ranked. Another objective was to collect qualitative data about the socio-contextual features in which the assessors' practices were situated. The study uses Activity Theory to explore the relationship between the factors that potentially influence assessors' judgments, suggesting a theoretical position that assessor judgments are influenced or framed within the context of their experience and differing perspectives.

%X This paper describes the use of the  repertory   grid   technique  to elicit the police trainees' and trainers' personal constructs in order to distinguish prevailing discourses in police training.  This research is in response to a literature review of the interaction of gender, 'Othering' and discourses in police organisations. Anecdotal evidence and the literature reveal that pedagogical training methods are predominantly used in police training environments. Australian and international studies into police management education have revealed a 'resistant anti-intellectual subculture' and a set of unconscious and unchallengeable assumptions regarding police work, conduct, and leadership which prevents honest critical thinking. An analysis of training is pertinent given the national agenda for policing to become a profession. [Author abstract]

%X This chapter describes the  repertory   grid   technique  (RepGrid), the theories behind it, some illustrative examples and the merits and drawbacks of the method.  It ends with a review of different uses of the method and an annotated bibliography of some relevant research studies. By describing RepGrid, the author shows how to elicit underlying, often tacit criteria that professional teachers use when they assess creative work. These criteria may be used to enhance a student's development from novice to expert. Some of these criteria may have universal value for the development of skill and creativity in school subjects other than technology, art and craft. The Swedish National Curriculum of 'Teknik' is goal-oriented, emphasizing documented learning outcomes including the development of design abilities and creativity. The researchers asked: What kind of criteria to teachers in Swedish schools when they are assessing and grading a design and construction project in the subject 'Teknik'? RepGrid is an interview technique that utilises an individual's ability to compare elements to elicit attitudes, category- making, assessing criteria and probably some personal knowledge. It is a qualitative method in which statistical methods may be used to enhance analysis. RepGrid is a fruitful technique that could be widely adopted for research and development purposes throughout design and technology education and practice. [Author abstract, ed]

The importance of the book is that it highlights the uniqueness of the area of technology education in terms of content, and learning and teaching processes, and the need to provide methods and techniques to capture this uniqueness when undertaking research. The book comprises research methods and techniques being used by a range of current researchers. Each chapter includes details of the method or technique, but does so in terms of a project where it was used. This provides important contextual material that will help researchers when developing research projects. The book contains research methods and techniques that are new in general as well as ones new to technology education and ones that are variations to existing methods and techniques to make them suitable for use in technology education research.

%X Teamwork sits comfortably within the vocabularies of most physical education teachers. Yet few pedagogy theorists have considered what teamwork refers to, let alone what it means to teach it. This does not necessarily constitute a problem. Pedagogues could have sophisticated understandings of teamwork and its didactic application without supporting theoretical or scholarly documentation. The problem, however, is that since no one has investigated teachers' constructions of teamwork, we do not know whether this is the case or not. The current project begins to address this problem by examining the meanings that practitioners assign teamwork. The specific questions addressed in this dissertation are: What does teamwork mean to physical educators? How do teachers account for teamwork in a pedagogical sense? And, what rationale(s) do teachers offer for teaching teamwork? The empirical component comprised a single-site case study of one school near Brisbane. With each of the seven teachers in the health and physical education department, three sets of interviews were conducted in a reflexive manner. The first interviews were biographical in nature and were conducted to gain contextual information from the teachers.  The second set of interviews utilised Kelly's  repertory   grid   technique .  These interviews were designed to generate general responses to the theme 'teamwork in health and physical education'. The final interviews were semi-structured with schedules based on the previous two interviews. Specific statements of the teachers' previous interviews were used as starting points for elaboration, explanation and justification. A combination of discourse analytic and social constructionist principles provided the orienting perspective for the research and the first and third sets of interviews were transcribed and analysed discursively. The notions of interpretive repertoires and ideological dilemmas were employed as central concepts for making sense of the teachers' language. An engagement with a range of discourse literature provided further resources for understanding the 'micro-elements', or linguistic features, of the teachers' constructions. Analysis of the teachers' data indicated (1) little regularity in the ways teachers make sense of teamwork; (2) a reliance on a set of surrogate linguistic/conceptual frameworks to explain teamwork; (3) a lack of articulation between teachers' constructions of teamwork and a body of supporting literature; (4) the personal and insular nature of explanations of teamwork pedagogies; and (5) a tendency for pedagogical explanations of teamwork to describe the reproduction of dominant discourses. Notwithstanding the variety and the difficulties identified in responses, the teachers agreed that teamwork was an important outcome of participation in physical education. In lieu of a conclusion and in response to the shortcomings identified during analysis, the author presents an alternative way of thinking about the concept. The 'new' way of thinking about teamwork is an attempt to provoke discussion that may lead to consensus regarding teamwork. This alternative is based on discursive and social constructionist thinking and foregrounds language use in the construction of team relationships. A reciprocal element to relationships is acknowledged, along with the cultural and history-bounded nature of language use. The author proposes that a different way of understanding teamwork may lead to alternative ways of understanding the practice and theory of physical education. [Author abstract]

%X The new 1-9 curriculum framework in Taiwan provides a remarkable change from previous frameworks in terms of the coverage of content and the powers of teachers.  This study employs a modified  repertory   grid   technique  to investigate biology teachers' preferences with regard to six curriculum components.  One hundred and eighty-five in-service and pre-service biology teachers were asked to determine which science curriculum components they liked and disliked most of all to include in their biology classes. The data show that the rank order of these science curriculum components, from top to bottom, was as follows: application of science, manipulation skills, scientific concepts, social/ethical issues, problem-solving skills, and the history of science. They also showed that pre-service biology teachers, as compared with in-service biology teachers, favoured problem-solving skills significantly more than manipulative skills, while in-service biology teachers, as compared with pre-service biology teachers, favoured manipulative skills significantly more than problem-solving skills. Some recommendations for ensuring the successful implementation of the Taiwanese 1-9 curriculum framework are also proposed. [Author abstract]

%X In the increasingly competitive Australian tertiary education market, a consumer orientation is essential. This is particularly so for small regional campuses that compete with larger universities in the state capitals. Campus management needs to carefully monitor both the perceptions of prospective students within the catchment area, and the (dis)satisfaction levels of current students. This study reports the results of an exploratory investigation into the perceptions held of a small regional campus, using two techniques that have arguably been underutilised in the education marketing literature.  Repertory   Grid  Analysis, a technique developed fifty years ago, was used to identify attributes deemed salient to year 12 high school students at the time they were applying for university places.  Importance-performance analysis (IPA), developed three decades ago, was then used to identify attributes that were determinant for a new cohort of first year undergraduate students.  The paper concludes that group applications of  Repertory   Grid  offer education market researchers a useful technique for identifying attributes used by high school students to differentiate universities; and that IPA is a useful technique for guiding promotional decision making.  In this case the two techniques provided a quick, economic and effective snapshot of market perceptions, which can be used as a foundation for the development of an ongoing market research program.

%K Physical Education Intervention Program (PEIP) 
%X This thesis focuses on the teaching of physical education by generalist primary school teachers and the impact of a six-month intervention program on their ability to promote life-long physical activity. The thesis does not enter into the debate of whether physical education should be taught by specialist teachers or generalist teaches. It looks at the knowledge and skills of those who teach physical education and how teachers' knowledge and skills can be incorporated into a professional development intervention program. As a major source of date and learning for this study the author carried out a six-month in-service Physical Education Intervention Program (PElP). This is an intervention program where a group of six generalist in-service teachers (participants) worked with pre-service teachers (buddies) to enable development of their knowledge and skills in teaching physical education. This intervention program is unique in that it brought together both pre- and in-service teachers in a professional development program that focused on developing knowledge and skills in teaching physical education. This allowed the combination of theory and practice in physical education classes within an action learning program, which allowed for reflective practice. The PEIP sought to challenge and change participants' espoused and enacted theories of action in teaching physical education through an action learning approach. This thesis proposes that generalist teachers may not have had positive experiences in physical education and sport in their own lives and may not have had their physical education teaching theories shaped by such life experiences or challenged during their pre-service teacher training. Their past personal experiences in physical education and sport may impact upon their enacted theories of teaching physical. The author proposed that through an action learning program PEIP can challenge participants' espoused and enacted theories. PEIP can thus also become a catalyst for change through increasing participants' knowledge and skills, which can result in improving teaching practices in physical education. Overall, the research makes twelve contributions to theory and practice across the areas of teacher professional development and physical education.  Contributions to practice include: an effective model of professional development intervention; recognition of holistic professional relationships that help participants through transformative change; a new application of the  repertory   grid   technique  with primary school teachers; a professional development integration package; a systemic model of the work environment for teaching physical education; new strategies for developing teachers' knowledge in action.  Contributions to theory include: a multi-dimensional model of effective roles in teaching physical education; a systems model for collaborative professional development for both pre-service and in-service teachers; development of the concept of 'life-long' physical activity through school physical education; transfer of the concepts of PEIP to pre-service teacher education; the precedent of using an action learning and action research approach across the curriculum; a new methodological framework for action learning and action research. This thesis focuses on professional development in physical education in primary schools. However, it clearly has potential for useful application and research across primary schools in other curriculum areas, in secondary schools, and in higher education, particularly in pre-service training of generalist primary school teachers.

%X It is clear from the literature that attention should .be paid to teachers' beliefs about how the mathematics classroom operates and about the nature of mathematical problem solving. The introduction of a mathematical problem-solving curriculum which ignores these aspects is likely to be frustrated. This research seeks to learn more about the use mathematical problem solving by Tongan teachers and what these teachers consider to be good teaching of mathematics and mathematical problem solving.  Five mathematics teachers in the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga education system were interviewed about their beliefs using the Kelly  Repertory   Grid   technique  through Enquire Within software.  Surveys were also conducted of the material produced for schools by the Tongan Government's Ministry of Education. It was found that the Ministry of Education has implemented a minimal problem-solving curriculum throughout the Kingdom and that the beliefs of the majority of teachers interviewed were compatible with this minimalist model. Recommendations for the Free Wesleyan Church's education department are made on possible approaches to fulfilling the Ministry of Education's stated aim of preparing students to apply the principles of mathematics to unfamiliar situations.

%X The study described in this paper is an interpretive embedded case study which presents changes in personal constructs about technological activity held by a group of first year undergraduate students enrolled in a design studio course within an information technology degree program.  Data sources included a  repertory   grid , interviews, video and audio recordings of classroom interactions, field notes of classroom observations, and artefacts such as handouts and other course materials.   The  repertory   grid , used at the beginning and end of the one semester course, is examined in conjunction with other data sources to describe changes in students' views about technological processes involved in engaging in design projects within an information technology context.  Using the case study of one of the students, links between her changed views and the structures and implementation of the course are made. Implications for incorporating explicit teaching about technological and design processes within information technology degree programs are discussed. [Author abstract]

%X In this paper, technology is described as involving processes whereby resources are utilised to satisfy human needs or to take advantage of opportunities, to develop practical solutions to problems. This study, set within one type of technology context, information technology, investigated how, through a one semester undergraduate course, elements of technological processes were made explicit to students. While it was acknowledged in the development and implementation of this course that students needed to learn technical skills, technological skills and knowledge, including design, were seen as vital also, to enable students to think about information technology from a perspective that was not confined and limited to 'technology as hardware and software'. This paper describes how the course, set within a three year program of study, was aimed at helping students to develop their thinking and their knowledge about design processes in an explicit way.  An interpretive research approach was used and data sources included a  Repertory   Grid  'survey'; student interviews; video recordings of classroom interactions, audio recordings of lectures, observations of classroom interactions made by researchers; and artefacts which included students' journals and portfolios.  The development of students' knowledge about design practices is discussed and reflections upon student knowledge development in conjunction with their learning experiences are made. Implications for ensuring explicitness of design practice within information technology contexts are presented, and the need to identify what constitutes design knowledge is argued.

%X This article reports the results of research conducted with a group of postgraduate primary education students in an urban higher education institution in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the research was to examine students' images of geography and to see whether these affected them as teachers of primary geography both in terms of what they chose to teach and how they chose to teach it.  The Personal Construct Psychology technique of  Repertory   Grid  was used to elicit the students' personal images of geography.  These were then compared with the image portrayed during teaching, and with the students' teaching styles. The findings indicate that there was little relationship between the students' pre-course image of geography and that portrayed in their teaching. Tentative conclusions suggest that for these students, whether novices in terms of the subject or not, all are reduced to the state of novice when it comes to teaching geography in primary schools.

%X This paper is an interpretive embedded case study of the changes in personal constructs about the nature of technology and technology processes as a result of engaging in a technology project. The sample was a cohort of pre-service primary school teachers enrolled in a technology course unit.  Data sources included survey instruments and interviews about the nature of technology and technology processes, field notes, video- and audio-taping of classroom transactions as students engaged in a series of technology activities and completed a design technology project, a  Repertory   Grid  instrument investigating changes in views of design processes before and after the activities.  The paper investigates the changes in views of the wider class group and a more detailed case study of changes in views of one student, including how the experience influenced views about implementation of design technology in primary classrooms.

%K Physical education teachers  ;Teacher education 
%X The purpose of this study was to understand how becoming a physical education teacher is shaped by personally and socially constructed knowledge and is affected by the rules and resources of the structural systems in which physical education teacher education (PETE) takes place. Ten PETE students participated in the study over almost three years.  They undertook  repertory   grid  sessions periodically through their study, followed by 'learning conversations', in which the grid itself was discussed, reworked and collaboratively analysed.  All conversations were audio taped and were fully transcribed. The data were analysed in three ways, all of which were used to construct a story of the study. First, the grids were analysed for patterns, consistencies across students and for consistencies within students. The grids provided the first level story that related to constructions of knowledge. These constructions were then content analysed using analysis categories developed from Gergen's notion of the saturated self and Giddens' ideas of identity in late modernity. These analyses represented what Giddens calls a double hermeneutic since to all intents and purposes, the story of the study was constructed from the participants' constructions of what it is to be a physical education teacher. The data suggest that during the process of constructing professional knowledge the students experienced a series of dilemmas of professional self- identity. It seems that to become a PE teacher, the dilemmas must be worked through until a position of what Giddens calls ontological security has been achieved. Some students in this study had not managed to reach such a point before they left university and entered the teaching profession. In spite of this, the methods of the study allowed the participants to begin to articulate their theories and visions of teaching physical education. The therapeutic qualities of Kelly's theory encouraged a number of the students to 'see it differently' and to begin to develop a rationale for physical education based on educational practice that considers the needs of individuals and the promotion of a socially just community. It is argued that this 'critical' approach to physical education pedagogy was considered risky and as such students who were prepared to engage in such risk strategies also had other strategic relational selves to minimise risk at key times during their teacher education.

%X This paper presents results of research that explored students' constructs about energy.  During the implementation of a constructivist learning approach, constructs from students in three classes were elicited using a  repertory   grid  method, both before and after completing a module of work dealing with energy.  Results from repertory grids showed that students who experienced the constructivist approach provided significantly more constructs, and of a wider nature, than students who were taught in their usual fashion.  Results from a school test administered to all three classes and the differences found between the results from the  repertory   grid  techniques and the school test are then discussed.  This paper concludes that students taught with the constructivist approach had much increased personal knowledge concerning energy, more so than those students taught in the traditional manner, and also that students taught with the constructivist approach learnt the school science equally as well as those students taught in the usual fashion.

%X A major emphasis in design and technology curriculum programs for primary school is the engagement of children in hands-on construction of technological artefacts. The children are expected to use design processes in an environment that may resemble, in various ways, the environment in which designers and engineers work. The concept of authentic learning environments may be used to describe such practices and contexts. This paper describes an investigation, using an interpretive research methodology, into preservice primary teachers' views of the learning environment established during their participation in a design and technology subject that included, as key components, an introductory, structured sequence of learning experiences followed by work on an open-ended technology project. Students enrolled in a one-year postgraduate teacher education program were the informants in the study.  Insights into students' views about the learning environment were obtained using survey instruments, interviews, field notes and a  Repertory   Grid .  Additional insights were obtained by videotaping and audiotaping the activities and discourse of focus groups during practical sessions. The paper examines selected cases and reasons underpinning major changes in their views of the learning environment. An analysis of the influence of the design and technology subject and learning environment on students' thinking about teaching technology in the classroom is also presented in the paper. Implications of the findings for the preparation of preservice teachers in the key learning area of technology are discussed.

%X This study investigated the personal practical knowledge of twenty- one Barbadian teachers in relation to a range of pedagogic practices advocated for use in the education of children under five years of age. The investigation of this knowledge was based on an interpretative perspective.  The conceptual underpinning was framed by Personal Construct Psychology, and its methodology, the  repertory   grid   technique .  The grid was formulated and used in a sample of schools with under-fives. Findings were clarified, confirmed and elaborated by the use of in- depth interviews conducted with teachers in their classroom settings. The findings revealed that teachers construed pedagogic practices from two perspectives. First, those concerned with the total development of the child, and second, those which emphasised cognitive development. The factors associating the practices and the perspectives were presented under five major themes: Consideration of the child; Benefits to the under-fives; Classroom experiences; Traditional academic focus; and Teacher's versus child dominance. Eclectic constructions and uses of teaching practices were clearly evident. Individual choices were varied and at times conflicting; they derived from the teachers' own construct systems, their anticipation of events in early childhood education, and their technical, cultural and theoretical knowledge. The implications and recommendations made in this study provide the basis for the development of coherent teaching strategies for early childhood education in Barbados.

%X Many novice primary school teachers have a low level of confidence in their ability to teach the key learning area of technology. This low level of confidence may be related to their naive perceptions of technology and technology education and lack of exposure to appropriate design and technology teaching and learning experiences in preservice primary teacher education programs. The effectiveness of technology education subjects in changing preservice teachers' perceptions of technology and technology education may be enhanced by the use of open-ended project work. This paper reports on an investigation, using an interpretive research methodology, of changes in preservice primary teachers' thinking about technology and technology education, prior to, and as a result of their engagement in open- ended technology projects similar to ones that might be typically suggested by primary school children.  Students enrolled in a one year postgraduate teacher education program were the participants in the study and the methods of data collection included the use of survey instruments, interviews, field notes and a  Repertory   Grid .  This paper analyses the influence of open-ended technology projects on students' thinking about technology and technology education and discusses implications of the approach for the design of technology education subjects in preservice teacher education programs.

%X This reports on an initial pilot study at Central Queensland University, Sydney campus, to identify the learning style and cultural attributes that may impact on students in flexible learning environments. The study trialed an integrated approach to data collection using both quantitative and qualitative tools. These tools were selected with the express intention of minimising the inherent cultural bias of the researchers wherever possible.  The tools selected and administered included Kelly's  Repertory   Grid , observation of student sessions and the administration of Witkin's Group Embedded Figures Test.  The paper discusses the outcomes of the pilot study, considers the strengths and weaknesses of the methods trialed, and concludes with some suggestions as to how the information gained from this pilot study may be used in the subsequent major study.

%X Case studies were conducted to identify, describe, and compare three preservice teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics during their initial six months in a teacher education program. The research framework stipulated an inclusive conception of beliefs and used Ernest's (1989) model to specify the beliefs under investigation.  Repertory   grid  interviews were conducted to elicit emerging themes as the program began and evolving themes six months later.  Data included responses to beliefs instruments, interview transcripts, program artifacts, and observation field notes. The researcher was a participant observer in the program. Subjects shared six emerging themes: classroom relationships, management, discovery activities, assessment, communication and motivation. Emerging themes differed in conceptions of student learning and in recognition of being in transition. Subjects shared four evolving themes: student learning, active student involvement, management and motivation. Evolving themes differed in attention to student responsibility, mathematical perspectives and regard for classroom environment and assessment.

%X Research into individual thinking about algebra faces a significant problem in the tacit nature of knowledge in this domain.  This paper documents a research design which incorporated  repertory   grid  principles within an image-based research model.  Finely detailed study of perceptions of algebraic images offered a powerful complement to the more usual verbal approaches, providing insights into both student thinking about key concepts in algebra, and into the network of relations within which such concepts exist for individuals learning algebra.

%X This research adopted a longitudinal case study approach to answer four questions: What conceptions of science teaching did the science graduates in this study bring to the preservice teacher education course? What changes occurred in each participant's conception of science teaching during the preservice year? What changes occurred in the conceptions of these beginning science teachers, during postgraduation independent teaching? and, Do any patterns which are consistent across the cases emerge from the data? The participants were six science graduates who completed the same one-year postgraduate teacher education course and gained employment in a secondary school the following year.  Three types of data were elicited at each of four points in time; the methods used were a concept map of 'science teaching', a  repertory   grid  based on ' good' and 'poor' teachers of science, and a stimulated recall interview based on the videotape of a lesson taught by the participant.  The components of each participant's conception that were investigated were their views of the teacher, the student, science and the teaching/learning process. The study found a variety of initial conceptions amongst the participants, but various degrees of internal consistency were also apparent. Changes in participants' conceptions of science teaching during the preservice year varied considerably. Those who initially held more constructivist views had generally moderated their view to a more transmissive one at the end of that year, whilst those whose views were more transmissive had generally moved to a more constructivist or process-oriented perspective. During postgraduation teaching greater consistency was generally achieved, and all participants expressed more elaborated constructivist conceptions of science teaching. Apparent trends across the cases included links between individuals' views of the roles of teacher and student and of science and the teaching/learning process. Strongly held initial conceptions tended to persist, though other conceptions underwent reconstruction. Data suggested that transition difficulties to independent teaching may depend partly on the contrast between school settings encountered in the preservice year and in the first postgraduation year of teaching. These results have implications for preservice education and induction of beginning science teachers.

%X The program was administered in science laboratories during junior science or biological science classes to prevent interruption to the daily routine within the college. Students in years eight, nine, eleven and twelve in a Catholic college for girls were the subjects of the study. The program was administered before the end of semester examinations in May and repeated for the year twelve students in November. The progressive relaxation and desentisation program was evaluated using four instruments.  The major instrument was a  repertory   grid  developed for the subjects involved in the study and used to measure assessment anxiety.  Self-concept was measured using the 'Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale', locus of control using the 'Crandall Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire' and academic achievement using semester assessment scores. The repertory grids were examined and validated using Rasch analysis. This technique was used to examine the validity of the constructs in the grid for the subjects in this study. Differences between patterns of responses for experimental and control groups' repertory grids were observed.  Rasch analysis has not been previously reported in the literature for examination of  repertory   grid  data.   Analysis of variance on  repertory   grid  scores indicated significant differences between the levels of anxiety between assessment elements for experimental and control groups across all four year levels taken separately and combined.  The assessment elements essay and calculations evoked the highest levels of assessment anxiety for the assessment elements studied. This finding will be of particular interest to educators when designing assessment programs. Significant differences were also demonstrated for the year twelve students for the other three instruments and a significant positive relationship was confirmed between self-concept and semester assessment for groups in years eight and nine. The relaxation and desensitisation program appears to have manifested a number of positive effects at all four year levels; however, there did not appear to be a long-term effect demonstrated by any of the experimental groups in November, six months after the administration of the program.

%X This study explores the intrinsic relationships between the personal constructs of teaching and learning that trainee language teachers bring to their formal teacher education study. The analysis represents an effort to look, from a cultural constructivist perspective, at the subjective educational ideology of trainee language teachers in Singapore. Subjective educational ideologies are grounded in the personal history of trainee involvement in both formal and informal educative cultures. This study demonstrates that it is possible to augment advances in understanding previously gained through research by examining those individuals and cultures that have principally and directly influenced the thinking and learning of the trainee: teachers, parents, family members, peers and schools.  Repertory   grid  and self characterisation written biographies, it is argued, provide a hermeneutic dialectic approach to cultural constructivist inquiry.  These techniques are synergistic and ideally suited to the purpose of exploring trainee teacher thinking and underlying ideology. Analysis of the data indicates that trainee teachers from different cultures, and educated in different mother tongues, display a range of intrinsic constructs about language learning, language teaching pedagogy, and language teacher characteristics. These trainees, upon entering a formal professional preparatory program, display a knowledge about the language teacher's personal and interpersonal skills and their role in creating an environment that facilitates language learning. Trainee knowledge and constructs about language teaching and learning are grounded in their personal history. That is, both informal and formal experiences of language, teaching and learning environments affect the development of subjective educational ideology. These ideological principles form the foundation of trainee language teacher thinking and are more closely associated with elements from the informal educative culture of the home, that is, with one or both parents. Furthermore, the closeness of these associations suggests that this group of trainees validated these culturally influenced, personal constructs of language teaching and learning against elements from their formal education. The trainees' preferred approach to language teaching was found to reflect the way they learned language in the context of the home.

%X One ecological aspect of relevance in improving efficacy in special education is the role of the parent of a child with a disability. This study compares the constructions of two groups, parents living with a child with a hearing impairment (HI) and parents living with a non disabled child (ND).  The research question was investigated using group  repertory   grid   technique  based on a theoretical framework comprising personal construct theory, family systems theory and educational ecology theory.  The research followed a respondent driven grid protocol. Therefore the literature review was not used to determine the variables to be investigated but to establish a need for the study and to show how meaningful results would be obtained. Two research guidelines were formulated: to solve methodological problems by referring to the theoretical framework and to construe parents as partners in the research. To explain parental adaptation to having a deaf child, research literature findings were examined within the five nested developmental contexts of the 'integrative social systems perspective' model. The research design followed a hierarchical structure for the development of research hypotheses. There were seven levels of inquiry, beginning at level 1 the research question. Only if a particular level was successfully defended did the research progress to examine the next higher level. In level 2 three grids were developed from information provided by 31 HI parents during a semistructured interview. At level 3 these grids were administered to the same HI parents to 29 ND parents. At level 4 the data were analysed by descriptive and high inference contrasts using means, standard deviations and total mean t ratios. Test procedures involving factor analysis, analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance were conducted as part of the speculative and low inference comparisons at level 5. Further explorations were conducted using stepwise discriminant analysis at level 6. At level 7 seven clarification criteria were used to examine the collated results.

%X This case study examines a development program conducted for nursing staff development consultants in a public hospital.  Repertory   grid  technology was used to identify role functions and participants' attitudes, values and beliefs about their role; this provided a basis for the further program processes of facilitated reflection and conversation.  The central research interests were the program approach, which was founded in personal construct theory, and the recently developed consultant role. Data were collected from all involved, in order to portray the program, and repertory grids were repeated, to identify change. The program processes were found to be well accepted and productive, resulting in individual and group development initiatives, strategies for organisational change, and team building. Insights were gained into the power of grids and the need for sensitive use in the workplace; limitations in the use of followup grids were identified. Repertory grid's particular value was as a conversational tool. Further insights related to the potential for tension as well as for congruence between personal and organisational needs. Acceptance of the adult learning concepts of learner control and the relativity of knowledge was seen as inherent in a constructivist approach. The staff development consultant role was found to be challenging and functional. The study provided direction for further research in staff development and constructivist approaches.

%X The purpose of this paper is to present a theoretical framework for action learning and action research for better understanding and improving university learning and teaching. Action research is conceived as a philosophy, a theory of learning, a methodology and a technique. The philosophy includes theories of action, critical theory and personal construct theory. The learning theory encompasses adult learning, experiential learning and double-loop learning. The methodology is based in the dialectical epistemology and the non-positivist paradigm.  Examples of action research as a technique are the nominal group technique, the  repertory   grid   technique  and other tools aiding reflection and group discussion.  It is concluded that action research not only advances knowledge, but also improves practice in higher education by. developing people as professionals and "personal scientists", and organisations as "learning organisations".

Repertory   grid  methodology was employed to inform the process of discourse development.  A model of the five interrelated systems of events or issues that impinge upon the perceptions of parents of children with an intellectual disability is proposed. In addition, details about the group's perceptions of those environmental events or issues that are pertinent to living with and caring for a child with an intellectual disability are reported.

%X This study involved the development, implementation and evaluation of a constructivist learning model based on Kelly's (1955) personal construct psychology. The thesis begins with a rationale for the use of personal construct psychology and then the instructional approach is derived from this theoretical basis. Following the derivation, examples of learning materials used in the implementation are presented. The second half of the thesis deals with data gathered before, during and after the implementation which occurred in two Year 9 science classes. The classes were part of a city high school in Western Australia. Evaluation of the approach was conducted using a variety of methods. Students' science knowledge was assessed using a science test.  Other techniques such as  repertory   grid  methodology, interviews about events, questions about events, a questionnaire about beliefs to do with energy, and phenomenological classroom observations were also used to determine the effect of the implementation upon the students and teachers involved.  Data gathered, often qualitative in nature, provided a rich description of the effect of the implementation. Results from the two classes undergoing the implementation were compared to one other class that was taught the same content in the traditional manner. Results showed that students from the constructivist classroom learnt the school science as well as students taught with traditional methods. The results also showed that the constructivist approach resulted in the translation of formal school science into personal knowledge of students, with this knowledge being mostly scientifically correct. Additionally, these students became cognitively more complex individuals. Differences in the manner in which the two teachers implemented the constructivist learning approach had a significant effect on student learning outcomes. The thesis concludes with many implications to arise from the study and some suggestions of future research directions.

%K Parent needs 
%X Parents of children with intellectual disability objected to service providers either inferring their needs from studies of other parents or believing that they could identify needs more objectively than the parents themselves. They asked for assistance, however, in expressing their needs. A review of parent studies illustrated limits of simple models of both the impact on parents of their children and effects on parents of services, and difficulties in predicting in parent's needs from group trends. It was concluded that needs assessment should be parent centred and multivariate. The notion that scientific procedures could guarantee more objective assessment of needs than would be achieved by focusing on parents' view was rejected on the grounds that truth is constructed, not revealed.  This position was aligned with Kelly's (1955) philosophy of constructive alternativism, and his  repertory   grid  methodology was adopted for assessing parents' construals of their needs.  It was modified in order to support their expression, and to provide group data required for planning of services. Results indicate that expression was supported, the needs of the parents individually tended not to be predictable, and the parents were generally more positive than negative about caring for their children. It was found that a needs profile of the overall group represented individuals less well than subgroup profiles. It was suggested that instead of seeking a single point of best compromise between group and individual data, the decision should take account of the nature of services being provided. The needs assessment procedure is offered for use, and improvement, by others. It is recommended that needs assessment and provision of services should focus on parents' views.

%X This study centred on social work educators' and students' constructions of classroom teaching and learning. Education for social work practice has been reconceptualised as involving nothing less than the critical retheorising of teaching and learning. It has been argued that there is no firm foundation for social work educational, and that one is unlikely to emerge.  The study used George Kelly's theory of personal constructs and his  repertory   grid  to show how classroom teaching and learning in social work educational have been constructed, both on an individual and a collective basis.  In a subsequent move, teaching and learning were deconstructed using a particular set of analytical strategies developed by Jacques Derrida (1976, 1981b), namely: reversal and displacement. The study has provided a preliminary set of practices which could be used in a poststructuralist pedagogy. A total of eight educators and ten students in the graduate degree program offered by the Department of Social Work and Social Policy at the University of Queensland took part in the study. The participants provided information relating to personal and academic background and the ways in which they construed classroom practices. Teaching and learning grids were elicited from, fed back to, and interpreted by, each participant. These grids were subjected to principal component analysis, and were used to reveal differences and similarities in and between the educators' and students' personal constructions of teaching and learning. The students were also engaged in the process of reviewing their constructions over the duration of the course. Consequent changes and continuities in students' individual constructions of teaching and learning were carefully monitored and thoroughly discussed as they moved through social work education. All of the teaching and learning grids produced by the study participants were further analysed using Sociogrids. The resultant social work education grid made it possible to take account of the social construction of teaching and learning. The particular approaches taken in this study have provided an alternative perspective on how classroom teaching and learning have been practised in social work education. It has been argued that social work education constitutes a thoroughly historical and political enterprise. It was further argued that constructions of educational practice must be perpetually deconstructed, and that the stultifying effects of the structuralist paradigm which currently dominates social work education could be countered by the introduction of poststructuralist educational practices.

%X The process of teaching and learning lies at the very heart of education. The more one knows about this process, the better one will be able to influence its growth and direction. The attempt to better understand the teaching and learning process has traditionally been dominated by behaviourist and positivist research paradigms. It is possible to augment advances previously made by examining how those who are principally and directly involved in the process of teaching and learning - that is, teachers and students - think as well as behave.  Autobiography and  repertory   grid , it is argued, are two methods ideally suited to the purpose of elucidating the perspectives of teachers and students.

%X The overall aim of the research was to begin the reconciliation of school leavers' expectations about work with those of their employers, so that all the actors involved in the transition from school to work would be more comfortable in their interactions, and to stimulate the stakeholders' thinking about the necessary inputs required to lead to the outcomes of effectiveness in these entry level workers. The objectives of the study were: to explore the expectations that school leavers had of work: to ascertain which helping agents were considered helpful in preparing school leavers to work effectively; to explore the similarities and differences between the groups of school leavers, new recruits, experienced recruits and supervisors (as the employers' representatives) in their construings of the first 12 selected activities that could be considered helpful in preparing the school leaver to work more effectively; and to investigate strategies to bridge the gap between new recruits and supervisors in their understandings of each others' points of view about the second 12 selected activities that could assist new recruits to become effective clerical workers. Final year secondary school students were surveyed initially to explore their knowledge and expectations about work.  Structured questionnaires and  repertory   grid  technology were utilised in further interviews with school leavers, recruits and supervisors.  Mode grids and case studies were developed to identify the critical points in the transition from school to work, at which training was considered essential to the survival of the school leaver in the workforce. The study showed that the process of becoming an effective worker was a multifaceted one and that there was one fundamental component which must be present, otherwise the new recruit could be in danger of becoming a disillusioned or terminated employee. This fundamental component was the assertion of the supervisors that if school leavers did not have the required basic behaviours and attitudes before they came to the organisation, no amount of training could make an effective worker of them. They would exit the organisation or remain within the organisation as an apathetic, ineffective worker. Implications ensuing from the findings of the study and of interest to certain stakeholders - the education system, government bodies and industry - in transition from school to work are outlined in the study.

It was predicted that the self-concepts of the dyslexic students would be more negative than the self- concepts of the non- dyslexic students and that there would be a greater discrepancy between the self constructions and the ideal self constructions of the dyslexic group than of the non- dyslexic group. Results are examined.

%X This program of research examined the process of transition from being a practitioner in a field to becoming an educator in the same field.  The initial study used  repertory   grid   technique  and a longitudinal methodology.  A total intake of Technical and Further Education (TAFE) beginning teachers was followed throughout their two year preparation program. At five intervals, six months apart, repertory grids were administered to the group with the elements supplied relating to various roles and aspects of the self, relevant to transition. Constructs elicited from the group mapped the transition process during the two year period, and showed the changing emphasis over the course.  A content analysis was also carried out on the constructs elicited and results showed support for the  repertory   grid  data.  Measurements of self esteem and the effect of the transition on family relationships were also taken.

%X This study examines the history teacher's role in construing and enacting an innovative way of teaching the subject to first year secondary (or Secondary One) students in schools in Singapore. The teacher's response to curricular change is examined from the perspective of the individual teacher. The five teachers who participated in the main study formed the data source. A variety of methods was used. The emphasis was on the exploration and elaboration of the individual teacher's construction and enactment of his or her role in curricular change and how that role changed over time.  The  repertory   grid  employed in the main study was designed so that teachers construed the experiences associated with their roles as History teachers.  The grid was elicited from the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the main study. As the grid was elicited on two occasions, it served as a repeated measure on which to structure the sequence of report and reflection that all five teachers engaged in with the researcher over a period of two terms (ie. from January-May, 1988). In addition, other data collection methods were chosen that complemented this emphasis on the individual and the extent of change. Each teacher was asked at the beginning of the main study to write about his or her work and explain how s/he planned lessons for Secondary One History students. After trialling the innovative materials for a period of one term, each teacher was asked to complete an open-ended questionnaire on teacher beliefs, planning and actions. The teacher was also given an opportunity to evaluate the innovative mode of practice. The teacher was also given an opportunity to evaluate the innovative mode of practice. Additional data in the form of transcipts of interviews and classroom teaching were available to the researcher. The data provided by the study support the belief that teachers can make or break an innovation since they control implementation.

%X This paper focuses on methodological questions arising during a study into the way teachers think and behave in the classroom management domain.  Multiple data sources included classroom management ordered trees, classroom management beliefs questionnaire,  repertory   grid , journals and stimulated recall interviews.  In a study of the content, structure and meaning of the teachers' classroom management schemata the appropriateness of each of these instruments is considered. As the schemata were analysed in both extensive and intensive phases of the study the appropriateness of the instrument of each of these phases is also considered. The paper reports results for the student teachers' classroom management schemata. The focus in this paper is on issues involved in: the development of a coding system for analysing the data; the identification of differences in classroom management schemata across and within different groups of student teachers; and the identification of transition points in the student teachers develoment of their classroom management schemata. The coding system was developed to analyse and compare data from each of the multiple data gathering sources used in the study. The discussion of the coding system includes the conceptual basis for the system, the data analysis procedures and the reliability of the data. The relationships between the categories used for each of the three dimensions of schemata (content, structure and meaning) are discussed. The data resented is also related to the development of a classroom management observation system (CMOS) for the study of relationships between teacher management schemata and behaviours.

%X The purpose of the study was to design curricula for practicum to improve the quality fo student experiences. The study describes factors which influence practicum experiences of 30 student teachers, such as institution settings of the placement, curriculum of the practicum, student disposition and those with whom they interact, based on the work of Zeichner (1980), Fuller and Brown (1975), Katz (1982) and Fielding (1983).  Change measures were based on student self report and coded using Kelly's (1955) 'personal construct'  repertory   grid  with eight elements.  Construct dimensions were developed from audiotape transcripts and scored on a scale of 1 to 5 on three separate occasions during the practicum. Research findings suggest that there are special characteristics in early childhood teaching, and that the content and context of practicum experiences need to be matched with a sequence of role-related experiences, particularly for capable teacher education students seeking challenges in the practicum placement.

A comparison was also made of children's perceptions of the hospital school and their more regular mode of schooling. From data obtained, areas of concern relating to children's interactions with aspects of the hospital environment were highlighted. This will enable programs to be implemented which will aid the physiologicl, psychological, social and educational development of the hospitalised child.

%X This thesis is a critique of the  Repertory   Grid   Technique  as a method suitable for use by teachers in the conduct of self evaluation.  Three home economics teachers in Western suburban schools were used as case studies.  By using the  Repertory   Grid   Technique  the phenomena of teachers' practice emerge through a matrix built up by descriptions of classroom practice with stated intentions of purposes for such practice.  The matrix provides a structured mode for observation of teacher practice while also allowing for some quantifying of results without being empiricist in nature. Through procedural sequencing of the practice of teaching (elements) with the intentions (constructs) the methodology can substantiate the purposes of a teacher from the basis of their actions and behaviour in the classroom. The process bases its mode on the belief than an individual's theoretical knowledge is not separate from knowledge gained through the experiences of practice.  Finally, the thesis relates the applicability of a  Repertory   Grid   Technique  to the professional autonomy and accountability of teachers within Hoyle's definition of 'extended accountability'.

%X The purpose of this paper is to introduce a research methodology in higher education which enables us to elicit personal theories of several aspects of higher education, for example research, teaching, learning and professional development. It is an alternative to the traditional methods of studying people's perceptions and perspectives, for example by questionnaire, interview or structured group discussion. It is important for anyone involved in effecting change in people, be they students or staff who want to learn and develop their knowledge and skills, to investigate the current state of the learner and to help him or her to articulate personal theories, to compare them with those of others, to negotiate their meaning, and to revise them continually.

%X The cognitions of seven mothers were contrasted using Kelly's psychology of personal constructs. on the basis of how successfully they learned and applied the skills of modifying their children's uncooperative behaviour, the mothers were grouped as successful or unsuccessful.  Before and after the training, each completed a fixed format  repertory   grid  which consisted of 14 parent-role descriptions and 16 child-rearing statements.  Adopting each role perspective in turn, the mothers indicated how much sense they could make of each statement. The extracted and FOCUS-ed mode grids showed that, while the successful mothers rejected swatting and punishment and came to consider themselves as less hassled and less like the mothers of rule-breaking children than before the intervention, the construing of the unsuccessful mothers remained almost unchanged except that they came to feel even more like the mothers of rule-breaking children. While the successful mothers construed encouragement in terms of control practices, the unsuccessful pair saw it in terms of children's self-reliance and independence. A behaviour modification program may be effective only if parents can be helped to accept and embed its offered constructs within their own construct systems.

%X This case study discusses some staff and students' personal constructs of research effectiveness.  A  repertory   grid  form (Kelly, 1955) and associated computer programs (Shaw, 1980) were used as alternative instruments to the traditional questionnaire for evaluating the criteria for effective research held by six university staff and six postgraduate students.   The results are reported and it is suggested that the  repertory   grid   technique  is a powerful heuristic tool in higher education to aid people in construing their theories in action and to negotiate their personal meanings.

%X A Personal Construct Theory (PCT) approach was adopted to investigate the education of college based nursing students and graduates. Previous Australian research was reviewed. The nature of college nursing courses was discussed, and it was argued that a study of college nurses constructs in nursing was needed. The research design entailed a descriptive, phenomenological, cross sectional approach. Sixty one participants were divided into a matched entry group (N equals 20), an exit group (N equals 21), and a graduate group (N equals 20).  The methods employed included a  Repertory   Grid  Form in which ten constructs were elicited; two were constructs supplied for ideal and actual nursing.  Twelve elements that represented nursing activities were rated between 1 - 5. Main conclusions were drawn. Constructs became more interrelated as participants progressed through the college nursing course. All three groups clustered nursing activities which could be interpreted as medically oriented tasks, or problem solving. The medically oriented and problem solving tasks were described by the entry and graduate groups as patient related. The exit group employed theoretical concepts as descriptions for these tasks. Professional activities tended to be contrasted with patient centred ones. Priority ratings for actual and ideal nursing were significantly more congruent for the entry and exit groups than for the graduates.

Whilst the use of the  repertory   grid , as a means of investigating teacher and student thinking, has attracted a growing following of users, its use has also generated some debate about the potential of the grid to enhance perspectives on teaching.  This paper argues that the problem lies in the interpretation of the grid and the extent to which the subjects of research are involved in that process of interpretation.

%X This paper discusses how computer programs, such as FOCUS and SOCIOGRIDS, can aid students and staff in learning about their own formerly tacit perceptions of research effectiveness. The programs are designed to elicit and analyse ones own construct system and theory of, for example, learning, teaching, or research. The computer printout can be used to facilitate learning conversations either with oneself or with others. A greater awareness and understanding of ones own theory and that of expert others can lead to improved learning, teaching or research.

%X This research identified, through the use of pairwise similarity judgements and a  repertory   grid  methodology, the dimensions of meaning individuals use in discriminating among natural settings, and the relationship of these dimensions to aesthetic response.  Randomly selected photographic stimuli were presented to 52 subjects in an experimental setting, using a micro-computer to control presentation of stimuli and tasks. Five dimensions of meaning were identified, with subjects differentially weighting these dimensions in terms of their salience to aesthetic response. It is argued that although the collative properties of experimentally derived stimuli are important in modifying arousal levels (Berlyne, 1971), when investigating "environments" and not "stimuli", the perceived meaning or ecological properties (Berlyne, 1971) are additional and important determinants of aesthetic response.

%K Fixed role treatment 
%X Kelly's (1955) theoretical constructs were applied in the design and implementation of a program of Fixed Role Treatment in which a teacher educator sought to subsume the personal construct systems of 15 experienced teachers. Fresh construct avenues were set out in alternative teaching scenarios.  These roles were devised to be quite different from those ascribed to each teacher on the basis of their  repertory   grid  delineations of the teacher I am and pupils.  The teachers adopted their roles as fully as possible for 10 consecutive teaching days and then repeated the grid. The FOCUS program analysed each grid to present tree diagrams for the elements and constructs and SOCIOGRIDS compared each teachers pre and post test grids to produce a measure of similarity. A mode grid was also extracted for the whole group on each occasion. Considerable movement was indicated and pupils came to be construed much more positively. Though the effects of suggestion are difficult to isolate, most of the teachers attributed increased feelings of potency and self contact to their role enactments.

%X The report describes a small scale research project which investigated the experiences and perceptions of three former students of the Introductory Trades Course for Young Women program. These courses, provided by the South Australian Department of Technical and Further Education were aimed at introducing young women to traditionally male apprentice based vocations. The purpose of the research was to provide TAFE staff with some case study information that would contribute to their provision of educational opportunities in non traditional vocations.  The approach selected to elicit the students' views was based on George Kelly's 'Theory of Personal Constructs and  Repertory   Grid'  (1955).  A response to the students' perceptions presented in Section 3 was sought from those staff within the Department and the TAFE colleges who had experience and responsibilities in the area of trade education. These are presented in Section 4 of the report. The concluding section of the report identifies some research issues, including possible future fields of inquiry.

%X In the previous paper, Teacher Knowledge Part 1; Unstopping the Dam, the suggestion was made that a methodology based on Personal Construct Theory (PCT) could be used to explore and develop a new model of teacher professional development prepared by Fielding (1983). Two questions were asked. What is this methodology? How can it be used to explore and develop Fielding's model? The second question was dealt with in the earlier paper. The first is the subject of this paper.  The intention here is threefold; firstly, to describe the theory of personal constructs, originated by Kelly (1955) and elaborated by Fransella and Bannister (1971) second to discuss the preparation and analysis of repertory grids, a procedure stemming from the theory conceived by Kelly (1955, 1961) and again elaborated by Fransella and Bannister (1977); finally to consider some of the measures used in and interpretations made of  repertory   grid  analyses.

%X The paper presents an ideographic research approach that is being developed to describe the career biographies of individual teachers. These 'portrayals' were seen as a means for exploring the notion of professional development and the personal and contextual conditions that bear upon it.  Interviews, together with a variation on the  repertory   grid   technique , were used with two experienced teachers as the means for constructing their phenomenological life-worlds.  Implications for in-service education policies and strategies are drawn from the case studies, and a case is presented for the importance of developing models of teacher development complementary to models of curriculum innovation.

%X This study begins by reviewing the literature on childhood depression covering a range of definitions, conceptual models, and methodological issues. Current research is outlined and the present status of the concept of depression in childhood is examined. The study then turns to an analysis of four children identified as being highly depressed.  A  repertory   grid  approach is used to elicit constructs pertaining to each child's phenomenological environment, and the four grids are then subjected to a principal components analysis.  In this manner, the social context of each child's depression is uncovered and is then explored in terms of the psychodynamic theories outlined. Suggestions for treatment strategies and further research are made.

%X This research examines the nature of teacher perceptions of their students, the associations between these and teacher behaviours in the classroom, and the promotion of change in teacher perceptions and behaviours through an intervention.  The Kelly  Repertory   Grid   technique  was used to investigate teachers' perceptions of students.  The Brophy-Good Dyadic Scheme was used to gather classroom observation data. These data, derived from approximately 100 hours of interviews and observations, provided the basis for an intervention followed by further interviews and observations. The research sample comprised nine female, primary school teachers. The results indicated that there were few associations between teacher perceptions of students and classroom behaviours, and suggest that whilst teachers perceived students in different ways, their behaviours towards them were influenced by other features of the classroom environment. The data showed that teachers responded positively to the intervention procedure and were successful, in varying degrees, in changing their teaching behaviours.

%X This study proposes that a major coupling mechanism in schools is the decision making relationship that links organisation roles and organisation functions. There is evidence that role ambiguity, conflict and stress exist in school situations but few studies probe the decision making role of the teacher in relation to school functions. The principle of hierarchical decision making may not be applied strictly in schools. Who does share in decision making and who should share is an open question. Hypotheses were developed relating to the perceptions of the teacher in relation to school decision making.  A modification of the  repertory   grid   technique  was used to investigate these hypotheses.  The results were found to have implications for school planning. A number of strategies for change were suggested.

It discusses the need for an instrument which will sensitively measure aspects of teacher personality, and monitor changes which occur over time, especially as a consequence of inservice training programs.  The method section describes how the  repertory   grid  methodology was used with teachers at a suburban primary school, and includes an outline of the grid development, and its analysis using the INGRID Principal Components Computer Program.  The results section contains profiles of each teacher, built up from the computer analysis, and also includes data which shows how the teachers were categorised into certain groups.
