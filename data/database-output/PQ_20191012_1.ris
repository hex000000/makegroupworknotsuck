T1  - Gendered career paths
AN  - 214802978
AB  - Starting from the viewpoint that career is a gender concept, the author suggests that organizational culture is a key determinant in relation to career paths, fostering success for men, and difficulty for women. Four case study organizations were investigated using repertory grid interviews with men and women managers, group discussions, and documentary evidence. In each case the organizational background, and traditional and current career paths are described, with comments on the extend to which these could be negotiated by women. Respondents outlined what is valued in managers in terms of characteristics and behavior in their respective organizations. All these aspects are linked to the key assumptions underlying each organizational culture. In 3 out of the 4 organizations women faced serious difficulties. Only in NHS Trust with a female chief executive was there close congruity between culture and style, and career paths open to all.

T1  - Primary and secondary store-loyal customer perceptions of grocery retailers
AN  - 225143323
AB  - Gaining competitive advantage in retailing requires knowledge of the attributes consumers use to evaluate stores and an understanding of why these attributes are important. Although a number of store-image studies have identified store attributes, evidence suggests that these attributes vary by store type and over time, but no work has considered the most crucial aspects to retailers, namely store loyalty. As no study has examined the links between store attributes and store loyalty, the knowledge remains largely speculative. This article explores this link using Kelly's repertory grid methodology to assess the store images of three UK grocery retailers. Important differences were seen between primary store-loyal customers' perception of their store and secondary store-loyal customers' perception of that store. Implications for retail positioning strategies and the development of store loyalty are discussed.

T1  - How Tutors Model Students: A Study of Personal Constructs in Adaptive Tutoring
AN  - 1986936326
AB  - Studies of tutoring are producing rich descriptions of tutorial dialogue but have not                identified constructs that tutors use to classify and discriminate among students for                the purpose of adapting tutoring to student differences. This study investigated five                experienced tutors' personal constructs about students tutored over a significant                period of time. Several tutoring settings and domains were represented. Constructs                used by tutors to discriminate among tutees were identified with repertory grid                interviews and interpreted with the aid of cluster analysis. All tutors judged and                classified students in terms of two underlying dimensions that were similarly                defined, though not exactly alike, across tutors: motivation and intellectual                ability. Tutors' personal constructs and tutorial decisions informed by those                constructs are reported, and implications for programming computer-based tutors are                discussed.

   While there is no "correct" map, analysing the map produced by each individual will give an expert a good idea of what the level of understanding each individual has on that particular topic, she says. Dr Stewart says the software is based on a technique called repertory grid interview, initially developed by an American engineer called George Kelly in 1930.

T1  - Images of a culture in transition: Personal constructs of organizational stability and change
AN  - 199401329; 01501351; 03392227
AB  - An investigation was undertaken in a large government business enterprise in a bid to examine the utility of the repertory grid technique in the investigation of organizational culture and to conduct an "audit" of performance culture.  The development of a methodology is described to gauge the rate of up-take of a new culture - from a public service orientation towards a customer service orientation.  Schein's (1990) theoretical framework was adopted in developing a 2-stage approach to the collection of data, which incorporated qualitative (in-depth interviews), and quantitative (survey) methods.  Results indicated that there was progress in the direction of the new culture desired by management.  There were 3 active cultures or groupings, articulated through the language of participants, which essentially mirrored a culture transition: those who had adopted the new culture, those who had partially adopted the new culture, and those who had not adopted the new culture.

T1  - "In the Eye of the Beholder": A New Approach to Studying Folk Theories of Leadership
AN  - 2181259982
AB  - Awareness that questionnaire ratings of leaders may be subject to systematic errors has led to increased emphasis on understanding the perceptual/memory processes underlying leadership ratings. Subordinates may judge leadership effectiveness based on their implicit leadership theories. Folk theories of leadership refers to these deeply felt and idiosyncratic theories of leadership behaviors. Borman's (1983) "Trait-Implication Procedure" based on Kelly's Repertory Grid technique was used to examine the leadership categorization schema of ten senior executives from a wide variety of organizations. Results indicate some association between the folk theories of leadership and the background/experience of the respondent. Implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.

T1  - Behaviours in organization: Chinese world views and perceptions of cross-cultural differences. A study of Hong Kong Chinese working in Canada
AN  - 304389526
AB  - This study inquired into the lived experience of the Hong Kong Chinese in Canada and captured snapshots of their perceptions of cross-cultural differences in organizational behaviour. To provide a base for study, I examined literature on organizational behaviour from the cross-cultural and the Chinese dimensions. To conceptualise how people perceive the world, I reviewed literature on the personal-construct theory and the schema theory.    The study used a qualitative mode of enquiry, with the researcher as an instrument to collect data through the in-depth interview and the repertory-grid methods. The participants, 8 men and 2 women, were either degree-holders or professionals with work experience in the service sectors in both Hong Kong and Canada. The study extracted their world views, which shape their interpretation of reality, from their narratives and work experience in both cultures. I identified 7 meta-narratives shaping the unique world view that differentiate them from Canadians at work; these meta-narratives dealt with: existence, achievement, work, conflict, power, relationship and communication. I also identified 4 major dimensions in modus operandi between these two cultures: planning, cooperation, leadership and controlling.    I adopted the phenomenological-hermeneutic approach to analyse and thematise the data collected through interviews. I also explored through the repertory-grid method the participants' constructs of the role-holders in organizations between these two cultures. The grid data were computed by the Focus programme. These two sets of results were compared and triangulated to increase the study's academic rigour.    The evidence shows that the Chinese perceived significant differences between themselves and Canadians in many dimensions of organizational behaviour. These differences obviously reflected these 2 cultures' underlining meta-narratives--the Chinese perceived Canadians as self-rather than organization-oriented, over-optimistic and carefree, uncommitted assertive, equalitarian, too frank and straightforward competitive in dealing with conflicts and intolerant to inequality. Clearly, their cultural perspective creates difficulty for Chinese working in Canada and Canadians or Western management specialists and educators attempting to work in Chinese societies.    The study concludes with implications for practice for people who work across the cultural line with Chinese, with recommendations on ways to enhance cultural understanding, and with directions for further research.

T1  - The Goldilocks pursuit in organizational selection: How recruiters form and use judgments of person-organization fit
AN  - 304350948
AB  - The Goldlilocks Pursuit describes recruiters' attempts to hire applicants who are "just right" for their companies. Judgments of "just right" include recruiters' perceptions of an applicant's person-job (P-J) and person-organization (P-O) fit. P-J fit has been the traditional focus of selection research, but P-O fit has only recently been investigated as a factor in hiring decisions.    Two studies were conducted to answer remaining questions regarding recruiters' P-O fit perceptions. A qualitative methodology was used in Study One to determine what types of characteristics recruiters use to assess applicants' P-O fit, and how similar these characteristics are across organizations. Thirty-two recruiters from four consulting organizations completed repertory grid interviews (Kelly, 1955) in which they compared video-taped job applicants to determine who had the best P-J and P-O fit. Results indicate both unique and shared predictors of fit perceptions, with more skill and experience characteristics leading to judgments of P-J fit, and more personality and value characteristics relating to P-O fit perceptions. Many recruiters used idiosyncratic preferences to determine both types of fit; however, there was also support for organization-specific and universally desirable characteristics influencing fit perceptions.    Structural equations modeling was used in Study Two to determine the relative effects of P-O fit, P-J fit, applicant-recruiter similarity, and liking on recruiters' hiring recommendations. Recruiters from two organizations evaluated 80 applicants during a regular recruiting cycle. Results indicate that perceptions of P-J and P-O fit are highly related, but are predicted by somewhat distinct characteristics. P-J fit perceptions were the best predictor of hiring recommendations, although P-O fit perceptions were also significant predictors. Results also suggest that perceptions of P-O fit mediate the relationship between perceived applicant-recruiter similarity and hiring recommendations better than does recruiters' liking of the applicants.    Together, these studies provide a comprehensive examination of how recruiters form and use impressions of applicants' P-O fit during the selection process. Implications for improving assessments of fit and how they are used in conjunction with other evaluations of applicants to increase the overall effectiveness of the hiring process intended to find the applicants whose fit is "just right" are included.

T1  - Team performance: using repertory grid technique to gain a view from the inside
AN  - 217098014
AB  - Measuring team performance through use of repertory grid technique is novel; it appears to have some advantages over the use of conventional questionnaires and inventories. Once a set of constructs relevant to a particular team's circumstances is generated, it can be used at regular intervals to measure changes in team performance. A particular set of constructs, though, may have a limited life. As the purpose and processes of a team change, the constructs relevant to that team's performance may need to change with new sets of constructs identified, using the same technique as before. Thus the method of measuring team performance is dynamic, keeping pace with changes in the team itself.

AB  - Numerous computerized repertory grid programs are available to researchers and clinicians; however, these programs operate in a DOS environment, and many are cumbersome to use.  Baldwin et al introduce the first Windows-based repertory grid program, making the analysis of repertory grids easier and thus more useful for researchers and practitioners in the behavioral sciences.

T1  - Drivers' risk assessments and their impact on seat belt use
AN  - 213757331; 01318524
AB  - The repertory grid technique is used as the main research instrument for eliciting drivers' knowledge to explore the factors that have impact on seat belt use.  Principal components analysis identified 5 factors underlying drivers' risk assessments: severity, predictability/foreseeability, fault, frequency/unsafe behavior, and hit/air bag impact.  The results show that the perceived risk and perceived importance of seat belt use are influenced by situational factors: the direction of collision, the location of collision, and the existence of an air bag system.  The implication is that belt use campaigns might be more successful if they focused on modifying perceived risk.

T1  - Understanding the basis of treatment choices for varicose veins: a model for decision making with the repertory grid technique.
AN  - 1770033679
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use the repertory grid technique as a method for identifying and rating the criteria that clinicians use to make a choice between the different treatment options for patients with a common condition such as varicose veins. DESIGN: The "expert panel" consensus method for rating the appropriateness of clinical procedures was modified with an existing psychometric method, the repertory grid technique. To identify the criteria used to decide about treatment, the panel members compared and contrasted a range of nine "treatment prototypes". They were then required to rate each criterion for its relevance to each treatment prototype. SETTING: The panel was selected from different geographical locations in the South Western Regional Health Authority. SUBJECTS: The expert panel was composed of six vascular surgeons, three from teaching and three from non-teaching hospitals; two general practitioners who were also clinical assistants in vascular surgery; and one honorary senior lecturer in general practice. MAIN MEASURES: Decision making criteria were categorised according to their content. Their frequency of replication was noted-that is, how many clinicians used the same criterion. Computer analysis of the rating scores for the nine panel members identified the relative importance of each treatment criterion for each treatment option. RESULTS: 161 criteria for the treatment of varicose veins were elicited from the nine participants. These criteria were wide ranging, from clinical indications (48% of those used), to social (32%), and organisational factors (20%). Clinical indications were more likely to be used when deciding about surgery as a high priority, whereas social and organisational criteria were more likely to be applied in decisions about surgery as a low priority, day case surgery, and cosmetic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The repertory grid technique proved to be effective in modelling decision making for a condition such as varicose veins: its use enabled both the identification of the wide range of criteria underlying the decision to treat and the exploration of the relative importance of these criteria in relation to several treatment options. Its potential as a method for reducing variation in clinical decision making and thus improving distribution of high quality care lies in its ability to pinpoint dilemmas of decision making rather than as the basis for drawing up guidelines to regulate decision making practice.

T1  - Cognitive maps in the analysis of personal change during work role transition
AN  - 229485014; 01204592
AB  - The way in which personal construct psychology and repertory grids can be used to produce cognitive maps is illustrated, and psychological adjustment during the transition from college to employment is analyzed.  Cognitive maps are based on the principal component analysis of repertory grid data and provide a visual representation of the way in which the subjects see themselves in relation to other people and in relation to their construct.  The cognitive maps produced by 2 graduates shortly after entry in employment and 6 months later are analyzed and compared in order to identify trends of personal change.  The case studies show that the analysis of the cognitive maps provides some valuable insights into the way in which graduates change their construction of themselves and of their work environment during the period of transition.

T1  - Cognitive complexity in group performance and satisfaction
AN  - 304271855
AB  - In this study, a comparison was made between the various levels of group cognitive complexity and its relationship to task performance and task satisfaction. The goal of this research is to answer the general question, "Should decision-making groups consist of individuals who are similar in the way they differentiate and/or integrate various stimuli in order to increase performance and satisfaction?"    The preceding research problem was analyzed in a laboratory setting using a 2 x 2 factorial design blocked on the variable, cognitive complexity. The Repertory Grid was used to measure the cognitive complexity of 228 student subjects. These subjects were stratified into groups of three based on their cognitive complexity score on the Repertory Grid (Kelly, 1955). Each group was treated randomly with one of two levels of task complexity (complex or not complex). Moreover, the groups received an imposed group structure that incorporated centralized or decentralized decision-making.    Results indicated that groups consisting of cognitively complex members outperformed groups consisting of noncomplex members. No support was obtained for the two-way interaction between group cognitive complexity and either task complexity or group structure. Support was obtained for the interaction between task complexity and group structure on both task satisfaction measures. The highest satisfaction levels occurred with a complex task in a decentralized structure. In addition, the three-way interaction effect on the task satisfaction scale between group structure, task complexity, and group cognitive complexity was significant. The means, however, were not in the predicted direction. For cognitively simple groups, a complex task with a decentralized structure lead to the highest task satisfaction level; whereas, a less complex task with a decentralized group structure lead to the lowest task satisfaction score for noncomplex members. There were no significant differences for cognitively complex groups when analyzing the three-way interaction between group cognitive complexity, task complexity, and group structure.

T1  - Factors affecting information systems' success
AN  - 233642918
AB  - There is continuing difficulty in achieving success with information systems, particularly in the sense of meeting users' expectations and offers a fresh examination of those attributes of information systems by which users perceive success and failure, and through which they establish their expectations. Existing research literature is reviewed and it is suggested that, in addition to the process and product viewpoint, an important factor in achieving success is the service management perspective. Repertory grid techniques are applied to uncover a total of 43 constructs which relate to users' perceptions of success with information systems in business. These are reduced to 21 attributes which provide the basis of a new assessment and measurement framework, incorporating and augmenting the attributes found in previous work in this area.

T1  - Using repertory grids in management
AN  - 215399890
AB  - Since 1980, many changes have occurred in both the use and the application of the repertory grid technique. Unlike the initial monograph, this paper places greater emphasis on practicalities of completing a grid and the different types of analysis possible than on the applications of the grid. The grid offers a powerful way of quantifying people's attitudes, feelings, and perceptions. It focuses on how an individual focuses on how a single individual understands his or her own world in a particular context.

T1  - Death threat with young adults who have lost a parent to death
AN  - 231378813; 02616777
AB  - In a study, 20 people who experienced the death of a parent between the ages of 12-18 were compared with 22 people whose parents had not divorced, separated or died.  The results show that the death-loss group had significantly lower death threat means than the control group on the Interpersonal Repertory Grid.

T1  - A Repertory Grid Test of the Claim That Sense of Landscape Naturalness Is Specific to Culture
AN  - 1987643753
AB  - Repertory grid technique was used to test the claim that sense of landscape naturalness is socially constructed and culturally relative, and the reverse claim that sense of landscape naturalness is underlain by universals of human thought. Participants made judgments of sameness and difference concerning elements in a standard landscape of nine elements. Sample groups represented three cultures at extremes along a continuum of ideology concerning human relations with nature: Euro-Canadian at one end, Vuntut Gwich'in and north Baffin Inuit at the other. Results were consistent with the universalist but not the relativist hypothesis. Although principal factors for the three culture samples differ slightly, a common factor is nested within the variation, and it corresponds to the Euro-Canadian construct (natural x man-made). The study has implications for environmental education and environmental planning.

T1  - Validating a method for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures
AN  - 231420805; 01090536; 02501907
AB  - Cognitive mapping techniques refer to methods used to elicit the structure and content of people's mental models.  There is growing interest in applying these techniques to the study of managers' mental models of strategic management issues.  A new method is suggested for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures, that is based upon recent developments in the cognitive psychology of the categorization of concepts.  The method is evaluated with respect to its psychometric properties against the well established, but potentially cumbersome, repertory grid technique.  The method is demonstrated to have good validity by comparing it with the repertory grid technique.

T1  - Developing a lay model of managerial effectiveness: A social constructionist perspective
AN  - 194217103; 01083636
AB  - A study uses repertory grid interviews and a follow-up questionnaire study to develop a "lay" theory of managerial effectiveness in a large New Zealand public sector organization.  The lay theory is presented as a model with 17 scales and 2 factors descriptive of effective and ineffective managers in the organization.  The 2 factors indicate that effective and ineffective managers in the department are differentiated in terms of their conceptual, and interpersonal abilities.  The effectiveness model shows strong similarity to models of effective management which have emerged in research outside New Zealand.  This similarity is of particular interest given the context-specific nature of the study.

T1  - Feminist Identifications in a Troubled Society
AN  - 1988006207
AB  - This article reports selected findings from a programme of postgraduate research which examined women's identifications with feminism in Northern Ireland. This qualitative study used repertory grids and semi-structured interviews to explore the meanings of feminism with a total of 31 women. It shows how women `s perceptions of feminists have affected their decisions about whether or not to identify themselves as such. The data reported here are from case studies of 26 women. The repertory grids uncovered perceived commonalities and differences between women `s present and ideal selves and feminists, while the interviews revealed some of the conflicts women negotiate in their daily lives and the compromises they                       must
                   
 make in attempts at conflict resolution. A conflicting picture emerges in which many women support feminist ideals but do not identify as feminists because of a negative stereotype of feminists. While this stereotype has specific connotations in the context of Northern Ireland, it seems likely that certain aspects of it, and the ways in which it is used, may apply to other patriarchal and heterosexist societies.

AB  - An analysis identifies the dimensions of a higher customer contact food and beverage operative's job as perceived by managers, supervisors, and operatives and examines within-source and between-source differences in these perceptions.  The analysis uses 2 instruments, the repertory grid and the work profiling system.  It shows a number of distinct dimensions that are defined in terms of the worker behaviors necessary for the job tasks to be performed.  Managers/supervisors and operatives generally agree on a number of dimensions.  The analysis discusses variations occurring both with and between groups as well as implications for the choice of sources of job analysis data and the use of job analysis in a personnel selection and training context.

T1  - Women's view of pubs: A study of methods
AN  - 215863477; 01001079
AB  - Customers' experience of service encounters remains an area blessed with a rich folklore but little fundamental understanding.  A pilot study  explored women's experiences of public houses, and used idographic methods on a small sample of middle-class women: role repertory grids, critical-incident questionnaires, individual comparatively unstructured interviews, and group focus interviews.  Group interviews were most useful for coming quickly to a consensus picture, and the critical incident questionnaires allowed extreme examples of good and bad practice to be explored.  It is concluded that there is considerable variation in what women are looking to find in pubs, but that they agree on their dislike of male-dominated atmospheres in which they are harassed or made to feel unwelcome.

T1  - Subjective constructs and first appraisal in women with breast cancer
AN  - 304168936
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe patterns of personal cognitive constructs and first appraisal in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. A framework integrating the Folkman and Lazarus coping model (1984) and Kelly's Personal Construct Theory (1955) guided this study.    Sixty-two women from five different Italian regional hospitals participated in the study. Subjects were interviewed just prior to breast surgery. Breast surgery consisted of lumpectomy. Personal cognitive constructs were elicited during in-depth face-to-face interviews using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique (Kelly, 1955). First appraisal was measured using a visual analog scale with an investigator developed self report questionnaire. The basis for the questionnaire was Lazarus' three appraisal categories: Challenge, Threat, and Harm/Loss (Lazarus & Folkman, 1985). First appraisal was assessed both as perceived during the interview and as remembered by the subject immediately after the diagnosis. Demographic data were collected using an investigator designed demographic data form. Subjects were interviewed between 1 to 10 weeks following diagnosis. Fifty-two subjects were interviewed prior to the surgery, 10 were interviewed following surgery.    Many events used by the women to elicit their cognitive constructs were similar. The category "Challenge" was referred to by the majority of the women as the most intense at the time of the interview; based on the participant's memory, "Challenge" was also described by the majority as the most intense immediately following the diagnosis. No relationship was found between the participants' demography and category of appraisal. Some differences in the patterns of constructs characterized the subjects within the three appraisal categories.    Three conclusions were drawn: (a) the women generally used some similar typologies of events in construing the meanings of their disease; (b) the women preferred "Challenge" among the three categories of appraisal of cancer; and (c) there were some distinctive features in the patterns of personal cognitive constructs of women who appraised their breast cancer as Harm/Loss, Threat, or Challenge.    This study used a convenience sample of 62 Italian women, therefore the results are not generalizable beyond the participants. An insufficient number of subjects who had had surgery were accrued to the study to determine differences between those who had had surgery and those who had not. It is possible that women who participated had motives that were different than women who may have declined, and/or the physician had motives in approaching the participants. The majority of interviews were held in clinical settings exposed to environmental noise beyond the control of the interviewers. The translation from Italian to English may have caused modifications within the original meanings assigned by the participants. Lazarus's categories of appraisal may assume a different meaning when translated within Italian culture.    This study can be replicated on comparable samples of women across countries to evaluate the role of national cultures upon appraisal and constructs. Longitudinal research is needed to assess changes within constructs from diagnosis through to surgery, and finally, experimental research is needed to test the study's underlying assumption of a link between constructs and first appraisal of cancer and to evaluate the nursing interventions that could be used to help women with breast cancer.

T1  - The structure and content of organizational identity in hypercompetitive environments
AN  - 304164476
AB  - This research explored the structure and content of the organizational identity--members' beliefs about central, distinctive, and enduring organizational attributes--for a high performing organization operating in a rapidly and discontinuously changing hypercompetitive environment. The study compared the dimensions of organizational attributes provided by members for similarities and differences across subunits and the organization as a whole. Analyses examined the extent to which organizational identity attributes are shared, and assessed the potential existence of distinct, coherent subidentities across geographic locations, business units, and organizational levels. The study also examined a new theory of organizational identity structure and content. This theory posits that intangible aspects of organizational identity will be more central than substantive elements in high performing organizations. As a first step in validating this theory, the study examined whether organizational identity dimensions for a hypercompetitive organization can validly be classified into intangible and substantive categories.    A sample of Intel Corporation employees completed an instrument based on a method that originated in cognitive psychology, the repertory grid technique. This method allowed organization members to identify dimensions of organizational attributes of Intel without the imposition of the researcher's frame of reference. This technique provided insights into the cognitive frameworks members hold regarding their high performance organization in a hypercompetitive environment.    The study found that organization members do share organizational identity attributes, although the number of widely shared attributes is small. Additionally, when members rated various organizational identity components along self-supplied dimensions, they made significant distinctions between current and ideal organizational identity. Evidence also was discovered supporting the existence of distinct subidentities by location, business unit, and organizational level. Preliminary support was obtained for the classification of identity attributes as either intangible or substantive.    The major theoretical contributions of this research are the verification of shared organizational identity attributes, the documentation of distinct organizational subidentities, and a theory of two types of organizational identity attributes for hypercompetitive organizations was proposed and tested. This study's primary methodological contribution is the application of a promising methodology for the study of organizational identity.

T1  - Change in self construction during the transition from university to employment: A personal construct psychology approach
AN  - 199362776; 00952199
AB  - A personal construct psychology framework and repertory grids were used in a longitudinal study designed to analyze the qualitative and evaluative nature of change in graduates' self-construction during the 6 months following organizational entry.  In line with the hypotheses guiding the research, the results suggest that graduates undertook some important qualitative change in self-construction but that these trends of change reflected individual developmental paths rather than a common socialization effect; change took place through both the development of new core role constructs, and change in self-ratings on stable constructs (slot change).  The study provides some modest support for the hypothesis concerning the positive relationship between self-esteem and role meaningfulness.  However, the initial level of self-esteem does not appear to moderate the effect of low role meaningfulness on subsequent  level of self-esteem, a finding that fails to support the hypothesis.

T1  - Understanding customers' views: An example of the use of repertory grid technique: MRN
AN  - 223524091; 00991231
AB  - Repertory grid testing was used as part of a marketing research project.  The goal of the investigation was to use interviews to identify how customers perceive product support for high-technology products (using the medical equipment market as a test case).  Product support is the name given in industry to the various forms of assistance that companies provide to customers to help them obtain maximum value from high-technology products.  Several key points emerged from the interviews: 1.  Interviews need careful design and piloting, to ensure that they achieve the research goals and fit with the boundary conditions of the sample and market under investigation.  2.  The repertory grid method can be used to help subjects articulate their views on a complex topic, in a situation where direct questioning is liable to cause interviewer bias.  3.  The repertory grid method  produces clear descriptions on constructs - so that they are unequivocal.

T1  - Clumping data in 2-way tables: A user-orientated perspective
AN  - 231359962; 00821816
AB  - Following a critique of existing algorithms, an algorithm is presented which will reorganize a 2-way data table to bring like rows together, and like columns together.  Extensions of the method are described, and justified, to accommodate distances measured in modular arithmetic, and with bipolar columns/rows, as in repertory grid analysis.  One value of the algorithms is that the user can see relationships in the tables without the data in the cells themselves ever having been transformed.  Thus, users will continue to feel they own their data.

T1  - You're stopping me from giving quality service
AN  - 228367288; 00861423
AB  - Quality initiatives need to be translated into actions by employees.  The importance of eliciting the knowledge and beliefs that employees use to guide their decisions at work is highlighted, and it is argued that everyday discourse (for example, conversation and group discussion) is an inadequate basis from which to unearth this information.  A variety of psychological techniques that can be used to help people "get at" their own views are outlined.  A study is reported that used situational interviewing and the repertory grid technique to elicit the models that food servers in the hospitality industry have of internal systems and procedures.  The "maps" that food servers have of service situations and colleagues reveal areas for quality improvement.

T1  - Gender, diversity and working styles
AN  - 213150619; 00848971
AB  - Evidence from a research study into the impact of gender on management styles is presented using repertory grid as a methodology.  Generalized differences were identified in the approaches of women and men to definition of the job, overall style, decision making, and interpersonal relationships.  Men had greater visibility to other men, while a broader insight was offered by women interviewees into the women managers' approaches.  In the context of patriarchal power relations, in which masculinity is defined as opposite and superior to femininity, feminine working styles are perceived as less effective in organizations, while masculine attributes tend to be regarded as normatively the way to manage.  Such values can imbue recruitment, selection, and development practices with gender bias.  Recent management and leadership theory has advocated the value of a people-centered approach, which traditionally and stereotypically has been associated with women.  There is a need to be alert to a redefinition of patriarchal relations as men seek to maintain status.

The book mentions two other criteria for assessing people but these are harder to translate: "using a repertory grid methodology to lead managers to differentiate between successful and less successful individuals and therefore behaviours; and collecting a wide range of information by the use of an appropriately designed job analysis questionnaire".

T1  - Decision making in health service managers
AN  - 212085009; 00807396
AB  - Although the literature on managerial decision making typically espouses rationality, this rarely occurs.  Managers form a personal and simplified model of the real situation, incorporating personal and environmental factors, to facilitate their decision making.  A study used a repertory grid to explore the decision making model of 16 National Health Service managers and investigate what factors were important to them when considering strategic decisions.  Results indicated the complex and idiosyncratic nature of managerial decision making, vindicating the view that to understand decision making in any detail requires knowledge of the individual's model.  Rationality did not emerge as the driving force underlying the managers' decision making behavior.  For many managers, emotional items seemed to exert a significant influence on their decision making.  A link between patterns of construing and stress was hypothesized.  Managers whose construing was simpler, contained contradictions, or was more emotional in content reported experiencing more stress.

AB  - Abstract. The selection and evaluation of road schemes through the Leitch framework is based on a combination of cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment. Both techniques involve the definition and valuation of a number of costs and benefits. These costs and benefits are defined and valued in isolation to each other so that we Imow virtually nothing about the relative valuation that people assign to different types of costs and benefits which might affect them directly or indirectly. This paper outlines the development of a method which allows people to conceptualise the costs and benefits of a road scheme in their own terms and then to rank schemes in relation to those costs and benefits. This method is based upon an interview process involving the use of repertory grid technique. The information from the repertory grid technique is used as a sound basis for determining trade-offs between attributes and for attempting to obtain monetary valuations of different project attributes. A number of exploratory interviews are reported which outline some of the difficulties with a number of the survey features including the choice of case-study, interviewer and information biases and sample and non-response biases. Various ways of dealing with these difficulties are discussed.

T1  - The Role of Fragrances in Product Development: Turning Images into Fragrances
AN  - 196319738; 00628116
AB  - The sensory properties of products are particularly important in the area of fine fragrances.  In an investigation, 10 assessors discussed some 19 fragrances, 19 essential oils, and 8 relevant chemical stimuli over a number of sessions.  Using group discussion, repertory grid, direct mapping, and simple profiling approaches, the assessors derived a list of 14 defined descriptors.  Fragrance descriptions and characteristics were grouped and reduced to a list which was used to obtain consumer reactions to actual fragrances assessed blind.  Under controlled evaluation conditions, 23 consumers tested 16 fragrances.  The sensory analysis and the subsequent linking of this to the image data showed that fragrant formulations can be identified in a consistent way using trained assessors and that this descriptive information can give good guidance to the product developer about what type of fragrance will suit a particular market position or the tastes of a particular consumer segment.

T1  - Cognitive Mapping and Repertory Grids for Qualitative Survey Research: Some Comparative Observations
AN  - 194219945; 00626878
AB  - A study of business strategy was carried out in 86 organizations in the crop protection industry.  A multi-operational approach was used to enable validation of data by triangulation.  This provided an opportunity to conduct a comparative evaluation of interactional investigative methods in a relatively controlled manner.  Some conclusions of the analysis are: 1.  Cognitive mapping satisfies many more process criteria than repertory grids.  2.  The data that cognitive maps produce are less comparable than the data from repertory grids.  3.  Splitting maps produced under the constraints introduced for the purposes of the project (actual versus ideal states) allows the respondent to focus on specific aspects of the ideal state one at a time and in contrast to the actual.  4.  Cognitive maps-as-programs possibly do not represent the cognitive structure of the client's own problem conception.  5.  Skeleton entries to cognitive maps (COPE) can be preferable to full-string entry for certain purposes, such as the analysis of large survey data.

T1  - Validating an Expert Support System for Tender Enquiry Evaluation: A Case Study
AN  - 231388133; 00610102
AB  - The Tender Enquiry Evaluation System (TEES) was developed as a support tool for a large electromechanical engineering company.  The system was developed to assist in tender enquiry evaluation and the bid versus no bid decision.  It was developed using repertory grid techniques based on the expertise of 2 senior managers.  The importance of the system's validation is stressed, and an appropriate formal validation framework is developed.  The results from the validation study suggest that the system provides an appropriate model of the organization's consensual business perspective regarding the bid versus no bid decision.  Furthermore, the study drew attention to some dissenting views among the organization's senior management that the managers believed to be helpful in clarifying their understanding of the issues affecting the bid versus no bid decision.

T1  - Validation of the Repertory Grid for Use in Modeling Knowledge
AN  - 231382313; 00603508
AB  - The extrapolation of theories of cognitive modeling from the psychological contexts to the domain of information systems design has raised empirical questions regarding the validity and reliability of these techniques in the new applications environment.  Kelly's (1955) theory of personal construct psychology (PCP) is one such theory that, together with the repertory grid technique of cognitive modeling, is being explored for use in systems development.  Since the repertory grid constitutes a mechanism for both the elicitation and the representation of cognitive models, it has been suggested for incorporation into intelligent front-end interfaces for information storage and retrieval systems (ISRS).  Previous applications of the grid have emphasized the personal and ideographic characteristics of personal construct systems.  The repertory grid is tested for representing commonality of construing among members of a homogeneous group of subjects.  Some differences are noted between constructs generated by subjects and those provided for them by an expert.  Implications of this effect for the application of PCP to ISRS design are discussed.

T1  - Developing an Expert Support System for Tender Enquiry Evaluation: A Case Study
AN  - 204125984; 00614855
AB  - Assessing customers' tender inquiries to decide whether to bid or not is important for companies where the cost of tendering is high.  In the case considered, the expertise of 2 managers involved in assessing inquiries was developed into an expert support system.  Knowledge was elicited from these managers by asking them to consider previous tenders and specify the factors used in discriminating between them.  Their responses were rerpresented in repertory grids.  Analyses of these grids led to maps that show the hierarchical nature of the relationships between the key factors used by the managers.  The resulting expert support system improved the consistency of the inquiry review group, revealed unexpected aspects of the managers' reasoning and was generally welcomed by the company.

AN  - 215400897; 00605970
AB  - A model of effective set advising is researched from a literature review and repertory grid interviews with set advisers and is then tested against experience.  The 4 key dimensions that need to be managed to be able to deal effectively with a set are: 1.  the content dimension, which requires interpersonal skills and project diagnosis, planning, and management, 2.  the process dimension, by which the set adviser communicates and transfers action learning, the nature of team and group dynamics, and the basic group processes, 3.  the human feelings dimension, including how feelings are dealt with, put into a frame of reference, revealed, and acted upon, and 4.  the administration dimension, which involves ensuring that the logistics are in place.  Total contingency theories are challenged.  Behavioral and conceptual tools are developed by which advisers can be coached and developed over the dynamic life cycle of the set.

T1  - On Elephants and Blind Researchers: Methods for Accessing Culture in Organisations
AN  - 1698138491
AB  - This research compares two pre-existing methodologies for accessing culture, repertory grids and focused group discussions, with a modified version of the Twenty Statements Test (Kuhn and McPartland, 1954), a method originally developed to measure self concept. The comparison is made on the basis of three criteria: the levels and elements of culture accessed by the different methods; the amount and usefulness of the information gathered; and finally, the ease of use of the methods. The comparison of the methods is based on information gathered from 158 participants in a major UK company and the results clearly suggest that the modified Twenty Statements Test has most potential as a method for accessing culture in organisation. The results also suggest that the conceptualisation of aspects of culture needs to be clearer and more focused if progress in understanding about the content and consequences of culture is to be made.

T1  - Management Consultancy: Dimensions of Client-Consultancy Relationships
AN  - 1698137239
AB  - Although a great deal of management consultancy has been carried out in a wide variety of settings, very little research has been conducted examining underlying dimensions of the client-consultant relationship. The present study examines consultant and client perceptions of the consulting relationship. A procedure based on repertory grid technique was employed to elicit dimensions of client consultant relationships from 22 management consultants and 16 of their clients within a major UK company. A questionnaire was then developed in order to determine the importance and frequency of these dimensions to participants, and also to highlight the differences between the views of clients and consultants. Dimensions were found to fall within four broad categories: those relating to the client; those relating to the consultant; dimensions associated with contract details; and dimensions focused on relationship building. While both clients and consulting relationships, they differed in emphasis they placed on the different categories. More specifically, consultants viewed dimensions relating to relationship building as most important, while clients placed greater emphasis on dimensions associated with contract details. Recommendations, based on these findings are made for monitoring and enhancing client-consultant relationships.

T1  - Construing of self and others at work in the early years of corporate careers: Summary
AN  - 228760975
AB  - Research has examined personal change and stability in early adulthood but generally with standardized scales and without inviting explicit comparison of self with other people. The present work uses the repertory grid method to examine how graduates construe themselves and others during early career. Ninety-four graduate entrants to a multinational corporation with zero to four years' tenure completed repertory grids on two occasions one year apart. Results shed much light on the graduates' concepts of self relative to others in their work setting, and how these change over time. The graduates generally had fairly positive self concepts, though these did not become more positive with tenure. Most saw themselves much as they thought others saw them. Change in concepts of self varied greatly between graduates, as did the constructs on which those concepts were described. The results cast further doubt on whether organizational socialization affects people in uniform ways.

T1  - Etude préliminaire de l'abus sexuel précoce
AN  - 1969736706
AB  - The long term effects of sexual abuse are often measured by measuring behaviours such as social adjustment, job stability and marriage. This study was conducted to add to these internal measures. Using a semi-prospective instrument adapted from G. Kelly's repertory grid, the adolescents' perceptions of themselves and significant others are measured. Three hundred and twelve female adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19 (average age = 16) participated in the study; 79 presented with non sexual behaviour disorders (delinquency, stealing, etc.), 56 presented with serious sexual behaviour disorders (prostitution, persistant sexual promiscuity) and 177 presented with no problems requiring psychosocial intervention. Various analyses (descriptive, multiple variance, regression analysis) showed that sexual abuse significantly affects many of the adolescents' perceptions. Sexually abused adolescents perceived their two real parents as less competent and their ideal mother and father as less protective than adolescents who had not been abused. In contrast, their perception of self and the ideal self was not affected by the sexual abuse, a finding which will spark discussion.

T1  - A Question of Competency
AN  - 202753174; 00504121
AB  - Managers are now being encouraged to list the competencies that any employee in the organization needs to operate successfully.  The competencies are then used in selection, promotion, appraisal, counseling, and vocational guidance.  Lists of competencies come from autocratic chief executives and directors who go through focused interviews.  The lists also are acquired by group discussions, repertory grids, analysis, or adapting someone else's list.  Organizations devise ways of measuring the competencies so that applicants and employees can be compared and contrasted.  While there is a wealth of theories and studies attempting to specify the basic traits and abilities that are common to employees in a particular business, the question of what precisely competencies are remains unanswered.  A list of competencies is just that - a list, but human abilities are clearly related.  After deciding on its competency profile, an organization should investigate the structure of the competencies.

T1  - Repertory Grid Technique in Employee Selection
AN  - 214808582; 00509200
AB  - The repertory grid technique (RGT) is a psychological technique capable of elucidating the person-job match and the job-person match in employee selection.  The grid basically is a sorting exercise designed to elicit the dimensions, criteria, or constructs underlying an individual's rationale for all sorting decisions made.  Although essentially different, the task reactions repertory grid and the interview perceptions repertory grid hint at 2 inherent advantages - flexibility of design and face validity to participants.  Despite potential disadvantages with grids, the RGT and the underlying theoretical stance of personal construct psychology have much potential as an alternative and complementary strategy in employee selection.  When considering uses of the grid where the recruiter is acting as a participant, 3 interrelated applications arise: 1.  interviewer training, 2.  interviewer selection, and 3.  the identification of candidate assessment criteria.  A 2nd set of grid applications involves the applicant as the participant and follows from the contention that the RGT could be used to examine the job-person match.

Results did not support Frascella's 1972 assumption that constructs relating to fluency differ in the communication subsystems of stutterers and nonstutterers.  Stereotypical notions about stuttering were characteristic of stutterers and nonstutterers.

T1  - Intuition in Venture Capital Decisions: An Exploratory Study Using a New Technique
AN  - 195844086; 00497375; 00270535
AB  - An exploratory study used the repertory grid technique, drawn from personal construct psychology, to develop an understanding of intuition.  In-depth interviews with 5 venture capitalists were conducted to obtain information about the particular constructs each uses in thinking about investment proposals.  The goal was to obtain systematic data on the content and structure of intuitions prior to the development of a questionnaire to be issued to a larger sample.  The results indicated that investment constructs can be grouped into 3 areas: management, unique opportunity, and appropriate return.  A cluster analysis showed that each venture capitalist had his own way of structuring the intuitions involved in the investment decision.  The results suggested that individuals seeking venture capital may need to adjust their approach to different venture capitalists in view of the diversity involved.

T1  - Knowledge Bases: Integration, Verification, and Partitioning
AN  - 204166494; 00466628
AB  - A literature review is presented of 3 aspects of knowledge base design: 1.  knowledge integration, 2.  knowledge verification, and 3.  knowledge-base partitioning.  The key approaches to combining multiple expertise include: 1.  metaknowledge, 2.  set theoretic, 3.  consensus theory, 4.  repertory grid analysis, 5.  cluster analysis, and 6.  decision theory.  Combining expertise improves poor individual performance but degrades good individual performance.  This means that it is preferable to construct expert systems using consensus when the domain knowledge does not exists in a state of high conflict.  Verification techniques include: 1.  knowledge acquisition-based verification, 2.  graph-based verification, 3.  confidence-value verification, and 4.  iterative verification.  Most verification techniques can be classified as either consistency checkers or completeness checkers.  Information-theoretic approaches and cluster analysis approaches are among the knowlege-base partitioning methods.

T1  - The Brightest and the Best: Factors Influencing the Retention or Withdrawal of Completing Teachers
AN  - 1979058489
AB  - Allegations that the most able simply intend to leave teaching were challenged by qualitative and quantitative data collected from 147 prospective teachers completing their credentialling diploma. A conceptual framework combining personal construct and social learning theories modelled the influences of personal, academic and social factors on intended persistence. A single line version of the repertory grid elicited reasons for intended persistence or withdrawal which were coded into 11 categories supported by the literature. A multiple classification analysis showed that those who were confident of promotion and who were committed to and satisfied by teaching intended persisting. While the findings were less clear for psychological constructs and for academic and social integration, some of the best prospective teachers intended staying for at least five years. The course itself was well received.

T1  - Important Dimensions of Strategic Issues: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
AN  - 194221024; 00465955
AB  - Decision makers must use dimensions to sort the wheat from the chaff in the field of potential strategic issues.  The dimensions implied by 3 literatures and dimensions generated by an empirical study are compared.  A search of the 3 literatures identified 26 dimensions that differentiate strategic issues.  Repertory grid techniques were used to identify the range of attributes used to define the "meaning space" for strategic issues in a sample of strategic decision makers at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  Dimensions in the literature overlap those in the empirical study; 13 dimensions accounted for 51% of the frequency with which all attributes were mentioned over all respondents.  However, these 13 dimensions exclude the one cited most often in the literature - immediacy.  Also, marked differences in the relative importance of classes of dimensions emerged in the sample relative to the literature.  Issue content was about 3 times as prevalent in the sample, action was about the same in both, analytic characteristics were almost twice as prevalent in the literature, and source did not emerge in the sample at all.

T1  - Construing the Business Portfolio: A Cognitive Model of Diversification
AN  - 194219336; 00465957
AB  - Researchers investigating the relationship between diversification and performance have been generally inattentive to the dominant general management logics that corporate-level managers use to understand and manage strategy diversity.  In response to this, the use of the repertory grid is proposed.  The grid is a methodology adapted from the work of Kelly (1955) and other personal construct theorists.  As an approach to operationalizing the mental maps that direct the management of strategic diversity, the business repertory grid appears to have several important advantages.  It is particularly useful in assessing the ways in which top managers construe the corporate portfolio and manage strategic diversity.  Grid technique is flexible, efficient, and systematic.  It is also highly reproducible, thus allowing researchers to validate or challenge the results of previous studies.  A main goal of the application of the repertory grid to the study of strategic diversity is to measure the way in which top managers perceive relationships among businesses in their firms.

T1  - Exploring the Meaning of Work and Nonwork
AN  - 224870755; 00450278
AB  - A study explored the relationship between work and nonwork activities for a group of employed professional and skilled tradespeople in New Zealand.  A preliminary sample of 40 subjects were used to to develop a 12-element repertory grid that was included in the questionnaires mailed to accountants, dentists, lawyers, primary school teachers, and plumbers.  Eighty-one usable responses were obtained.  The results confirmed previous research with the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic features of paid employment and the importance of a 3rd factor related to stress, time constraints, and the lack of free choice.  The results reaffirmed that job satisfaction is associated with the chance to use abilities and skills and with recognition for work well done.  More surprising was the clear distinction that these subjects made between the work and nonwork aspects of their lives and the perceived differences between their paid employment activities and nonwork activities, with little evidence of generalization between them.

T1  - Do Psychotherapists Use Different Construct Subsystems for Construing Clients and Acquaintances? A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 848882787
AB  - Forty-seven psychotherapists were studied to determine if they used different construct subsystems for construing clients and personal acquaintances. The sample included therapists who varied in terms of sex, age, years of experience, and clinical discipline. Subjects chose six personal acquaintances and six nonpsychotic individual therapy clients who were then used as elements in a Repertory Grid. Constructs were elicited by comparing pairs of elements; all elements were rated on the constructs. It was found that constructs elicited about one domain (clients or acquaintances) were less applicable to elements from the other domain. Therapists more often used constructs related to emotional stability when construing clients than acquaintances, whereas differences in construct content were not evident on several other dimensions. The domain of client construal exhibited greater cognitive differentiation and hierarchical organization than did that of acquaintance construal. The results suggest that therapists use different conceptual subsystems for client and acquaintance construal. Implications for the training of therapists are discussed.

AN  - 237018506; 00445702
AB  - Techniques are required to enable the user and analyst to work together in formulating and developing a model for the analysis of problems characterized by unclear statement of requirements.  Some techniques are described, and the rationale for their application to the process of information requirements analysis in the context of an experimental strategy is discussed.  In particular, the techniques described are delphi, game playing, operational experimentations, opinion questionnaires and surveys, pilot studies, prototyping, repertory grids, and system simulation.  Guidelines to support strategy formulation include considering: 1.  the purpose of the exercise, 2.  the underlying methodological approach, 3.  the particular strategy adopted, and 4.  the technique or mixture of techniques.  Analysis indicates there is a need to develop an experimental plan, a need to formulate strategy, and a need to understand the characteristics of the techniques.

T1  - Building Societies as Retail Banks: The Importance of Customer Service and Corporate Image
AN  - 231439820; 00449302; 00097163
AB  - UK building societies have successfully attracted funds in a deregulated environment; however, they have begun to lose some of their dominance in the mortgage market.  In a more competitive environment, building societies are diversifying and using more effective marketing techniques.  They have tended to distinguish themselves from competitors by emphasizing qualitative factors, such as friendliness and quality of service.  A survey on the topic of financial institutions was made of 30 individuals using Kelly's (1955) Repertory Grid technique.  It was found that building societies were perceived as distinct from banks in terms of traditional functions.  Building societies were generally considered more friendly, and banks were perceived as more efficient and businesslike.  Building societies have a competitive edge in terms of their favorable image, which they should emphasize in their attempts to develop stronger corporate identities.

T1  - A Repertory Grid Analysis of Austria's Image as a Summer Vacation Destination
AN  - 217447123; 00442413
AB  - The appropriateness of Kelly's (1955) repertory grid technique to destination image research is demonstrated.  Images held by UK vacationers of Austria as a summer destination were investigated.  A sample of 25 individuals matching middle-class and opinion-leadership characteristics were asked questions concerning recent vacations, future vacations, and countries to elicit names of countries.  Minimum context form (triadic method) was used to elicit constructs.  Respondents then located each country on a 5-point rating scale to match their image of the destination.  The respondents generated 296 constructs from 17 elements, and 3,062 ratings of 17 nations were obtained.  Content analysis reduced the constructs into 11 clusters.  In general, Austria was seen as an attractive destination for a summer vacation; 8 of the 25 participants rated it at the highest point.  The image data generated by the grid have the potential for more validity than those produced by structured questionnaires.

T1  - Construct System Organization and Schizophrenia: The Role of Construct Integration
AN  - 848853860
AB  - Personal construct psychology researchers frequently have linked a low degree of construct relatedness to schizophrenia. However, researchers also have found a low degree of construct relatedness to be predictive of accuracy in person perception tasks. Attempting to clarify this, Landfield (1977,1980) proposed that the schizophrenic's construing is characterized by both a low degree of construct integration and a low degree of construct relatedness. The role of both these variables was explored by administering repertory grids to 20 schizophrenic and 20 nonschizophrenic adult psychiatric inpatients. The linkage of schizophrenia to both a low degree of construct relatedness and a low degree of construct integration was supported. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Repertory Grid Methodology and the Analysis of Group Perceptions in Retailing
AN  - 198035495; 00433968
AB  - The use and potential of Repertory Grid Methodology and Personal Construct Theory (Kelly, 1955) in attitude measurement in retailing is investigated.  Researchers have been attracted to the Kelly theory because of its objectivity and the chance of obtaining a group viewpoint.  Case studies using the methodology include: 1.  students' shopping patterns (Hudson, 1974), 2.  shopping centers (Timmermans, Van Der Heijden, and Westerveld, 1982), 3.  comparison shopping -- shoes (Coshall, 1984, 1985), 4.  food shopping -- all store types (Opacic and Potter, 1985, 1986), and 5.  food superstores (Hallsworth, 1987).  The applicability of Kelly's technique was expanded by breaking away from a dependence on the assessment of the opinions of less than 100 persons.  The overriding advantage of the technique is its objectivity; it does not permit researchers to impose ideas on the subjects.  Constructs derived from retail applications of Kelly-type analysis are usually meaningful and easily understood by third parties, but the method can be very time-consuming.  This is reflected often in its sample sizes.

T1  - Beyond Focus Groups: A Thrift's Guide to Market Research
AN  - 204607160; 00369249; 00130408
AB  - Market research has become increasingly important for thrifts in today's competitive environment.  Market research helps assess the potential market for a proposed technology or define the factors that influence consumer behavior.  There are several research methods available to augment the traditional focus groups and telephone surveys.  For example, individual, in-depth interviews can overcome the problems of focus group research aimed at busy, affluent customers.  A more cost-effective alternative are Teledepth interviews, conducted by telephone, which can cover a wider and more diverse geographic area.  If the "group effect" is needed, a Telegroup can be used.  These are focus groups conducted by teleconferencing.  The Knowledge/Attitudes/Practices study combines quantitative and qualitative research to examine an individual's assumptions and behavior.  The Kelly Repertory Grid helps determine exactly which dimensions consumers use to evaluate and make purchasing decisions.  Finally, segmentation analysis can help thrifts target the subcategories in an overall financial market.

T1  - Cognitive Performance Appraisal -- Mapping Managers' Category Structures Using the Grid Technique
AN  - 214807150; 00377095
AB  - The repertory grid technique, a systematic method for eliciting the constructs that make up a person's cognitive structure, permits the mapping of a manager's frame of reference toward employee performance.  After selecting the elements to be used in obtaining managers' reference frames toward employee performance, the logical elements, i.e., the employees under the manager's supervision, are divided randomly into triads.  The manager is asked to show ways in which each combination of 2 employees varies from a 3rd.  This typically generates a construct mix related to personal traits of the employee and job performance.  The manager differentiates between triads until all personal constructs are exhausted and, by using a 5- or 7-point scale, rates the extent to which each employee is characterized by each construct.  Rating all elements in terms of all constructs produces a standard matrix or grid.  Several indexes can be constructed on the basis of the completed grid: 1.  frame differentiation, 2.  frame complexity, 3.  frame integration, 4.  construct centrality, and 5.  construct ranking.

T1  - Repertory Grid Combined with Learning Styles: A Pilot Study
AN  - 214112858; 00365817
AB  - The preferences of a learner are important to consider when attempting to make a learning event effective.  Honey and Mumford (1986) defined 4 basic learning styles: 1.  activists, 2.  reflectors, 3.  theorists, and 4.  pragmatists.  A research project, designed to investigate the learning style of individuals and to use the results to help in personal coaching and development sessions, used the Repertory Grid technique in combination with Honey and Mumford's Learning Style Questionnaire (LSQ).  The Repertory Grid is a method of understanding and structuring how people perceive things and make distinctions between various aspects of their environment.  During the study, each individual was given the Repertory Grid to complete, then asked to complete the LSQ.  The difference between each set of ratings was noted, as well as the ratings depicting "learned the most" and "learned the least." All the study's participants felt the results were indicative of their personal learning styles.

T1  - A Behavioural Analysis of Demand Elasticities
AN  - 220674107; 00344017
AB  - Based on ideas from personal construct psychology, it is proposed that people feel attached or strongly desire to become attached to specific consumption pathways because they assess that doing otherwise would entail implications of a predominately negative kind with respect to their abilities to understand the complex and uncertain world around them.  Information-processing problems may cause consumers to be unable to compute the overall implications of alternative strategies when market conditions alter.  Therefore, they may use simplifying decision methods that may conflict with the principle of substitution.  The research program of personal construct psychology includes a set of research techniques for revealing ways in which individuals view the world, and 3 of these techniques are: 1.  repertory grid, 2.  construct laddering, and 3.  Hinkle's (1965) implication grid.  These 3 tools show the implications to the consumer of choosing one of the action schemes over the others.

AN  - 196846819; 00306592
AB  - PA Consultants (London) has developed the criterion-referenced interview, which can provide structure to employment interviews because it is based on detailed analysis of the job.  Focal points of the analysis include: 1.  tasks associated with the job, 2.  personal characteristics, and 3.  the organization's culture.  Two approaches can assist supervisors in moving from general impressions to specific professional and personal qualities in their interviewing questions -- Kelley's Repertory Grid and Flanagan's Critical Incident.  A panel of supervisors and managers should use a list of observable behaviors to rank those behaviors according to: 1.  how important each is to reaching and maintaining a superior level of performance, and 2.  how frequently each one is required in a typical time period.  Having the job criteria clearly in mind is the key to using the criterion-referenced interview.

T1  - A Measure of the Integrative Complexity of Personal Constructs
AN  - 848853288
AB  - A repertory grid measure of the integrative complexity of personal constructs is described. The grid is proposed as a measure of a subject's use of comprehensive abstract constructs to integrate and direct the sampling of characteristics used in forming impressions of people. The grid method is based on principles described by Piaget as characterizing the stage of formal operations. At the stage of formal operations, the child uses abstract constructions of what is possible to direct the exploration of what is available to experience. The use of such abstract organizing constructs is referred to here as "integrative complexity." Grid scores of integrative complexity were found to match simulations of the progressive integration versus fragmentation of constructions. The grid scores were also found to correlate with Crockett's measure of level of organization in impression formation. The results support the credibility of the coordinate grid measure of integrative complexity

T1  - Using Repertory Grids for Problem Construction
AN  - 231252923; 00258966
AB  - Repertory grid theory (Kelly, 1955) was originally developed as a practical means of mapping an individual's perceptions of reality.  Recently, repertory grids have gained the attention of operations researchers as a tool for analyzing large, ill-defined decision problems.  Grid theory is discussed, and grid construction in application to a simple decision problem involving a single individual, along with the use of rating scales to measure preferences for decision alternatives, is demonstrated.  Application of grid theory and techniques is then extended to operations research problems, and alternative methods of problem construction, including cognitive mapping, are examined.  It is concluded that grids offer a coherent approach to problem construction in operations research, but are not necessarily preferable to other methods of problem analysis.

AB  - The paper presents an ideographic research approach that is being developed to describe the career biographies of individual teachers. These 'portrayals' were seen as a means for exploring the notion of professional development and the personal and contextual conditions that bear upon it. Interviews, together with a variation on the repertory grid technique, were used with two experienced teachers as the means for constructing their phenomenological life-worlds. Implications for in-service education policies and strategies are drawn from the case studies, and a case is presented for the importance of developing models of teacher development complementary to models of curriculum innovation.

AN  - 215394562; 00250763
AB  - The problem-centered approach to management team development is preferable to packaged team building approaches that often make erroneous assumptions about problems to be solved.  The problem-centered method uses actual work problems and begins with an accurate diagnosis of problems and the development of strategies to resolve them.  Repertory grids and identity matrices are used to analyze similarities, differences, and group perceptions of relationships among team members.  Once problems are identified, problem-centered activity begins.  It includes: 1.  expression of the problems, 2.  sharing of perceptions of the problems, 3.  the consensus of the nature of the problems, 4.  the development of solutions, 5.  the allocation of responsibility for solutions, and 6.  agreement on follow-up stages.  The use of actual work problems facilitates the transference of learning to the workplace.  Case studies are given that indicate the success of this approach.

AB  - The sex-role stereotypes held by heterosexual and homosexual men were examined by comparing their Repertory Grid scores. It was found that homosexual men held less rigid sex-role stereotypes than heterosexuals. Degree of opposite-sex identification was marginally greater in homosexuals, but neither group showed strong masculine or feminine stereotypic identification. Homosexual men perceived themselves as psychologically more distant from their fathers than did their heterosexual counterparts; this was probably an effect of homosexuality rather than a cause.

T1  - An Algorithm for the Cluster Analysis of Repertory Grids in Human Resource Development
AN  - 214807914; 00196950
AB  - The Repertory Grid can be used as a descriptive technique for describing the construct systems of varied respondents across a range of applications.  An analysis of the basic grid and its variations in the area of personnel management and training demonstrated its strengths and weaknesses.  The primary advantage of grids is that they are a powerful way to describe individual cases, giving a detailed account of data from an individual employee.  The main disadvantage of grids is that they generate large amounts of idiosyncratic data that are less useful for statistical analysis.  One method of cluster analysis used in occupational settings is Focus.  In its original form as a computer program, Focus results in easily interpretable information from single grids; in its aggregated version, Sociogrid, Focus lends itself to the interpretation of sets of grids.  The cluster analysis is presented as an algorithm for computation by hand in a nonstatistical, straightforward format with some illustrative case material to suggest its applicability in personnel practice.

AB  - A common problem of all cognitive-behavioural models of destination choice is that of the identification of factors influencing the behaviour of interest. This paper considers the applicability of Kelly's repertory grid methodology to identify the factors influencing consumer choice of shopping centres. Firstly, some methodological issues in the assessment of the relative importance people attach to certain variables in deciding where to shop are discussed. Secondly, the main findings of an application of the repertory grid methodology are presented. The paper concludes by discussing some implications of the measurement of the determinants of choice behaviour and the construction of mathematical models of destination choice.

T1  - Short research note: Stress among air traffic controllers: occupational sources of coronary heart disease risk SUMMARY
AN  - 227195111
AB  - This study attempts to assess the sources of occupational stress on air traffic controllers. It is based on data collected from a majority of air traffic controllers at a large U.K. airport. There are two unique methodological features described in this article. First, the use of the repertory grid technique as a method of generating work stressor variables, and second, the use of the multiple logistic equation as a coronary heart disease risk index.

T1  - Allocation of Repertory Grid Constructs to Superordinate Categories: Interjudge Reliability
AN  - 1970427613
AB  - After using a form of the Repertory Grid technique to elicit from teachers constructs of the characteristics of children with behaviour problems, the authors and four other judges allocated the constructs to superordinate categories.Some research reports have indicated that the criterion for interjudge reliability has been product moment correlations of the number of constructs allocated to categories. It is possible that such a method may lead to misinterpretation.Interjudge reliabilities, expressed by product moment correlations, were high when number of constructs was considered. However, an investigation carried out to ascertain percentages of same constructs allocated to the categories revealed that relatively low percentages of constructs were so allocated.

T1  - Toward a Cognitive Methodology of Organizational Assessment
AN  - 236285213; 00135729
AB  - An objective method for describing an organization in terms of its members' subjective, cognitive structures is presented.  The method is an adaptation of the Kelly Repertory Grid.  It produces a description of an organization's cognitive infrastructure.  Practitioners will find the method useful for most kinds of organizational research.  However, it is particularly suitable for the study of organizations with novel organizational structures: those composed of independent teams or other innovative forms of organizational structuring.  People's behavior in organizations is best understood in terms of their mental sets-conceptual frameworks-rather than in terms of needs or personality traits.  Major changes in cognitive structure are the result of a basic shift of constructs about natural phenomena.  Considering the infinite possibilities for cognitive structure, organizational assessment is more a matter of ideographic analysis than of measurement.  The study of organizations should be a study of perceptions as much as it is a study of observable social structure.

T1  - Investigating occupational stress: a methodological approach: SUMMARY
AN  - 227214073
AB  - One of the main methodological difficulties in carrying out research in the field of occupational stress is the use of pre-designed health and behavioural questionnaires. This has the serious disadvantage of either not including important stressors at work or distorting the importance of those that are included. This article describes the use of the Repertory Grid technique in identifying sources and manifestations of occupational stress which overcomes this obstacle. A detailed description of the Grid technique as it was applied to air traffic controllers is provided.

T1  - An Analysis of Three Managerial Jobs Using Repertory Grids
AN  - 194217234; 00124307
AB  - Accurate job analysis is the basis of industrial psychology, and it should provide the framework for decisions about: 1.  selection, 2.  training, 3.  job evaluation, and 4.  organization.  A repertory grid approach to job analysis is a technique that can be applied to the jobs of individual managers.  This technique enables a psychologist to produce a representation of an individual's ''mental model'' pictured as a mental map or dendrogram.  The subjects were 3 managers employed by a large chain of bakers in the north-west of England.  The repertory grid approach was used to define the 3 management jobs.  The results showed that the repertory grid analysis allowed for a more systematic and quantitative analysis, as it identifies: 1.  the most demanding tasks, 2.  the most important qualities, and 3.  the number and nature of any underlying trends.  The repertory grid analysis has the advantage of producing a pictorial representation of a job by plotting the position of each part of a job by using the loadings on the first 2 components as if they were references on a map.

T1  - The Repertory Grid in Action: How to Use It to Conduct an Attitude Survey
AN  - 214110878; 00109517
AB  - The Repertory Grid Technique (Repgrid) may be the best method of discovering people's attitudes or beliefs.  Using the Repgrid as the basis for conducting an attitude survey is the most ambitious of its uses.  While the Repgrid is a survey, it is not a questionnaire.  Managers responding to the survey rate their peers on a numerical basis, according to common traits in handling people.  Then, strong points and weaknesses are listed, along with traits that make some different from others.Analyzing the results is more difficult and is the most crucial phase in the entire exercise.  A 7-step procedure facilitates analysis: 1.  Number the forms.  2.  Score the forms.  3.  Extract top data.  4.  Extract tail data.  5.  Sort and categorize data.  6.  Compare top and tail data.  7.  Produce summary pen pictures.Feeding back the results of the survey in a face-to-face meeting with management is preferred to a written report.  Participants may receive a written summary.  Total time spent should take around 36 hours.

T1  - The Study of Personnel Management as an Occupation, Using Repertory Grid
AN  - 214814717; 00101081
AB  - Part of a research project which examined personnel management as an occupational specialism is described.  The main intention is to understand personnel managers' values and beliefs and the settings which give rise to them.  This objective can be approached through the occupational community or the organizational context of personnel work.   This research draws on Kelly's personal construct theory by examining the way 20 personnel specialists in 4 organizations interpret and make meaningful the roles of others encountered in their working world.  These constructs were discovered by using a repertory grid technique, and results from the 4 organizations are compared.  Possible explanations are suggested of the ways in which the personnel specialists studied coped with values that conflict with their own and of how they are able to integrate within their organization's culture.  Results suggest that the way managers are subjected to competing pressures produces an adaptive response.

T1  - An Exploration of Occupational Role: An Exercise in Team Development
AN  - 214808375; 00093895
AB  - Personal Construct Theory (PCT), coupled with implications and repertory grids, was used to analyze the attitudes and perceptions a team of professional valuers in a British Local Authority held about their positions and functions.  The study sought to discover why officers with identical functions and similar qualifications and experience evaluated analogous situations and reached radically different conclusions.   Computer analysis of the grids used did point up constructs and elements with very little consensus among the officers.  The data provided were of little use to the officers themselves and required trained interpretation and application.  In the case study, a more effective and consistent team of professionals was formed when differences in personal constructs were pointed out to them.
