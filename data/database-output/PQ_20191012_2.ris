T1  - Prompting conceptual understanding with computer-mediated peer discourse and knowledge acquisition techniques
AN  - 229771824
AB  - Numerous computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools have been designed to facilitate group discourses on the Web. However, previous studies noted that participants did not value online conferencing as a method for conducting in-depth discussions, and instead considered this method as merely scratching the surface of the issues involved. Therefore, the teachers must moderate the online discourse to add value to the success of CMC. This study presents a methodology that uses knowledge acquisition techniques during online discourses to increase student conceptual understanding and evaluation skills. The methodology explains the conceptual frameworks of individuals and the conceptual relationships between student peers. Active database triggers then are applied to automatically monitor the conceptual relationships and to moderate online discourses between student peers. Student reactions demonstrated that discourses mediated by the repertory grid analysis technique helped group members not only promote common conceptual understandings but also to approach the level of conceptual understanding of the teacher.

T1  - Improving team performance using repertory grids
AN  - 217099848
AB  - This paper seeks to explore how repertory grids can be used to address IT team performance issues. The technique is introduced along with the process of creating and analyzing repertory grid data. The approach is to explore the application of the repertory grid technique to team performance issues. An example focused on eliciting the essential soft skills needed by programmers to effectively interact with IT team members is illustrated. To researchers, the main benefit of this paper is that it introduces a technique that is easy to use, enables the researcher to easily determine the relationship between constructs, is free from researcher bias, and can be applied to a wide variety of team-related research studies. This research presents a means by which human resource managers, hiring personnel, and team leaders can easily determine essential skills needed on the IT teams of the organization, thereby deriving a "wish list" from key IT groups as to the desired non-technical characteristics of potential new team members.

T1  - THE USE OF RGT (REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE) IN MEASURING THE IMAGE OF SHOPPING CENTERS: REVISTA DE ADMINISTRAÇÃO E INOVAÇÃO REVISTA DE ADMINISTRAÇÃO E INOVAÇÃO
AN  - 883063317
AB  - With the number and variety of shopping centers in Brazil increasing, there is greater pressure on the practitioners of marketing to better understand how consumers choose shopping centers both as shopping and leisure areas. This study suggests that the technique of the repertory grid (RGT) is superior to other techniques which are generally used to evaluate the dimensions which a consumer uses to evaluate a shopping center. The main advantage of the repertory grid is that the dimensions through which an object is evaluated and its relative importance are directly obtained from the consumer with no interference from the researcher. The study introduces a number of necessary basic concepts to understand the application of the technique and the theory on which it is based, the psychology of personal constructs developed by Kelly (1955). The study also presents a number of hypothetical examples of how to apply the technique and its main limitations.

T1  - Gossip and emotion in nursing and health-care organizations
AN  - 197381746; 16206920
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between gossip and emotion in health-care organizations. It draws on findings from empirical research exploring the characteristics and function of gossip which, to date, has been a relatively under-researched organizational phenomenon. A multidisciplinary approach was adopted, drawing on an eclectic range of discipline-based theories, skills, ideas and data. Methods included repertory grid technique, in-depth interviews and structured diary records of work-related gossip. The sample comprised 96 qualified nurses working in a range of practice areas and organizational settings in the UK. Template analysis was used to integrate findings across three phases of data collection. The findings revealed that gossip is used to express a range of emotions including care and concern about others, anger, annoyance and anxiety, with emotional outcomes that include feeling reassured and supported. It is the individual who gossips, while the organization provides the content, emotional context, triggers and opportunities. Nurses were chosen as an information-rich source of data, but the findings may simply reflect the professional culture and practice of nursing. Future research should take into account a wider range of health-care organizational roles and perspectives in order to capture the dynamics and detail of the emotions and relationships that initiate and sustain gossip. Because gossip makes people feel better it may serve to reinforce the "stress mask of professionalism", hiding issues of conflict, vulnerability and intense emotion. Managers need to consider what the emotions expressed through gossip might represent in terms of underlying issues relating to organizational health, communication and change. This paper makes a valuable contribution to the under-researched phenomenon of gossip in organizations and adds to the growing field of research into the role of emotion in health-care organizations and emotion work in nursing.

T1  - The sorting techniques: a tutorial paper on card sorts, picture sorts and item sorts
AN  - 196917601
AB  - Although sorting techniques (e.g. card sorts) are widely used in knowledge acquisition and requirements acquisition, they have received little formal attention compared to related techniques such as repertory grids and laddering. This paper briefly describes the main sorting techniques, and then provides a detailed tutorial on one variety (repeated single-criterion sorts), using a worked example. Guidelines for choice and sequencing of techniques are given, both in relation to varieties of sorting technique and in relation to other techniques. It is concluded that the sorting techniques are a valuable part of the elicitor's methodological toolkit. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing patients' preferences for treatments for angina using a modified repertory grid method
AN  - 230465738
AB  - A current popular theme in medicine concerns whether and how patients should be involved in treatment choice. Assuming patient involvement is desirable, how should one go about eliciting preferences? A variety of quantitative and qualitative methods exist that may be used for this purpose, one of which is the repertory grid method. This method involves eliciting constructs (reasons) for preferences through comparing sets of three options. This method allows the structured elicitation of the reasons behind individual preferences, but also, when used with generalised procrustes analysis (GPA), allows aggregation of individual data to reveal general preference patterns. In this study the repertory grid method was used to examine patient preferences for angina treatments with the goal of, first, gaining some understanding of general patterns of patient preference, and second, examining the likely utility of the technique in this setting. A sample of 21 patients with mild and stable angina from two general practices in Norfolk, UK was interviewed using the repertory grid method to elicit the constructs underlying their preferences amongst seven angina treatments (including 'no treatment'). Individualised questionnaires were then produced and sent to the patients for self-completion, which required rating the extent to which each construct was relevant for each treatment (scored on visual analogue rating scales). Analysis of the ratings, using GPA, showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: 'some treatment' versus 'no treatment', and drug treatment versus surgical treatment. While some treatment was generally preferred to no treatment, individuals varied in preference for drug treatments or surgical treatments. Although the latter were generally perceived as 'effective' they were also perceived, for example, as 'invasive', 'frightening', related to 'negative experiences', and being more appropriate for when symptoms are severe ('proportionate'). We consider the implications of these results for involving patients in choosing amongst treatments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Identity change and the human dissection experience over the first year of medical training
AN  - 230467568
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore identity change in medical students over their first year of medical training, particularly in relation to their experience of human dissection. Each of our four participants completed two repertory grids at the end of term one and, again, towards the end of term three. One grid tapped their identity construction, and the other, their experience of human dissection. Our participants were optimistic about becoming similar to a doctor they admired and, towards the end of term three, began to develop a stable identity as a medical student. Their identity constructs involved three common themes: dedication, competence, and responsibility. However, the data also revealed negative reactions to the demands of training, such as feeling driven and stressed. Three major themes were apparent in their experience of human dissection: involvement, emotional coping, and ability. Our participants' dedication to their studies was reflected in their appreciation of the need to become involved actively in the process of dissection but some experienced an erosion of their self-confidence and perceived some of their colleagues to have lost much of their enthusiasm for learning. Emotional coping could be an additional challenge within this context and their reaction tended to reflect distancing processes previously identified in the literature. In all, we see a development of a vulnerable sense of professionalism alongside a frustration of losing out potentially on wider aspects of personal development due to the high work demands.

T1  - Parental coping with sudden infant death after donor insemination: case report
AN  - 211897861; 15665018
AB  - We report the case of an artificial donor insemination couple experiencing sudden infant death of their 8-month-old child. Six months after the incident, the couple were investigated by means of an extensive interview, a repertory grid investigation and the Family Assessment Measure, as well as at 6 years after the incident by an extensive interview. The results show the importance of the diagnosis of male infertility and the preceding fertility treatment for coping with the death of their child. Six months after the incident, acute feelings associated with bereavement are mixed with feelings of anger and shame, apparently due to the experience of infertility. However, secrecy and shame associated with male infertility and donor insemination make it impossible for the couple to communicate their feelings to each other or to friends and relatives; furthermore, they decline psychological counselling. Repertory grid investigation and the Family Assessment Measure point to significant problems within the partnership. Six years after the incident, the couple's relationship is destabilized and both partners plan to divorce. We suggest a possible link between donor insemination secrecy and difficulties with coping. We discuss implications for couple counselling and emphasize the necessity for an improved legal framework for donor insemination in Germany.

T1  - Preception of bread: A comparison of consumers and trained assessors
AN  - 194415167
AB  - The main objective of this study was to investigate consumers' perception of bread and to compare the used vocabulary with descriptive attributes used by a trained panel. Perceived appropriateness of breads were also studied and related to the sensory perception. Seven different types of bread were chosen for the study. The breads were presented to 30 consumers, and the repertory grid method was used to obtain information about sensory perception and appropriateness of use. The breads were also presented to a trained sensory panel performing sensory profiling. Multivariate analyses of the data showed that the latent structure in consumers' perception of a selection of breads was similar to the latent structure in a trained panel's perception of the same breads. For verbal description of the texture, the 2 panels used many identical words. Moreover, multivariate analyses revealed the relationship between consumers' perception of the breads and the appropriateness of use. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Consumer perceptions of novel fruit and familiar fruit: A repertory grid application
AN  - 222672711
AB  - To explore how consumers perceive novel and familiar fruit, repertory grid interviews were carried out with 60 New Zealand women. Participants described their perceptions of nine fruit varying in familiarity. The data analysis established a two-dimensional stimuli space that separated samples with respect to familiarity and the amount of preparation required. Fruit that was familiar was characterised as being well liked, easily available in shops and by a number of different use situations. The primary association with novel fruit was that it was expensive. The participants could not readily think of use situations for fruit they were unfamiliar with. Consumers were separated into groups according to the trait of food neophobia, which pertains to an individual's stable propensity to approach or avoid novel foods. When comparing the most neophobic (n = 14; avoids novel foods) and most neophilic (n = 14; approaches novel foods), individuals perceptual differences were uncovered pertaining to which of the fruit were considered novel and to the suitability of some usage situations (cooking and for children). This finding contributed to the growing evidence of the relationship between food neophobia and consumers' everyday food-related behaviour. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Destination brand images: a business tourism perspective
AN  - 212678257
AB  - Most studies of destination brand images have been conducted from the perspective of the leisure tourist. This study identifies brand images from a business tourist perspective (people visiting destinations for business meetings, incentive events, conferences and exhibitions) and tests their relationship with perceived quality and commercial criteria. Data on the brand image attributes associated with 15 UK destinations promoting themselves as business tourism centres were collected via repertory grid analysis from a sample of 25 organisations using business tourism facilities. A self-completion questionnaire was used to measure managers' ratings of the perceived quality of each destination and the commercial criteria used to select a destination. The data were analysed and the content analysis identified eight clusters of brand image attributes. Subsequent factor analysis identified three underlying dimensions - overall destination attractiveness, functionality, and ambience. While all three were correlated with perceived quality, commercial criteria were dominated by a destination's functional rather than ambience attributes.

T1  - Leading with integrity: a qualitative research study
AN  - 197366841; 15588012
AB  - This research paper gives an account of a study into the relationship between leadership and integrity. There is a critical analysis of the current literature for effective, successful and ethical leadership particularly, integrity. The purpose and aim of this paper is to build on the current notions of leadership within the literature, debate contemporary approaches, focussing specifically on practices within the UK National Health Service in the early 21st century. This leads to a discussion of the literature on ethical leadership theory, which includes public service values, ethical relationships and leading with integrity. A small study was undertaken consisting of 18 interviews with leaders and managers within a District General Hospital. Using the Repertory Grid technique and analysis 15 themes emerged from the constructs elicited, which were compared to the literature for leadership and integrity and other studies. As well as finding areas of overlap, a number of additional constructs were elicited which suggested that effective leadership correlates with integrity and the presence of integrity will improve organisational effectiveness. The study identified that perceptions of leadership character and behaviour are used to judge the effectiveness and integrity of a leader. However, the ethical implications and consequences of leaders' scope of power and influence such as policy and strategy are somewhat neglected and lacking in debate. The findings suggest that leaders are not judged according to the ethical nature of decision making, and leading and managing complex change but that the importance of integrity and ethical leadership correlated with higher levels of hierarchical status and that it is assumed by virtue of status and success that leaders lead with integrity. Finally, the findings of this study seem to suggest that nurse leadership capability is developing as a consequence of recent national investment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 231389614
AB  - Crudge and Johnson's article Using the Information Seeker to Elicit Construct Models for Search Engine Evaluation assesses the suitability of using repertory grid technique as a multi-dimensional evaluation instrument of Web search engines. Repertory grid technique is a structured technique for eliciting both the conceptual content embodied in an individual's mental model and the relationships which exist among these concepts. Bipolar statements - good-bad - were elicited from 10 first-year undergraduates in the Department of Information and Communications at Manchester Metropolitan University. It was determined that the repertory grid effectively derived categories of user-determined evaluative constructs, thus providing a user-centered evaluative instrument.[Publication Abstract]

T1  - Uncovering your customer's hidden needs
AN  - 224666707
AB  - The way companies 'listen' to their customers is changing as managers realise end users are often unable to articulate their needs and focus groups seldom lead to breakthrough product ideas. A vanguard of product developers has addressed the issue of hidden needs - needs which customers themselves do not always recognise - and some companies are using novel ways to capture them. The questionnaire has several drawbacks. The traditional fallback after questionnaires is the focus group. Repertory grid analysis was developed by psychologists to understand how individuals think and to uncover their cognitive 'maps', a technique that is ideal for developing new product ideas. Observation is another very effective hidden needs analysis technique. Another technique is the contextual interview.

AB  - This article reports on the use of a repertory grid as a tool for studying conceptual systems in line with Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory. Using 7-point construct continua, students rated the positions of major developmental theorists on various bipolar constructs (e.g., nature-nurture, continuity-discontinuity) representing salient developmental issues. The results of objective testing, combined with the findings from a brief survey of students' attitudes toward repertory grid assignments, indicated that a repertory grid is a useful pedagogical strategy in terms of organizing course content, encouraging students' conceptual understanding, and challenging students intellectually. Moreover, when conjoined with the opportunity for classroom discussion, this technique stimulates active participation in the learning process.

T1  - The complexity of consumers' cognitive structures and its relevance to consumer behavior
AN  - 196326818
AB  - Consumers make numerous product decisions every day. This decision-making process depends on the information processing style employed. A key factor here is the complexity of a consumer's cognitive structures (i.e., the sophistication of the structures used to organize information). Although this construct, cognitive complexity, holds much promise for consumer behavior, several questions remain to be answered and were addressed by the present research. First, the results of the present research indicate that the Repertory Grid, developed in social interaction contexts, is a reliable instrument for measuring cognitive complexity in the consumer behavior domain. Second, the results further suggest the presence of a generalizable - as well as a context-specific - component of cognitive complexity. The generalizable component of cognitive complexity indicates that these knowledge structures are transferable across related product categories. As such, cognitive complexity is likely to impact consumer processing of product information and advertising messages. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Repertory grid analysis: An application to the measurement of destination images
AN  - 236409017
AB  - The objective of this paper is to demonstrate and evaluate the use of repertory grid analysis (RGA) in the context of a study of destination brand images. The study explored the components of destination brand image from a business tourism perspective. RGA was used to identify the constructs used by events managers in a sample of 25 UK organisations to characterise the brand images of 15 UK towns and cities. The study identified eight categories of brand image attribute. Factor analysis reduced these to three higher level dimensions, an overall destination attractiveness dimension and two sub-dimensions: functionality and ambience. The paper concludes with a discussion of the benefits and limitations of RGA as a technique for measuring destination brand images and argues that it offers significant advantages over alternative techniques with regard to image measurement.

T1  - Mapping cognitions to better understand attitudinal and behavioral responses in appraisal research
AN  - 224884262
AB  - Perceptions are important in determining performance appraisal system success. The growing body of research in this area has clearly documented the differences in perceptions between appraisers and appraisees. However, many of these findings are predominately based on aspects of the system in judging its overall effectiveness and rely heavily on self-report questionnaire responses with weak methodological rigor. Not much is known about the deeper cognitive perceptions of appraisers and appraisees in better explaining their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. This paper breaks away from conventional questionnaire-generated perceptions and applies a unique clinical cognitive mapping methodology called the repertory grid technique to elicit the personal constructs of how real respondents perceive appraisal systems based on their real-life experiences. The method allowed the investigation to go much deeper than past research into the core perceptions that influenced respondents' attitudes and subsequent behaviors. Though the findings showed some commonality in personal constructions of appraisal systems with those found in the literature, new constructs, core perceptual dimensions, and collective cognitive maps were elicited for the very first time, opening up new questions and issues for further research. Implications to theory and practice are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The dimensions of management team performance: a repertory grid study
AN  - 218423197
AB  - Teamwork is a key feature of work in organizations and a central question in the extensive literature on teams concerns the ways that team performance can be measured. This paper summarizes the concept of team performance and, focussing on management teams, reports the results of an extensive study through 60 repertory grid structured interviews with members of management teams suggests seven factors that represent team performance. The factors are: team purpose; team organization; team leadership; team climate; interpersonal relations; team communications; and team composition. An eighth factor, team interaction with the wider organization, is suggested for theoretical considerations and is included in an eight-factor model of team performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A constructivist model for evaluating postgraduate supervision: a case study
AN  - 213734462
AB  - This paper presents a new constructivist model of knowledge development in a case study that illustrates how a group of postgraduate students defined and evaluated effective postgraduate supervision. This new model is based on "personal construct theory" and "repertory grid technology" which is combined with interviews and group discussion. It is argued that this approach leads to a more meaningful interpretation of results and facilitates formative evaluation and professional development of supervisors. In this case study we discuss details of our evaluation method and its benefits and limitations. We explain how this approach enables both supervisors and students to participate actively in research and development activities, to develop their own constructs or theories of effective supervision, and to communicate their suggestions for improvement. Further applications of this constructivist model to postgraduate supervision practice and to research in higher education are suggested. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A repertory grid evaluation of a multidimensional theory of courage
AN  - 305174778
AB  - Courage is a fairly common expression of behavior, with benefits for society as well as the courageous actor. As often as it is identified in the media or literature, little research has directly studied courage as it has been difficult to define. Courage has been described as comprising three types: physical courage (i.e., physical action for a socially valued goal), moral courage (i.e., authentic expression of one's values and beliefs despite possible risk), and vital courage (i.e., perseverance to maintain physical or emotional well-being). This study sought to evaluate laypersons' views of the nature of courage. Two main questions were asked: how is courage conceptualized by people in everyday life, and how do other factors such as age and gender relate to views of courage? College-age adults and adults over age 40 completed a repertory grid measure used to compare courageous situations. The grid measure provided scores of construct integration (i.e., variability of intensity), level of differentiation among elements and constructs (i.e., construct ordination, element ordination), cognitive differentiation (i.e., matching score), and meaningfulness of ratings (i.e., extremity analysis). By categorizing the courageous situations provided by participants according to the type of courage suggested, moral courage was most frequently reflected by the situations. Younger and older adults were consistent in listing situations of moral courage most often, followed by vital and physical courage, respectively. One hypothesis was that there would be age-related differences on the repertory grid scores due to changes associated with aging and gaining life experience. The analyses demonstrated no differences among older and younger participants for the repertory grid scores, except for an effect of age on extremity analysis scores. A second hypothesis was that differences would be detected according to gender; this was not supported by analyses. Participants for this study were obtained from classes at Michigan State University, community centers in East Lansing, Michigan and personal contacts of the researcher. The lack of difference due to age or gender suggests few differences between how people conceptualize courage according to scores of construct integration or cognitive differentiation.

T1  - The changes in ex-mental patients attending a psychiatric rehabilitation program with holistic care
AN  - 305051477
AB  - It is well documented that most patients with chronic mental illness suffer from severe psychosocial dysfunction. Recent studies also suggest many patients have spiritual problems. A review of the present psychiatric rehabilitation services in Hong Kong shows that it lacks structured rehabilitation programs especially the informal community programs in the form of self-help group (SHG). Furthermore, spiritual support is also neglected in most if not all of the psychiatric rehabilitation programs.    This research aims to study the changes and the related factors in ex-mental patients attending the psychiatric rehabilitation program with holistic care organized by a Christian non-government organization, which has successfully formed 12 SHGs within the past 10 years. This holistic care rehabilitation program is characterized by a SHG approach with a holistic care content in which spiritual support is much emphasized. Spiritual intervention is in the form of hymn singing, Bible reading, personal sharing and intercessions.    A mixed research method with three studies was adopted to examine the changes of the participants in the program. In the first study, a non-equivalent group design was used to measure the changes indexed by objective outcome indicators. A control group (N = 154) with no randomization but matched with the experimental group (N = 109) was used for comparison. In the second study, in-depth interviews with the participants (N = 20) were used to measure their subjective experiences in the group. In the third study, repertory grid tests based on 19 informants were used to measure the changes in terms of the self-identity system.   The findings in Study 1 showed that those who joined the SHG had more friends and more satisfaction socially than those without joining the group. Duration of attendance, religious and group involvement were three key factors related to the change of functioning of the group members. In Study 2, the subjective experiences of the participants were positive and they perceived positive changes in the group. SHG was also perceived as a useful means to reduce loneliness and enhance rehabilitation. The findings based on the repertory grid method in Study 3 showed that there were perceived positive changes in the self-identity system of the informants. They perceived themselves more similar to the ideal self and an ideal ex-mental patient while more dissimilar to an unsuccessful person.    An integration of findings from all three studies suggests that the program was beneficial to their participants in the physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects with dominant positive changes in the psychosocial dimension. The findings also underscore the therapeutic forces available in small groups and the positive effect of the long-term nature of SHG. Furthermore, the study indicates the importance of spiritual intervention and its therapeutic values in psychiatric rehabilitation.

T1  - The brand images of tourism destinations: A study of the saliency of organic images
AN  - 220604538
AB  - Assesses the relative saliency of image attributes associated with history, heritage and culture in shaping the perceptions of places as tourism destinations. Such images tend to have been formed over a long period of time and result from exposure to communication processes largely outside marketing's core sphere of influence such as education, literature and the arts. Images formed in this way are referred to in this paper as organic images. The research used the repertory grid technique developed by George A. Kelly in the context of Personal Construct Theory combined with depth interviews to elicit the attributes associated with the images of 25 destinations in the UK. The study identified 11 categories of image attribute. Those associated with a destination's history, heritage and culture were found to be the second most salient category. The implications of these findings are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 236359160
AB  - Teachers' beliefs influence the acceptance and uptake of new approaches, techniques, and activities, and therefore play an important part in teacher development. Consequently, trainers running teacher education courses should consider encouraging participants to think about their personal beliefs and theories about teaching before providing input. This article proposes the use of an instrument designed to elicit teachers' beliefs based on Kelly's (1969) theory of personal constructs, using an adapted version of his repertory grid technique.

T1  - Studying Trust in Virtual Organizations
AN  - 224074942
AB  - The core objective of this article is to introduce the repertory grid technique as a powerful methodology into research on trust in virtual organizations. This technique is particularly capable of yielding insights into the subjective meaning of trust. Virtual organizations have been chosen as our empirical field because the literature shows a broad consensus that trust is one of the most important success factors for the initiation, development, and continuation of activities in these types of hybrid regimes. On the basis of a discussion of the literature on trust in networks and virtual organizations, we present our empirical study of two Swiss virtual organizations. It reveals that the emergence of trust in virtual organizations depends strongly on personal bonds and shared experiences in the practical realization of projects, whereas generalized rules and contracts play only a supplementary role. Localized and experience-based commitments as well as the proactive behavior of the partners involved are identified as decisive denominators of trust. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Eliciting and analysing employees' expectations of a merger
AN  - 231482823
AB  - The merger of the head offices of two public service organizations in Sweden was used to examine difference in the meanings that employees attach to the organizations involved and their expectations of the new merger organization, nine month prior to the merger. A two-stage methodology was used, combining the repertory grid method with a survey questionnaire based on the elicited constructs. Predictions from a social constructionist perspective on culture and social identify theory were largely confirmed. The results showed that both groups expected one of them to be dominant after the merger. Member of this organizations expected to change very little, while employees in the non-dominant group felt themselves to be threatened by the prospect of merger and this led them to emphasize theory own distinctiveness. The findings suggest that the success of the integration process after a merger is critically dependent on how employees of mergers partners perceive the culture of the organizations involved and the expectations they have of the new organization. The study has practical implications for how to manager the merger integration process.

T1  - Using repertory grid to identify intangibles in business plans
AN  - 221918849
AB  - The assessment of intangibles in business plans by investors is an important factor of recent interest, particularly in the evaluation of early-stage technology-based ventures. On one hand, investors are challenged to properly assess new opportunities. At the same time, entrepreneurs or innovators face the formidable task of communicating what is, sometimes, nothing more than just an 'extraordinary' idea. In such situations, the decision to continue with the due diligence process, and finally to invest, is based frequently on those aspects that are intangible. In an attempt to reveal some of the intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs, an investigation was conducted using repertory grid, a technique based on personal construct psychology. Five venture capitalists and five entrepreneurs were interviewed. Evidence was found for the importance of intangibles during the investment-decision process of early stage technology-based ventures. For these ventures, the consideration of only tangible criteria is not a guaranteed predictor of success. The repertory grid technique makes a significant contribution to the identification of intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs.

T1  - Assessing attitudes toward dying and death: Psychometric considerations
AN  - 209689720
AB  - In the 50 years of research in death attitudes, clear gains have been made in the measurement of death concerns and competencies, leading to the development and validation of several scales whose more extensive use could improve the conceptual yield of research in this area. In this article, we review these promising instruments, focusing on nine general questionnaires for measuring death anxiety, fear, threat, depression, and acceptance, and four specialized measures of death self-efficacy and coping, readiness for death, and desire for hastened death. We also offer an orientation to non-questionnaire based techniques for the assessment of death attitudes (e.g., narrative measures, repertory grids, behavioral observations, death personifications and drawings), and close with a note on international developments that hold promise for improved cultural awareness of the role of death attitudes in human life.

T1  - The use of repertory grid analysis to elicit salient short-break holiday destination attributes in New Zealand
AN  - 217443448
AB  - Repertory grid analysis was developed almost 50 years ago, but its application in destination image research has been rare. The technique was used to identify 17 attributes deemed salient to New Zealanders, when differentiating domestic short-break holiday destinations. These were then compared to those attributes used in 84 previous destination studies, as well as with results from personal interviews with tourism practitioners. A number of differences between the repertory grid findings and practitioner opinion confirmed the value of seeking consumer input when developing attribute lists for use in structured surveys. While both the repertory grid findings and practitioner opinion showed a general consistency with the range of 100+ attributes used in the literature, key differences highlighted the importance of the New Zealand domestic travel context. The article attempts to demonstrate the efficacy of repertory grid, an economical technique that has been underused by tourism market researchers.

T1  - Behavioral activity associated with onset in chronic tic and habit disorder
AN  - 214424343
AB  - Seventy-six people (aged 18-62 years) diagnosed with either a chronic tic disorder or a habit disorder, entering a treatment study, kept a baseline daily diary for at least ten days, noting tic frequency and activity at time of onset. Together with an evaluator, participants completed a form ranking three high-risk activities where the tic or habit was likely to appear, and three low-risk activities where the tic was absent or barely present. Subjective appraisals distinguishing the two types of activities were also elicited and their relevance to the tic was measured on a seven-point scale using an adaptation of Kelly's repertory grid technique. Overall, the most frequent high-risk and low-risk activities were, respectively, passive attendance and physical activity. There were, however, significant differences in types of high-risk activities amongst the tic and habit disorders. Conversely, appraisals of the high-risk activities seemed to center on negative evaluations of tenseness, boredom, dissatisfaction, and disinterest.

T1  - Making the Processes of Designing Explicit Within an Information Technology Environment
AN  - 722540557
AB  - In this paper, technology is described as involving processes whereby resources are utilised to satisfy human needs or to take advantage of opportunities, to develop practical solutions to problems. This study, set within one type of technology context, information technology, investigated how, through a one semester undergraduate university course, elements of technological processes were made explicit to students. While it was acknowledged in the development and implementation of this course that students needed to learn technical skills, technological skills and knowledge, including design, were seen as vital also, to enable students to think about information technology from a perspective that was not confined and limited to `technology as hardware and software'. This paper describes how the course, set within a three year program of study, was aimed at helping students to develop their thinking and their knowledge about design processes in an explicit way. An interpretive research approach was used and data sources included a repertory grid `survey'; student interviews; video recordings of classroom interactions, audio recordings of lectures, observations of classroom interactions made by researchers; and artefacts which included students' journals and portfolios. The development of students' knowledge about design practices is discussed and reflections upon student knowledge development in conjunction with their learning experiences are made. Implications for ensuring explicitness of design practice within information technology contexts are presented, and the need to identify what constitutes design knowledge is argued.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Investigating the meaning of supplier-manufacturer partnerships: An exploratory study
AN  - 232594270
AB  - Supplier partnerships can be the key in enhancing the performance of manufacturing companies. Consequently, partnership has been strongly recommended by academics and practitioners alike. Surprisingly, the concept of partnership is only poorly understood. Many authors have identified the advantages that it can bring but far less has been published on the attributes of partnership itself. What is known is that partnerships are close relationships and thus, the level of relationship closeness is an appropriate angle for exploring supplier partnerships. Research was conducted using the repertory grid technique with an exploratory sample of ten managers from four German engineering companies. It revealed that supplier partnerships are very different from other forms of relationship and identified five distinct attributes of partnerships. These findings have a number of implications for both practitioners and researchers.

T1  - Studies on information as an asset II: repertory grid
AN  - 224648638
AB  - This article presents findings from five repertory grid interviews conducted in early 2001 to identify attributes of information as an asset. Repertory grid is a technique developed by George Kelly based on his theory of personal constructs. Personal construct theory (PCT) assumes that individuals are their own `personal scientists' who mentally represent the world around them. The method was used to enable key senior executives in information-intensive UK organizations to identify attributes of information assets considered to be significant by them for their business. The findings are not intended to be representative, but give an insight into the thinking of these key executives and their approaches to managing information assets. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Exploring teachers' instructional design practices from a systems design perspective
AN  - 740300641
AB  - Curricular changes in higher vocationaleducation have rendered teachers' instructionaldesign activities increasingly important. Usinga repertory grid technique, this paper sets outto analyse current design activities of tenteacher trainers. Their actual approach iscompared with an instructional systems design(ISD) approach and related to innovativeteacher roles. Teachers' activities show animbalance in two ID phases, that is problemanalysis and evaluation. The results suggestthat they attempt to translate curricular goalsdirectly into concrete lessons and they payrelatively little attention to evaluation. Inline with this finding, they underrate the twoinnovative teacher roles of the `diagnostician'and the `evaluator'. It is argued thatimbalanced or incomplete design approaches andperceived roles may hinder innovation ineducation. Implications for the support ofteachers' design activities are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Perceptual dimensions of performance management systems in the eyes of different sample categories
AN  - 233231044
AB  - Past appraisal perception research identify the differences in satisfaction levels towards system effectiveness. But none of them probe into the mental psyche of their respondents to uncover the true core deep-seated perceptual dimensions that influence all other constructions. This study uses the repertory grid technique to elicit personal constructs of how practicing managers experience appraisals in their own organizations. Results show that different sample categories held fundamentally different cognitions when evaluating the effectiveness of performance management systems. Implications to theory and practice are outlined.

T1  - (Rethinking) the measurement of service quality in museums and galleries
AN  - 236407147
AB  - Measurement of service quality has been instrumental in making service industries more competitive. The new era of accountability in the museum sector means that if museums and galleries are to be successful in growing visitor numbers and developing greater access, they must learn more about the factors that are important to visitors' evaluation of service quality. The aim of this study is to understand the concepts that are significant to visitors engaging in museum experiences. A repertory grid study was conducted among visitors to 11 prominent London museums; the results suggest that there is greater variety of factors influencing their decisions than is measured by traditional approaches to visitor satisfaction surveys.

T1  - Measuring brand associations for museums and galleries using repertory grid analysis
AN  - 212077349
AB  - This paper is a contribution to the literature on the branding of cultural institutions. In particular it focuses on visitor motivation in the field of museums and galleries. Measurement of visitor motivations and associated brand strength of cultural institutions is a relatively new concern for marketers. The need to develop further understanding of how best to market museums in the twenty-first century motivates this research. Repertory grid analysis was used as the survey method in order to get data that were "rich" in terms of concepts, but also malleable in terms of statistical analysis. The results of an exploratory study of museum brand associations are reported, along with a discussion of the method of repertory grid analysis that was used to obtain the data. A total of 11 museums in London were targeted, with a special focus on the Tate Gallery.

T1  - Spirituality and Cardiovascular Risk
AN  - 756930069
AB  - This study extended current research linking spirituality to health by investigating the relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic spirituality and cardiovascular risk factors. Participants included 111 healthy males and females, ages 28 to 63. Measurements consisted of the Lifestyle Assessment Questionnaire (LAQ), a version of Kelly's Repertory Grid, hematological analysis, and blood pressure. A greater sense of spirituality was associated with lower cholesterol risk ratios (total cholesterol/HDL) and triglyceride levels. In addition, the structural or organizational characteristics of intrinsic spirituality were associated with several other hematological measures. Further research will help clarify the association between mechanisms underlying spirituality and health, including susceptibility to cardiovascular disorders.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Steps Across the Border – Cooperation, Knowledge Production and Systems Design
AN  - 2259953788
AB  - The computer support of cooperation andknowledge production across sociallydistributed activity systems has become animportant topic in the context of the discourseon ``knowledge management''. The present articlewill draw on concepts of cultural-historicalactivity theory to discuss the problem of howthe notion of ``knowledge'' is conceptualized andimplicitly implemented in computer systems tosupport knowledge management, often neglectingthe social embeddedness of knowledge productionin everyday work practices. From the point ofview of cultural-historical activity theory wewould propose to look upon the generation ofknowledge as a process embedded in sociallydistributed activities that are constantlybeing reproduced and transformed in and betweenspecific communities of practice. We willpresent a model of cooperation that relatesprocessual and structural aspects of jointactivity. Methodologically, it draws on theanalysis of unexpected events in the course ofjoint activity. Our model also proposes to useforums for co-construction to make visibledifferent perspectives in the process ofsoftware design. The concept of cooperativemodel production is highlighted as a means tomediate, not to eliminate, differences ofperspectives involved in the course of systemsdesign. An empirical example will be given inwhich the repertory-grid technique is used tovisualize similarities and differences ofpotential users' viewpoints and requirements inearly stages of systems design.

T1  - The repertory grid technique: A method for the study of cognition in information systems
AN  - 218117283
AB  - Recent studies have confirmed the importance of understanding the cognition of users and information systems (IS) professionals. These works agree that organizational cognition is far too critical to be ignored as it can impact on IS outcomes. While cognition has been considered in a variety of IS contexts, no specific methodology has dominated. A theory and method suitable to the study of cognition - defined as personal constructs that individuals use to understand IT in organizations - is Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory and its cognitive mapping tool known as the repertory grid (RepGrid). This article expounds on the potential of this technique to IS researchers by considering the variety of ways the RepGrid may be employed. The flexibility of the RepGrid is illustrated by examining published studies in IS. The diagnostic qualities of the RepGrid and its mapping outcomes can be used for practical intervention at the individual and organizational levels.

T1  - Facilities management in medium-sized UK hotels
AN  - 228363501
AB  - The paper explores the application and value of facilities management concepts in medium-sized UK hotels. Using the results of recent research into the extent and context of application of facilities management in hotels, some apparent advantages of the approach are identified. Facilities management is not a term commonly applied in hotels and the paper considers its value in this field. The hotel manager is in the business of generating revenue from space. If this space is well managed, in a strategic manner, there is considerable scope for improving not only revenue, but also profit. The research uses personal construct theory and repertory grid analysis to identify the aspects of managing facilities which are perceived as important by the owners/managers themselves. A model is then developed of the suggested application of facilities management within the medium-sized hotel sector.

T1  - A two-dimensional model of cognitive empathy: An empirical study
AN  - 305585985
AB  - This study was designed to investigate the validity of a proposed theoretical model of cognitive empathy. The model consists of a circumplex with two separate constructs free to vary independently of one another, creating a contingency table: Altruism (A) on the X-Axis, measuring the ability to see similarities between self and other; and Cognitive Complexity (CC) on the Y-Axis, the capacity to see differences.    Four interpersonal relationship styles were hypothesized to result from the combination of A and CC: Cognitive Empathy—high scores on both A and CC. This is the quadrant of resonant understanding and describes the “I-Thou” relationship. Psychopathy or a less malevolent Expedience—high scores on CC but low on A, describing a contractual, contingent style characterized by the “I-You” relationship. Extremely low scores on A would indicate a more antisocial stance.  Co-Dependence—low scores on CC and high on A: a state of emotional confiscation characterized by the “I-We” relationship, without much of an “I.” Narcissism—low scores on both A and CC, suggesting an incapacity to decenter and reflect. It is characterized by an “I-It” relationship style.    A convenience sample of 344 subjects was solicited by direct mail, and obtained from two formal university subjects pools—a large state university and a large private Catholic university.    The study relied on a correlational design, augmented by hierarchical regressions and a 2 x 2 MANCOVA. To determine if the model was correct, the independent variables of Altruism (a subscale of the Helping Orientation Questionnaire) and Cognitive Complexity (measured by the 4 x 6 Repertory Grid) were examined for their relationship to the key dependent variables: Cognitive Empathy, four subscales of Co-Dependence, Primary Psychopathy, and Narcissism. Several additional measures were added to assess discriminant and convergent validity: Authoritarianism (CC); Splitting (Narcissism), Receptive Giving (Expedience); Empathic Concern (A); and seven subscales of the Love Attitudes Questionnaire. The Crowne Marlowe was added to control for social desirability; age and gender were also used as control variables.    The results of the study did not support the model as measured. Altruism appeared to measure what it purported to measure, yielding positive relationships with Empathic Concern and Perspective Taking, and negative relationships with Psychopathy, Personal Distress, and Splitting. Cognitive Complexity, on the other hand, contrary to previous studies, was positively related to Splitting and unrelated to Authoritarianism, suggesting that the 4 x 6 Repertory Grid did not measure Cognitive Complexity, a potential failure of construct validity.

T1  - Comparing managers' mental models of competition: Why self-report measures of belief similarity won't do
AN  - 222370308
AB  - In their study designed to investigate the relative impact of 'task and institutional influences on managers' mental models of competition,' Daniels et al. (2002) elicited cognitive maps using 2 complementary ideographic mapping procedures: a card-sort technique and a variant of the repertory grid. Drawing on research into the cognitive processes underpinning similarity judgments, it is argued that this approach to the comparison of cognitive maps suffers from a number of severe limitations which are likely to bias the results in favor of the research hypotheses under test, thus leading to increased type I errors.

T1  - Body experience and mental representation of body image in patients with haematological malignancies and cancer as assessed with the body grid
AN  - 218910849; 11780798
AB  - The domain of body image plays a central role in the quality of life of patients with haematological malignancies and metastasized cancer, since the disease itself as well as the enrolled therapies interfere with psychological and bodily well-being. We approached this highly subjective field by using the repertory grid technique and hypothesized that patients would display a restricted body image, focusing on functional aspects of the body. In all, 55 in-patients (27 men, 28 women, M age = 45.7 yrs, N = 46 with haematological malignancies, N = 9 with metastasized cancer), at the time of initial diagnosis, were included in the study and assessed with the Body Grid, an instrument specifically designed by us for the exploration of body image. The data were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) and construct categorization. Further, 42 chronic tinnitus sufferers (20 male, 22 female, M age = 46.5 yrs) served as a comparison group. Based on the constructs elicited, six construct categories were formulated in the sense of a first attempt of a hierarchical model (emotion, control, activity, strength, function, appearance). The central constructs (373 construct pairs) were assigned to these categories by three inter-raters. The categories appeared in the following order of frequency: function (27.1%), emotion (20.4%), strength (20.1%), activity (15%), control (10.2%) and appearance (7.2%). PCA indicated that the patients mainly demonstrated a restricted view of their body. In the tinnitus group, the most frequent category proved to be activity (21.3%), closely followed by function (21.1%) and control (20.9%). The body image was also restricted (PCA). The restriction of body image, together with the specific construct choice, seen in the haematology and cancer patients reflects the existential threat of the disease and may serve as a coping strategy. The high percentage of emotional constructs may mirror the patients' need for further support. The distinct distribution of construct categories in the two different patient samples supports the applicability of the proposed preliminary model.

T1  - Priority setting in agricultural research: beyond economic surplus methods
AN  - 216173795
AB  - This article examines the issue of priority setting in Third World agricultural research organizations, for those research sectors and topics which - mainly because of the difficulty of quantifying benefits - are outside the domain of economic surplus and benefit/cost techniques. The issue is redefined as one of processing ill-structured decisions, i.e., decisions in which there is no unique, identifiable, objectively optimal solution. The implications of this for the concept of rational action in this field are explored, and the results used to define a practical approach. This centres on a radical review of the possible options and criteria in priority setting, using four techniques (challenge groups, repertory grid, creativity techniques and flow charting). The final section of the article examines the decision-making aspects of these techniques in three priority-setting contexts of increasing difficulty: within a department, where the issue is essentially one of technical choice between competing research lines; within a major institute or research sector, where there is substantial competition for resources; and in an institute or sector which is facing a crisis of resources or relevance.

T1  - Personal constructs, childhood sexual abuse and revictimization
AN  - 218937939; 11589329
AB  - Within the theoretical framework of Ryle's Procedural Sequence Object Relations Model and Kelly's Personal Construct Theory, this study investigates sex-role polarization of incest survivors and the centrality of abuse within survivors' constructs of men that may contribute to revictimization. Repertory grid methodology was used with 40 female survivors of childhood sexual abuse and 28 non-abused women. Grid measures and psychometric measures were compared between groups of women who had and had not experienced childhood sexual abuse, revictimized and non-revictimized survivors, and survivors who had and had not experienced incestuous abuse. Results showed significant differences between survivors and non-abused women, with survivors having higher levels of depression and perceived distress, lower self-esteem and higher self/ ideal self discrepancy. Hypothesized differences in sex-role polarization were not found. There were few differences between revictimized and non-revictimized survivors, although revictimized survivors rated 'self now' as more powerful than non-revictimized survivors. No differences were found between survivors who had and had not experienced incestuous abuse. In addition to the value of exploring personal constructs, a range of models need to be considered in understanding revictimization and women's construal of men. The implications of using repertory grid methodology for research and clinical work are discussed.

T1  - Analysis of repertory grids in clinical practice
AN  - 218680538; 11593952
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper illustrates the use of several different forms of analysis of repertory grid data, using a case study of a client who completed repertory grids at various stages of therapy. METHOD: Participants in a survivors' group completed grids before and after therapy and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Grids from one of the participants, who had been sexually abused as a child, are presented using different levels of analysis: visual inspection of the raw grid; analysis of dissimilarities between pairs of elements or constructs; hierarchical cluster analysis of elements and constructs both separately and combined; principal components analysis; biplot representation of elements and constructs combined; multidimensional scaling analysis and unfolding analysis. The latter two methods also provide ways of presenting a combined analysis of a number of grids. Computer packages are reviewed, and SYSTAT commands are presented to perform the analyses. RESULTS: The review of methods illustrates how different levels of analysis can usefully back up clients' own accounts of progress through therapy, from detailed analysis of individual ratings in the raw grid, through analyses that pull out structural patterns at the expense of detail, to the broad sweep provided by methods that combine data from a number of grids. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of repertory grids completed at various stages of therapy can provide useful qualitative information on progress, but can also provide some simple quantitative measures (such as Self-Ideal Self discrepancy as a measure of self esteem) to track progress. Different forms of analysis can be informative, highlighting different aspects of progress, but also allowing checks on adequacy and goodness-of-fit of particular analyses.

T1  - Understanding patients' preferences for treatment: the need for innovative methodologies
AN  - 1778769946
AB  - Treatment selection is now much more consumer driven than in the past. However, there is a need to develop investigative methodological approaches that are sensitive to differences in patient preferences if full account is to be taken of what the patient sees as the best option in terms of different possible treatments available for a particular condition. Previous attitude research has been criticised because it does not provide insight into reasons why people hold different preferences or beliefs. A methodology is described which allows people to describe their concerns and values associated with different treatment options in their own words. This is the repertory grid method of eliciting personal constructs used in conjunction with generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA). An example of the use of this methodology is provided, drawn from research directed towards understanding people's beliefs about genetic technologies. A possible application of the method to understanding treatment preferences related to type 2 diabetes is also discussed. It is concluded that the use of innovative methodologies is essential if our understanding of patient preferences regarding treatment options is to have a significant impact on patient quality of life.

T1  - Assessment of the effects of user characteristics on mental models of information retrieval systems
AN  - 231524512
AB  - This article reports the results of a study that investigated effects of four user characteristics on users' mental models of information retrieval systems: educational and professional status, first language, academic background, and computer experience. The repertory grid technique was used in the study. Using this method, important components of information retrieval systems were represented by nine concepts, based on four IR experts' judgments. Users' mental models were represented by factor scores that were derived from users' matrices of concept ratings on different attributes of the concepts. The study found that educational and professional status, academic background, and computer experience had significant effects in differentiating users on their factor scores. First language had a borderline effect, but the effect was not significant.

T1  - Toward an expert assessment of intangibles in technology-based new ventures
AN  - 304783440
AB  - This dissertation documents three initial phases of an investigation into intangible aspects of new ventures. The assessment of intangibles, which are often present in startups, is a topic of recent interest (Stewart 1997, Clement, Hammerer and Schwarz 1998, Shepherd and Douglas 1999, Sullivan 1999, Smart 1999, Boulton et al 2000), particularly during the early-stage investment-decision process of technology-based ventures. On one hand, investors are challenged to properly assess new opportunities. At the same time, entrepreneurs or innovators face the formidable task of communicating what is, sometimes, nothing more than just an “extraordinary” idea. In such situations, the decision to continue with the due diligence process, and finally to invest, is based frequently on those aspects that are intangible.    Phase I of the research was a pilot study to elicit vocabulary from investors and determine their need to assess intangibles. A group of twelve investment-decision experts were interviewed. The interviews were content analysed. The results of the content analysis suggest that there is a need on the part of both investors and entrepreneurs to improve their assessment of intangibles when making an investment decision.    Phase II used Repertory Grid, a technique based on personal construct psychology, to identify intangibles used by experts when assessing or communicating new venture opportunities. Five venture capitalists and five entrepreneurs were interviewed. The results reveal a total of 149 constructs. Principal component analyses indicate that each interviewee identified only a few major areas of emphasis in his or her thinking. Furthermore, a cluster analysis revealed that each investor had his or her own way of conceiving the intangibles in a given proposal. Next, an extremity analysis identified each person's most meaningful constructs. As a result of these analyses, the operation of intangibles during the investment-decision process is evident. From this phase, what is remarkable is the contribution of Repertory Grid technique to identify intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs.    Phase III involved the development of a fuzzy expert system as a diagnostic tool to assess intangibles in new technology-based ventures. The system was validated with five experts in investment-decision making. The results show a promising future of this tool when used for assisting entrepreneurs and investors to assess venture viability. Finally, the results of this research could also open the door for this technique to be applied in other areas such as: scientific proposals, requisition of grants, and assessment of employment candidates.

AN  - 213154959
AB  - Extensive literature exists into discrimination in selection in the fields of psychology, social psychology and sociology. This research focuses mainly on domestic appointments and does not consider the nature of selection for international appointments. Discusses the findings of a study into potential gender bias in international manager selection systems. In particular, it discusses the use of repertory grid technique to elicit the personal constructs of selectors for international appointments and to assess how these might influence the numbers of women entering international management positions.

T1  - How do directors of public health perceive leadership?
AN  - 197359138
AB  - This study examines how directors of public health (DsPH) perceive effective leadership. Kelly's (1955) repertory grid technique is used. A total of 13 out of a possible 14 DsPH in one NHS region of England were interviewed. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were carried out. The findings show that male DsPH rate their leadership ability more highly than do female DsPH. Qualitative analysis produced a number of categories of constructs, some of which are perceived to be indicative of effective leadership, these being working for others, personal attributes, vision and innovation, and courage and integrity. Some categories appear to be applicable only to the UK (or to public health) and not to the existing dominant US models of leadership. In general, DsPH perceptions of effective leadership converge with current theories; most specifically the UK-based theories. This study therefore refutes any simple extrapolation of US theories of leadership to UK health organizations.

T1  - Perceived applicant fit: Distinguishing between recruiters' perceptions of person-job and person-organization fit
AN  - 220143471
AB  - There were 2 studies conducted to assess whether recruiters form distinguishable perceptions of applicant person-job (P-J) and person-organization (P-O) fit. The first study used repertory grid methodology with actual recruiters and mock applicants to demonstrate that knowledge, skills, and abilities are relied on more frequently to assess P-J fit, and values and personality traits more often to assess P-O fit. Study 2, which involved actual recruiters making decisions on applicants in a field setting, supported P-J and P-O fit perceptions as 2 discernable factors. Study 2 also found that both types of perceived fit offer unique prediction of hiring recommendations. Taken together, these results present compelling evidence that recruiters discriminate between applicants' P-J and P-O fit during early interviews.

T1  - A Study of the Perceptions of the Labour Market by Human Resource Managers in the UK Hotel Industry: A Cognitive Approach
AN  - 1972081260
AB  - It is reasonable to assume that if the labour market is the dominant force in labour management then the significance of the role of the human resource manager lies in the position it holds at the intersection between the external and the internal market, with recruitment as the joining process. This paper describes a qualitative investigation of hotel human resource managers' perceptions of their labour market environment using the process of recruitment as a vehicle to explore cognitive processes. A cognitive task analysis was completed which utilised four interview methods: task diagram; knowledge audit; simulation interview; and repertory grid. The findings show that the HR managers conform to the appellation of 'expert' in that they would use few and simple rules in making decisions. They also assume that the labour market will always provide and that perceptions of what goes on inside the organisation are quite separate. In other words there is both an industry and in organisational perspective at work.

T1  - Religious commitment and the construal of sources of help for emotional problems
AN  - 218915027; 11003370
AB  - Religious commitment as an influence upon seeking help for psychological problems has not received the same level of research attention as variables such as sex, ethnicity and cultural background. The construing of members of a group of committed UK Christians was investigated, regarding their receiving such help from a variety of different helpers, professional and non-professional, secular and spiritual. Each participant was asked to interpret the factors statistically identified from construct and element relationships in a repertory grid that they had completed. Their commentaries formed the data for a qualitative thematic analysis, which gave rise to four main themes. From these, a tentative model is discussed. Possible implications for the acceptance of service provision by the substantial minority groups of religiously committed people in the UK are considered in the light of this model--and in the light of the further research that would be needed to establish it.

T1  - Measurement of tourists' images: The repertory grid approach
AN  - 217442339
AB  - Repertory grids are suggested to be an underused method of eliciting tourists' images of potential destinations. However, repertory grids possess great potential in the field of tourism research. As opposed to methods commonly used in studies of image, the repertory grid approach is couched in well-tested psychological theory and avoids bias inherent in alternative methods due to prespecification of study attributes.

T1  - Repertory grid technique - An interpretive research framework
AN  - 237021142
AB  - A study examines some of the underlying assumptions, research objectives and practical applications of the repertory grid technique (RGT) in consumer research. It explains why the use and evaluation of the RGT should be grounded in the assumptions of the theory from which it derives, George Kelly's personal construct psychology (PCP), and examines the way in which it is both congruent with and can contribute to the development of the emerging interpretive paradigm in consumer research. The specific questions that the RGT can help to answer about consumer behaviour experience are identified and illustrated with the findings from a short empirical study. Overall, it is argued that when the RGT is employed within the guidelines of PCP it provides a useful interpretive research framework for exploring some of the similarities and differences in the content and structure of consumers' subjective meaning systems.

T1  - Exploring consumer product construct systems with the repertory grid technique
AN  - 213434911
AB  - Over the last 25 years the repertory grid technique (RGT) has been widely employed as a qualitative method in market research. Originally developed by George Kelly (1955) to explore the subjective meanings that people attach to their world, the RGT has particularly been adopted in consumer research for examining consumers' perceptions of products and services, most notably in means-end chain analysis. Despite its relative widespread use, however, the full potential of the RGT as a qualitative method has yet to be realised, either in market research in general or consumer research in particular, for a number of reasons.  The aim of this paper is to show how the RGT and theory can be employed in market research as a qualitative method for exploring the nature and form of the network of subjective meanings that consumers attach to their consumption experiences, what are termed here consumers' product construct systems (PCSs).

T1  - Personal constructs of male survivors of childhood sexual abuse receiving cognitive analytic therapy
AN  - 218934262; 10874477
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed whether male survivors of sexual abuse identified with their abusers rather than their child- or victim-selves and failed to identify with men in general or with their victims, following abusive 'acting out'. Changes in both identification and symptomatology were assessed following cognitive analytic therapy. DESIGN: A patient series within-participants design was used. METHOD: A repertory grid methodology examined four male survivors self-construals before and after therapy. Measures of symptomatic distress, depression, self-esteem and distorted beliefs related to childhood sexual abuse were also obtained. RESULTS: Before therapy, patients showed little identification with the child-selves, men in general and ideal-selves. Two heterosexual patients identified with their abuser(s) whereas another, homosexual, patient negatively identified with his abuser. Patients did not identify with their victims following aggressive 'acting out'. After therapy, identification with the abuser reduced markedly; identification with victim- and ideal-self increased. Depression and distorted beliefs declined. CONCLUSION: Male survivors tend to identify with abusers and disavow their victim-hood. Sexual orientation may predict identification patterns. Cognitive analytic therapy may be a promising method of enabling survivors to integrate their abuse experience and reduce their commitment to the abuser role.

T1  - Manufacturing change The role of performance evaluation and control systems
AN  - 232350894
AB  - This paper reports on research currently being undertaken into change in performance evaluation and control systems. Case study research involving the use of repertory grids, in-depth interviews, and observation has been undertaken to examine the impact of these systems on behavior and the potentially problematic nature of change in performance evaluation and control systems. This contrasts with previous research which has often assumed that such systems can be treated almost as easily manipulable independent variables. The case study illustrates the ways in which performance evaluation and control systems provide a formative context which means that change can be difficult to achieve and requires an understanding of the cultural assumptions underpinning both current and desired systems.

T1  - PE teachers teach the way they were taught: asset or handicap?
AN  - 214330614
AB  - The repertory grid shows how closely number patterns for effective and ineffective teachers are related. In conversation, student teachers are invited to describe similarities and differences between these teachers from a variety of different teaching/coaching contexts. From over seventy such interviews currently conducted, the majority of responses from PE student teachers have focused on effective coaches from their past-coaches who were instrumental in their success as athletes. Occasionally, PE teachers or other teachers from student teachers' pasts come up as model teachers. It is these teachers, rather than the coaches, that offer the framework to understand the principles and concepts of effective teaching in PE. The coaches, though inspirational in a particular sport, rarely offer the strategies for teaching that transfer into effective PE teaching.

T1  - The personal construction of death in anorexia nervosa
AN  - 218898922; 20220800
AB  - This paper reports a study concerned with an attempt to understand the manner in which individuals at high objective risk of death through their own behaviour, understand the phenomenon of death, and their own death. It is an extension of an earlier empirical study (Warren et al., 1994) which in turn, set out to test a hypothesis advanced by Jackson and Davidson (1986) that disturbed death ideation was aetiologically significant in anorexia nervosa; and an extension of earlier work on death constructions, and death education (Warren, 1984, 1989). Constructs were elicited from a sample of hospitalized sufferers of anorexia nervosa. These participants also completed the provided construct, Death Threat Index. Repertory grids were analysed for the information they yield concerning death constructions in sufferers of anorexia nervosa. Various quantitative measures were also derived and compared with similar measures from a control group.

T1  - Using Repertory Grids to Conduct Cross-Cultural Information Systems Research
AN  - 208157767
AB  - As more business is being conducted internationally and corporations establish themselves globally, the impact of cross-cultural aspects becomes an important research issue. The need to conduct cross-cultural research is perhaps even more important in the relatively newly emerging and quickly changing information systems (IS) field. This article presents issues relating to qualitative research, emic versus etic approaches, and describes a structured, yet flexible, qualitative research interviewing technique, which decreases the potential for bias on the part of the researcher.

T1  - The meaning of mothers' and nurses' interactions during a child's hospitalization
AN  - 304631259
AB  - When a child becomes acutely ill and requires hospitalization, there is mounting evidence that parents' relationships with professionals are one of the key factors that result in outcomes such as anxiety, frustration, conflict, stress, mistrust and dissatisfaction (Dixon, 1996; Jarrett, 1996; Knafl & Dixon, 1984; Tiedeman, 1997). The purpose of this study is to understand how mothers perceive and attribute meaning to their interactions with nurses in the hospital setting, and to examine nurses' perspectives towards parents that impact on their interactions with parents in this setting. Personal Construct Theory (PCT)(Kelly, 1955) and the accompanying repertory grid technique was used to examine the personal constructs through which mothers and nurses viewed, interpreted, and thereby gave meaning to their interactions in the hospital setting. Twenty mothers and 20 nurses completed repertory technique rating grids, a brief qualitative questionnaire and a demographic instrument during the acute, unexpected hospitalization of their child (ages 3months to 12 years). Results indicate that the meaning mothers attribute to their interactions is primarily influenced by their evaluation of the nurse. Mothers' evaluation of their interactions with nurses (either effective or ineffective) influenced their ability to participate in their child's hospitalization and their decision to do so either actively or passively. Similarly, nurses' interactions were influenced by their evaluation of mothers. Nurses classified mothers as either “difficult” or “ideal” based on whether they felt valued and listened to by the parent. Ideal parents were those who were perceived to listen carefully and follow the nurse's directions. Difficult parents were those who were perceived to not comply with nurses' expectations, to which nurses responded with rigid and controlling approaches to these parents. Group analyses revealed that mothers valued nurses who were able to convey a sense of trust and respect towards them and convey a sense of equality in their relationship with them. In contrast, communication with parents, and control over the parents and the child's care were the most pervasive and consistent themes in the meaning systems of the nurses, yet how these themes were viewed and interpreted varied according to complexity and according to specific people and situations.

T1  - Strategic groups and cognitive groups: Theoretical comparison and empirical analysis in the homebuilding industry
AN  - 250290835
AB  - Strategic group is a group of firms in an industry that follow the same or a similar strategy. This concept has been widely used for researchers as an intermediate tool between the analysis of the industry as a whole and the individual analysis of competing firms. Its main use is a tool to help managers cope with their bounded rationality and reduce uncertainty. What this thesis tries to answer is whether these researcher-defined groupings are really relevant for the strategy-making process and whether they correspond with managers personal taxonomies of competitors.    To do so, we analyze the Homebuilding Industry in a small town developing two parallel empirical studies. First, we identify the strategic groups that integrate that industry following the traditional economic-approach—cluster analyses. Moreover, using repertory grid technique, we analyze managers' mental models in order to obtain their personal taxonomies of competitors. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that both categorization of competitors, research-defined and manager defined are convergent, suggesting a direct and indirect causation between them.    The dissertation is organized as follows: In the first chapter we justify the Thesis and show our objectives and hypothesis to be contrasted. The second chapter makes a literature review on strategic groups. The third chapter does the same review on cognitive groups literature. In the fourth chapter we present an integrative model that compares the Positioning School—strategic groups—with the Cognitive School cognitive groups. The fifth chapter shows the results of the first empirical analysis carried out on the Homebuilding Industry. The sixth chapter presents the managers' vision of their industry. The seventh chapter compares both classifications of competitors. The eight chapter presents the conclusions and implications of the findings for academics and managers.

T1  - Characteristics of well-performing organisations in Singapore
AN  - 226850629
AB  - Very little is known about the characteristics of successful organizations which are located in the East. This paper seeks to add to this limited knowledge and, in so doing, uses 6 of Singapore's most successful companies as its sample. The repertory grid technique is used to analyze case studies relating to each of the 6 companies and appropriate concepts are developed. The results suggest that the 6 selected companies have become successful as a result of: 1. being customer oriented, 2. creating new products to enter existing markets, 3. having a clear vision and direction, 4. offering career training, and 5. having a disciplined informal professional atmosphere. Some of these characteristics may seem, on the surface, to be similar to those identified in Western organizations. Indeed, such values might be useful in interpreting the way that different organizations illustrate the 5 identified characteristics.

AB  - In this study the Repertory Grid interview technique was used to investigate constructs of leadership held by a group of male and female senior managers from within hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Units (SPCUs) in the UK. The themes that emerged were compared with those from existing research models of leadership. Results: men and women in these roles describe different constructs of effective leadership. The women's constructs that emerged were predominantly transformational, while the men's were predominantly transactional Themes were also identified in this study, which differed from previous studies, i.e. those of political and environment awareness and the valuing of others' views regardless of their status. These themes do not feature highly in other research, and may be in response to the environment within which hospice and specialist palliative care functions.

T1  - Strategic investment decision-making: Managerial judgement on project risk and return
AN  - 1031187045
AB  - Until recently little attention has been given in Accounting and Finance literature to the problem of linking the results of financial evaluation techniques such as Net Present Value (NPV) and Shareholder Value Analysis (SVA) to managers' cognitive evaluation of strategic factors and the risk profile of projects.  Various authors have called for research in this area, but very little has so far been published.  This paper reports on a field-based study carried out in the logistics industry. It builds on earlier research, which elicited constructs that managers use to assess project risk using a repertory grid technique.   It provides an insight into how a project risk analysis process can be linked with project returns in strategic investment appraisal (SIA) in a divisionalised organisation. An action research approach was taken to develop a decision matrix to link the risk assessment results to expected project returns as an aid to management in strategic investment decision-making. It is now embedded in the investment appraisal procedures across the European group of companies that participated in the research. It is suggested that the framework adopted in this experimental study is transferable to other organisational contexts.

T1  - Towards a relational self: Social engagement during pregnancy and psychological preparation for motherhood
AN  - 219218128; 10641295; 20106049
AB  - This study works towards a theoretical model of the relational self derived from the intensive examination of a small number of case studies of women going through their first pregnancy. The study is idiographic, grounded in the women's own accounts of the experience, and it is primarily qualitative. It employs interviews, diaries, repertory grids and interpretative phenomenological analysis. The theory argues that pregnancy can accentuate the symbiotic relation of one's perception of self and others, and that this aids psychological preparation for mothering. Increasing contact with key others can be psychologically informative: the woman may perceive herself as becoming more like key other(s); close involvement with existing family can facilitate the woman's preparation for taking on the new role of mother. The model is explicated with illustrations from the women's accounts. It is then discussed in relation to the existing literature.

T1  - What is this thing called geoscience? Epistemological dimensions elicited with the repertory grid and their implications for scientific literacy
AN  - 194901457
AB  - To appropriately prepare informed citizens, science education must improve scientific literacy, which includes public understanding of science. Therefore, students' perceptions of science is considered a fruitful area of research. This kind of investigation should elicit the images of science that students are likely to hold when they enter the science classroom.

T1  - Project risk assessment: A European field study
AN  - 204773608; 00740386
AB  - A field-based study was carried out in the logistics industry, which followed an innovative action research approach, operationalized by the use of focus groups and repertory grids.  Using a repertory grid technique, constructs were elicited, which managers used to explain the riskiness of a particular project, compared to other projects of a similar type that they had knowledge of from past investment appraisals.  The results include a set of 12 project risk attributes, a project typology which defines 3 types of projects, each with a set of weightings reflecting the relative importance of the attributes to the participants.  These provide a useful insight into managers' perceptions of the risk attached to strategic investment projects in a large European group.  In addition to the context-specific results, conclusions are drawn regarding the use of repertory grids as a framework for a risk assessment technique in other organizational settings.

T1  - The changing management agenda for primary heads
AN  - 234392526
AB  - There has been unprecedented change in education in the last decade since the 1988 Education Reform Act (ERA), and there is little doubt that these changes in education are causing profound shifts in the nature of the headteacher's role. This paper investigates the role of the primary headteacher and is based on empirical evidence from experienced primary headteachers, all working in schools in one of the South Wales Valleys. There are three qualitative methods used to gather data: participant observation, interviews and Repertory Grids. The results from the empirical data reveal many changes in the role of the primary head; the most significant of the changes is an increase in management activities. The changes do not support the view that an increase in management leads to a deprofessionalisation; the core values of the primary head remain rooted in their philosophies of education. The results support the view that there is a changing management agenda, a new professional emerging, a New Public Management where the head manages but retains the core education sector values and visions.

T1  - Using qualitative research to establish SME support needs
AN  - 213451207
AB  - SMEs are both users of marketing research and subjects of market research. There is clear evidence that the decision processes in such firms often render the products/services designed for medium and large firms in appropriate. One of the major suppliers of services to the small firms sector is the business support infrastructure. This includes agencies associated with business start-up/expansion and their management consultancy services concerning marketing, finance, insurance, and risk management. This paper considers the value of using in-depth qualitative research to establish the unique features of business support required by small firms. In addition to a review of recent studies that have adopted ethnographic, repertory grid and cognitive mapping qualitative approaches in this context, the paper presents the results from a specific study where the repertory grid procedure was used to establish the risk management practices of high technology firms.

AB  - A model is presented for analyzing the subcontractor's risk elements in construction refurbishment projects.  The system is based on the use of fuzzy set theory with the fuzzy set representing the overall weighted average rating of refurbishment contractors criterion for the selection of subcontractors.  A prototype knowledge based expert system is described, which provides a systematic and objective approach to the selection of subcontractors.  Knowledge elicitation methodology using the repertory grid technique is detailed.  The implementation of a subcontractor selection and appointment model for refurbishment contractors in linguistic terms allows the user to interact with the system in a very friendly manner using natural language expressions.

T1  - Evaluating business information systems fit: From concept to practical application
AN  - 218775279; 01788846
AB  - Attempting to explain information systems success and failure is a complex task. To measure it is perhaps more complex and compounded by difficulties related to the concept of measurement in a social context. The prevalent approach taken to date revolves around the concept of 'fit', as defined by the contingency approach in organizational theory. In reviewing this, a proposal is made for an interpretive approach to measurement. This paper attempts to provide such an approach through the development of a framework that aims to improve understanding for the researcher and practitioner alike. The formative part of the framework seeks to collect data relating to the fit of the information system and its environment along the dimensions of decision making, innovation and information acquisition and distribution. The latter part of the framework uses repertory grids to gain an understanding of both what is perceived as wrong with the system and what is perceived as wanted from the system; the latter acting as a basis for corrective action.

T1  - Repressive coping and self-reports of parenting
AN  - 218652809; 10212738
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether women who possess a repressive coping style (repressors) self-report more positive judgments of their childhood on questionnaire and repertory grid measures compared with non-repressors. DESIGN: Repressors (low anxiety-high defensiveness) were compared with a composite group of non-repressors, containing some low anxious (low anxiety-low defensiveness), some high anxious (high anxiety-low defensiveness), some defensive high anxious (high anxiety-high defensiveness) and some non-extreme scorers. METHODS: Participants completed the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI; Parker, Tupling & Brown, 1979) and a 10 x 10 repertory grid, Self-Identification Form. RESULTS: On the PBI, repressors scored significantly higher than non-repressors on paternal care and significantly lower on paternal overprotection. There were no group differences for maternal measures. On the repertory grid, repressors compared with non-repressors perceived (a) themselves as significantly closer to their father, a woman they like, and their ideal partner, and significantly further from a woman they dislike, and a man they dislike; and (b) their father as significantly closer to a woman they like, a partner/person they admire, and an ideal partner. In addition, repressors were significantly tighter on construing than non-repressors. CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the hypothesis that repressors would rate their interactions with their fathers more positively than non-repressors when allowed to do so on self-report measures.

T1  - Organizational change schemas: An empirical investigation of how health care managers make sense of organizational change
AN  - 304514130
AB  - This research examined the structural properties of individual’s organizational change schemas. An organizational change schema is a particular sensemaking framework that contains knowledge about organizational change, including change attributes and relations among those attributes. Understanding the properties of these schemas is important because existing research suggests that the way individuals think about change influences their responses to it.    Specifically, the present study investigated health care managers’ sensemaking regarding implementation of a quality initiative by examining: (1) the structure and content of organizational change schemas; (2) the extent to which schemas were shared by organizational members; and (3) the nature of the relationship between shared understanding and organizational inertia.    A sample of 28 health care managers from a large hospital in the Northeastern U.S. completed the repertory grid, a method originating in cognitive psychology (Kelly, 1955). This method allowed organizational members to identify meaningful dimensions that distinguished between organizational change attributes while minimizing the imposition of the researcher’s frame of reference. The content and structure of members’ change schemas were also examined using a pre-designed instrument by Lau and Woodman (1995).    Content analysis revealed that in their effort to make sense of organizational change, organizational members rely on a relatively small number of widely shared evaluative dimensions, and a larger number of essentially idiosyncratic dimensions. An analysis of change schemas by organizational level revealed important differences in the way top managers and middle managers make sense of change. The results of cluster analysis indicated that discrete shared organizational change schemas could be identified and meaningfully understood in terms of current and ideal orientations. Contrary to expectations, incongruence between members’ current and ideal change schemas did not give rise to negative emotions. However, incongruence between these schemas was positively related to resistance to change. Comparison of the two methods used in this study suggests that the preservation of the terms and dimensions people themselves use to describe organizational change represents an important consideration for future cognitive-based organizational change research. Implications for theory and practice as well as directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - A commentary by Chinese hotel workers on the value of vocational education
AN  - 215392374
AB  - The open-door policy started by the late Deng Xiao Ping has not only been maintained since his death but under the new Chinese leadership it has been encouraged even further. Because of this China has seen an unprecedented number of tourist arrivals which in turn has led to an explosion in the construction of hotels. However, due to poor vocational educational facilities and staff for hospitality subjects there is a dearth of qualified hotel operatives. A study examines Chinese hotel employees' perceptions of various elements of vocational education associated with the Chinese hotel industry. This was done by asking staff to rank their feelings on a bipolar scale and the results examined using Kelly's Repertory Grid principal components analysis.

AN  - 214802978
AB  - Starting from the viewpoint that career is a gender concept, the author suggests that organizational culture is a key determinant in relation to career paths, fostering success for men, and difficulty for women. Four case study organizations were investigated using repertory grid interviews with men and women managers, group discussions, and documentary evidence. In each case the organizational background, and traditional and current career paths are described, with comments on the extend to which these could be negotiated by women. Respondents outlined what is valued in managers in terms of characteristics and behavior in their respective organizations. All these aspects are linked to the key assumptions underlying each organizational culture. In 3 out of the 4 organizations women faced serious difficulties. Only in NHS Trust with a female chief executive was there close congruity between culture and style, and career paths open to all.

T1  - Expectations of an exercise prescription scheme: An exploratory study using repertory grids
AN  - 2126529876
AB  - Objectives. The study aimed to investigate in depth the personal constructs relating to exercise of individuals referred by their medical practitioner for a 10‐week gym‐based exercise programme. It further aimed to study the expectations of change on these constructs and the extent to which these predicted adherence. A subsidiary aim was to evaluate the usefulness of repertory grid methodology in the exercise context.Design. This was a longitudinal study.Methods. Participants were interviewed at the start of the 10‐week exercise programme. During the interview they completed repertory grids designed to elicit constructs about exercise‐related change. Participants were followed up at three months to check adherence.Results. Three illustrative individual case studies are presented in detail followed by some aggregated analyses. These suggest that expectations of change were very diverse and often overoptimistic. Those who completed their course of exercise had more modest expectations of change than those who failed to complete. They also showed less gulf between their current view of themselves and their view of themselves as they would like to be.Conclusions. The study suggests that having realistic aims and understanding of the outcomes that can be expected from a brief exercise programme is an important predictor of success, but one that may currently be overlooked in the enthusiasm to implement exercise prescription schemes.

T1  - Primary and secondary store-loyal customer perceptions of grocery retailers
AN  - 225143323
AB  - Gaining competitive advantage in retailing requires knowledge of the attributes consumers use to evaluate stores and an understanding of why these attributes are important. Although a number of store-image studies have identified store attributes, evidence suggests that these attributes vary by store type and over time, but no work has considered the most crucial aspects to retailers, namely store loyalty. As no study has examined the links between store attributes and store loyalty, the knowledge remains largely speculative. This article explores this link using Kelly's repertory grid methodology to assess the store images of three UK grocery retailers. Important differences were seen between primary store-loyal customers' perception of their store and secondary store-loyal customers' perception of that store. Implications for retail positioning strategies and the development of store loyalty are discussed.

AB  - School guidance focus: a Hong Kong Study
As schools worldwide pay more attention to pastoral care and pupil guidance research into guidance focus as a school factor and ways of assessing it are still undeveloped. The study reported here aimed at identifying the guidance focus (remedial, preventive or developmental) adopted in Hong Kong secondary schools. In the absence of previous studies, it was necessary to establish criteria of identification. Constructs of guidance were first identified using Kelly's Repertory Grid. This was followed by a questionnaire survey of guidance practices. The findings indicated that case work and developmental group work were useful indicators. The criteria established for assessing schools' guidance focus were the amount of time spent by the school guidance team and the priority they assigned to each indicator. The findings also revealed conceptual and methodological problems in determining school guidance focus and in categorising schools accordingly, thus opening up other areas of research. While specific to Hong Kong secondary schools, the method is reported for its relevance to other school settings.

T1  - An exploration of students' personal constructs: Implications for clinical teaching in psychiatric mental health nursing
AN  - 304422586
AB  - Despite revolutionary rhetoric in the nursing education literature calling for collaborative student centered learning, few opportunities actually exist, particularly in the psychiatric clinical teaching area, to include the voices of student nurses in the scholarly dialogue surrounding their learning. This thesis was designed to understand students' own ways of knowing during their six-week mental health practicums on acute hospital units. A constructivist conceptual perspective and George Kelly's personal construct psychology are the theoretical bases of the research. Qualitative methodology using the case study approach was used to describe the experiences of six Canadian second year nursing students from their own perspectives. Data sources included before and after repertory grids, a questionnaire and audiotape-recorded transcribed interviews. Content was theme analyzed, Vee Heuristic diagramed and concept mapped. The case studies were written collaboratively with students and member checking by correspondence six months after the practicum ended confirmed that the reports authentically narrated the personal construct changes which occurred, or did not occur, as a result of the course. The study spanned three years, included a pilot project and incorporated the resulting student "stories" into a clinical curriculum. The case reports are snapshot portrayals of how student nurses construed the professional activities they observed on hospital units which recently underwent organizational changes. They reflect human faces behind the paradigm shifts occurring in nursing education and health care. The following four overarching themes represent key findings. The research approach invited constructivist teaching. Students' anxiety related more to feeling unable to help than to mentally ill patients. Students felt a lack of inclusion in staff nurse groups. Non evaluated student-instructor discussion time was vitally important. Suggestions for clinical teaching strategies are made to assist instructors in the selection of experiences which can help link university curricula to hospital practicum sites. The research contributes to the conceptualization of how students learn nursing by re-valuing what they bring to clinical experiences, by increasing understanding of what students find engaging or difficult and by developing a pedagogical mode of inquiry which extends clinical instruction beyond demonstration and evaluation to creating a space for student perceptions.

T1  - Perceptions of software quality: a pilot study
AN  - 235083944
AB  - Many software quality initiatives fail because they do not take account of the range of views that people have of quality. New approaches to software quality improvement will not work unless software developers believe in them, no matter how enthusiastic managers may be. This paper reports on a pilot study using the repertory grid technique that found evidence to support these assertions. The study findings justify further work and show that while the repertory grid technique is an appropriate instrument in this area it is resource intensive to apply and may not be practical in a wider study of a representative sample of the IT industry. The paper has practical recommendations for successful introduction of new software quality programmes. These recommendations stress the need for effective communication, leading to a shared understanding of 'quality', and for realistic goals that recognize the pressure of development schedules.

T1  - How Tutors Model Students: A Study of Personal Constructs in Adaptive Tutoring
AN  - 1986936326
AB  - Studies of tutoring are producing rich descriptions of tutorial dialogue but have not                identified constructs that tutors use to classify and discriminate among students for                the purpose of adapting tutoring to student differences. This study investigated five                experienced tutors' personal constructs about students tutored over a significant                period of time. Several tutoring settings and domains were represented. Constructs                used by tutors to discriminate among tutees were identified with repertory grid                interviews and interpreted with the aid of cluster analysis. All tutors judged and                classified students in terms of two underlying dimensions that were similarly                defined, though not exactly alike, across tutors: motivation and intellectual                ability. Tutors' personal constructs and tutorial decisions informed by those                constructs are reported, and implications for programming computer-based tutors are                discussed.

AB  - An investigation was undertaken in a large government business enterprise in a bid to examine the utility of the repertory grid technique in the investigation of organizational culture and to conduct an "audit" of performance culture.  The development of a methodology is described to gauge the rate of up-take of a new culture - from a public service orientation towards a customer service orientation.  Schein's (1990) theoretical framework was adopted in developing a 2-stage approach to the collection of data, which incorporated qualitative (in-depth interviews), and quantitative (survey) methods.  Results indicated that there was progress in the direction of the new culture desired by management.  There were 3 active cultures or groupings, articulated through the language of participants, which essentially mirrored a culture transition: those who had adopted the new culture, those who had partially adopted the new culture, and those who had not adopted the new culture.

T1  - "In the Eye of the Beholder": A New Approach to Studying Folk Theories of Leadership
AN  - 2181259982
AB  - Awareness that questionnaire ratings of leaders may be subject to systematic errors has led to increased emphasis on understanding the perceptual/memory processes underlying leadership ratings. Subordinates may judge leadership effectiveness based on their implicit leadership theories. Folk theories of leadership refers to these deeply felt and idiosyncratic theories of leadership behaviors. Borman's (1983) "Trait-Implication Procedure" based on Kelly's Repertory Grid technique was used to examine the leadership categorization schema of ten senior executives from a wide variety of organizations. Results indicate some association between the folk theories of leadership and the background/experience of the respondent. Implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.

T1  - Behaviours in organization: Chinese world views and perceptions of cross-cultural differences. A study of Hong Kong Chinese working in Canada
AN  - 304389526
AB  - This study inquired into the lived experience of the Hong Kong Chinese in Canada and captured snapshots of their perceptions of cross-cultural differences in organizational behaviour. To provide a base for study, I examined literature on organizational behaviour from the cross-cultural and the Chinese dimensions. To conceptualise how people perceive the world, I reviewed literature on the personal-construct theory and the schema theory.    The study used a qualitative mode of enquiry, with the researcher as an instrument to collect data through the in-depth interview and the repertory-grid methods. The participants, 8 men and 2 women, were either degree-holders or professionals with work experience in the service sectors in both Hong Kong and Canada. The study extracted their world views, which shape their interpretation of reality, from their narratives and work experience in both cultures. I identified 7 meta-narratives shaping the unique world view that differentiate them from Canadians at work; these meta-narratives dealt with: existence, achievement, work, conflict, power, relationship and communication. I also identified 4 major dimensions in modus operandi between these two cultures: planning, cooperation, leadership and controlling.    I adopted the phenomenological-hermeneutic approach to analyse and thematise the data collected through interviews. I also explored through the repertory-grid method the participants' constructs of the role-holders in organizations between these two cultures. The grid data were computed by the Focus programme. These two sets of results were compared and triangulated to increase the study's academic rigour.    The evidence shows that the Chinese perceived significant differences between themselves and Canadians in many dimensions of organizational behaviour. These differences obviously reflected these 2 cultures' underlining meta-narratives--the Chinese perceived Canadians as self-rather than organization-oriented, over-optimistic and carefree, uncommitted assertive, equalitarian, too frank and straightforward competitive in dealing with conflicts and intolerant to inequality. Clearly, their cultural perspective creates difficulty for Chinese working in Canada and Canadians or Western management specialists and educators attempting to work in Chinese societies.    The study concludes with implications for practice for people who work across the cultural line with Chinese, with recommendations on ways to enhance cultural understanding, and with directions for further research.

T1  - The Goldilocks pursuit in organizational selection: How recruiters form and use judgments of person-organization fit
AN  - 304350948
AB  - The Goldlilocks Pursuit describes recruiters' attempts to hire applicants who are "just right" for their companies. Judgments of "just right" include recruiters' perceptions of an applicant's person-job (P-J) and person-organization (P-O) fit. P-J fit has been the traditional focus of selection research, but P-O fit has only recently been investigated as a factor in hiring decisions.    Two studies were conducted to answer remaining questions regarding recruiters' P-O fit perceptions. A qualitative methodology was used in Study One to determine what types of characteristics recruiters use to assess applicants' P-O fit, and how similar these characteristics are across organizations. Thirty-two recruiters from four consulting organizations completed repertory grid interviews (Kelly, 1955) in which they compared video-taped job applicants to determine who had the best P-J and P-O fit. Results indicate both unique and shared predictors of fit perceptions, with more skill and experience characteristics leading to judgments of P-J fit, and more personality and value characteristics relating to P-O fit perceptions. Many recruiters used idiosyncratic preferences to determine both types of fit; however, there was also support for organization-specific and universally desirable characteristics influencing fit perceptions.    Structural equations modeling was used in Study Two to determine the relative effects of P-O fit, P-J fit, applicant-recruiter similarity, and liking on recruiters' hiring recommendations. Recruiters from two organizations evaluated 80 applicants during a regular recruiting cycle. Results indicate that perceptions of P-J and P-O fit are highly related, but are predicted by somewhat distinct characteristics. P-J fit perceptions were the best predictor of hiring recommendations, although P-O fit perceptions were also significant predictors. Results also suggest that perceptions of P-O fit mediate the relationship between perceived applicant-recruiter similarity and hiring recommendations better than does recruiters' liking of the applicants.    Together, these studies provide a comprehensive examination of how recruiters form and use impressions of applicants' P-O fit during the selection process. Implications for improving assessments of fit and how they are used in conjunction with other evaluations of applicants to increase the overall effectiveness of the hiring process intended to find the applicants whose fit is "just right" are included.

T1  - Team performance: using repertory grid technique to gain a view from the inside
AN  - 217098014
AB  - Measuring team performance through use of repertory grid technique is novel; it appears to have some advantages over the use of conventional questionnaires and inventories. Once a set of constructs relevant to a particular team's circumstances is generated, it can be used at regular intervals to measure changes in team performance. A particular set of constructs, though, may have a limited life. As the purpose and processes of a team change, the constructs relevant to that team's performance may need to change with new sets of constructs identified, using the same technique as before. Thus the method of measuring team performance is dynamic, keeping pace with changes in the team itself.

AB  - The repertory grid technique is used as the main research instrument for eliciting drivers' knowledge to explore the factors that have impact on seat belt use.  Principal components analysis identified 5 factors underlying drivers' risk assessments: severity, predictability/foreseeability, fault, frequency/unsafe behavior, and hit/air bag impact.  The results show that the perceived risk and perceived importance of seat belt use are influenced by situational factors: the direction of collision, the location of collision, and the existence of an air bag system.  The implication is that belt use campaigns might be more successful if they focused on modifying perceived risk.

T1  - Understanding the basis of treatment choices for varicose veins: a model for decision making with the repertory grid technique.
AN  - 1770033679
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use the repertory grid technique as a method for identifying and rating the criteria that clinicians use to make a choice between the different treatment options for patients with a common condition such as varicose veins. DESIGN: The "expert panel" consensus method for rating the appropriateness of clinical procedures was modified with an existing psychometric method, the repertory grid technique. To identify the criteria used to decide about treatment, the panel members compared and contrasted a range of nine "treatment prototypes". They were then required to rate each criterion for its relevance to each treatment prototype. SETTING: The panel was selected from different geographical locations in the South Western Regional Health Authority. SUBJECTS: The expert panel was composed of six vascular surgeons, three from teaching and three from non-teaching hospitals; two general practitioners who were also clinical assistants in vascular surgery; and one honorary senior lecturer in general practice. MAIN MEASURES: Decision making criteria were categorised according to their content. Their frequency of replication was noted-that is, how many clinicians used the same criterion. Computer analysis of the rating scores for the nine panel members identified the relative importance of each treatment criterion for each treatment option. RESULTS: 161 criteria for the treatment of varicose veins were elicited from the nine participants. These criteria were wide ranging, from clinical indications (48% of those used), to social (32%), and organisational factors (20%). Clinical indications were more likely to be used when deciding about surgery as a high priority, whereas social and organisational criteria were more likely to be applied in decisions about surgery as a low priority, day case surgery, and cosmetic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The repertory grid technique proved to be effective in modelling decision making for a condition such as varicose veins: its use enabled both the identification of the wide range of criteria underlying the decision to treat and the exploration of the relative importance of these criteria in relation to several treatment options. Its potential as a method for reducing variation in clinical decision making and thus improving distribution of high quality care lies in its ability to pinpoint dilemmas of decision making rather than as the basis for drawing up guidelines to regulate decision making practice.

T1  - Cognitive maps in the analysis of personal change during work role transition
AN  - 229485014; 01204592
AB  - The way in which personal construct psychology and repertory grids can be used to produce cognitive maps is illustrated, and psychological adjustment during the transition from college to employment is analyzed.  Cognitive maps are based on the principal component analysis of repertory grid data and provide a visual representation of the way in which the subjects see themselves in relation to other people and in relation to their construct.  The cognitive maps produced by 2 graduates shortly after entry in employment and 6 months later are analyzed and compared in order to identify trends of personal change.  The case studies show that the analysis of the cognitive maps provides some valuable insights into the way in which graduates change their construction of themselves and of their work environment during the period of transition.

T1  - Cognitive complexity in group performance and satisfaction
AN  - 304271855
AB  - In this study, a comparison was made between the various levels of group cognitive complexity and its relationship to task performance and task satisfaction. The goal of this research is to answer the general question, "Should decision-making groups consist of individuals who are similar in the way they differentiate and/or integrate various stimuli in order to increase performance and satisfaction?"    The preceding research problem was analyzed in a laboratory setting using a 2 x 2 factorial design blocked on the variable, cognitive complexity. The Repertory Grid was used to measure the cognitive complexity of 228 student subjects. These subjects were stratified into groups of three based on their cognitive complexity score on the Repertory Grid (Kelly, 1955). Each group was treated randomly with one of two levels of task complexity (complex or not complex). Moreover, the groups received an imposed group structure that incorporated centralized or decentralized decision-making.    Results indicated that groups consisting of cognitively complex members outperformed groups consisting of noncomplex members. No support was obtained for the two-way interaction between group cognitive complexity and either task complexity or group structure. Support was obtained for the interaction between task complexity and group structure on both task satisfaction measures. The highest satisfaction levels occurred with a complex task in a decentralized structure. In addition, the three-way interaction effect on the task satisfaction scale between group structure, task complexity, and group cognitive complexity was significant. The means, however, were not in the predicted direction. For cognitively simple groups, a complex task with a decentralized structure lead to the highest task satisfaction level; whereas, a less complex task with a decentralized group structure lead to the lowest task satisfaction score for noncomplex members. There were no significant differences for cognitively complex groups when analyzing the three-way interaction between group cognitive complexity, task complexity, and group structure.

T1  - Factors affecting information systems' success
AN  - 233642918
AB  - There is continuing difficulty in achieving success with information systems, particularly in the sense of meeting users' expectations and offers a fresh examination of those attributes of information systems by which users perceive success and failure, and through which they establish their expectations. Existing research literature is reviewed and it is suggested that, in addition to the process and product viewpoint, an important factor in achieving success is the service management perspective. Repertory grid techniques are applied to uncover a total of 43 constructs which relate to users' perceptions of success with information systems in business. These are reduced to 21 attributes which provide the basis of a new assessment and measurement framework, incorporating and augmenting the attributes found in previous work in this area.

T1  - Using repertory grids in management
AN  - 215399890
AB  - Since 1980, many changes have occurred in both the use and the application of the repertory grid technique. Unlike the initial monograph, this paper places greater emphasis on practicalities of completing a grid and the different types of analysis possible than on the applications of the grid. The grid offers a powerful way of quantifying people's attitudes, feelings, and perceptions. It focuses on how an individual focuses on how a single individual understands his or her own world in a particular context.

T1  - A Repertory Grid Test of the Claim That Sense of Landscape Naturalness Is Specific to Culture
AN  - 1987643753
AB  - Repertory grid technique was used to test the claim that sense of landscape naturalness is socially constructed and culturally relative, and the reverse claim that sense of landscape naturalness is underlain by universals of human thought. Participants made judgments of sameness and difference concerning elements in a standard landscape of nine elements. Sample groups represented three cultures at extremes along a continuum of ideology concerning human relations with nature: Euro-Canadian at one end, Vuntut Gwich'in and north Baffin Inuit at the other. Results were consistent with the universalist but not the relativist hypothesis. Although principal factors for the three culture samples differ slightly, a common factor is nested within the variation, and it corresponds to the Euro-Canadian construct (natural x man-made). The study has implications for environmental education and environmental planning.

T1  - Validating a method for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures
AN  - 231420805; 01090536; 02501907
AB  - Cognitive mapping techniques refer to methods used to elicit the structure and content of people's mental models.  There is growing interest in applying these techniques to the study of managers' mental models of strategic management issues.  A new method is suggested for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures, that is based upon recent developments in the cognitive psychology of the categorization of concepts.  The method is evaluated with respect to its psychometric properties against the well established, but potentially cumbersome, repertory grid technique.  The method is demonstrated to have good validity by comparing it with the repertory grid technique.

T1  - Developing a lay model of managerial effectiveness: A social constructionist perspective
AN  - 194217103; 01083636
AB  - A study uses repertory grid interviews and a follow-up questionnaire study to develop a "lay" theory of managerial effectiveness in a large New Zealand public sector organization.  The lay theory is presented as a model with 17 scales and 2 factors descriptive of effective and ineffective managers in the organization.  The 2 factors indicate that effective and ineffective managers in the department are differentiated in terms of their conceptual, and interpersonal abilities.  The effectiveness model shows strong similarity to models of effective management which have emerged in research outside New Zealand.  This similarity is of particular interest given the context-specific nature of the study.

T1  - Feminist Identifications in a Troubled Society
AN  - 1988006207
AB  - This article reports selected findings from a programme of postgraduate research which examined women's identifications with feminism in Northern Ireland. This qualitative study used repertory grids and semi-structured interviews to explore the meanings of feminism with a total of 31 women. It shows how women `s perceptions of feminists have affected their decisions about whether or not to identify themselves as such. The data reported here are from case studies of 26 women. The repertory grids uncovered perceived commonalities and differences between women `s present and ideal selves and feminists, while the interviews revealed some of the conflicts women negotiate in their daily lives and the compromises they                       must
                   
 make in attempts at conflict resolution. A conflicting picture emerges in which many women support feminist ideals but do not identify as feminists because of a negative stereotype of feminists. While this stereotype has specific connotations in the context of Northern Ireland, it seems likely that certain aspects of it, and the ways in which it is used, may apply to other patriarchal and heterosexist societies.

AB  - An analysis identifies the dimensions of a higher customer contact food and beverage operative's job as perceived by managers, supervisors, and operatives and examines within-source and between-source differences in these perceptions.  The analysis uses 2 instruments, the repertory grid and the work profiling system.  It shows a number of distinct dimensions that are defined in terms of the worker behaviors necessary for the job tasks to be performed.  Managers/supervisors and operatives generally agree on a number of dimensions.  The analysis discusses variations occurring both with and between groups as well as implications for the choice of sources of job analysis data and the use of job analysis in a personnel selection and training context.

T1  - Women's view of pubs: A study of methods
AN  - 215863477; 01001079
AB  - Customers' experience of service encounters remains an area blessed with a rich folklore but little fundamental understanding.  A pilot study  explored women's experiences of public houses, and used idographic methods on a small sample of middle-class women: role repertory grids, critical-incident questionnaires, individual comparatively unstructured interviews, and group focus interviews.  Group interviews were most useful for coming quickly to a consensus picture, and the critical incident questionnaires allowed extreme examples of good and bad practice to be explored.  It is concluded that there is considerable variation in what women are looking to find in pubs, but that they agree on their dislike of male-dominated atmospheres in which they are harassed or made to feel unwelcome.

T1  - Subjective constructs and first appraisal in women with breast cancer
AN  - 304168936
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe patterns of personal cognitive constructs and first appraisal in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. A framework integrating the Folkman and Lazarus coping model (1984) and Kelly's Personal Construct Theory (1955) guided this study.    Sixty-two women from five different Italian regional hospitals participated in the study. Subjects were interviewed just prior to breast surgery. Breast surgery consisted of lumpectomy. Personal cognitive constructs were elicited during in-depth face-to-face interviews using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique (Kelly, 1955). First appraisal was measured using a visual analog scale with an investigator developed self report questionnaire. The basis for the questionnaire was Lazarus' three appraisal categories: Challenge, Threat, and Harm/Loss (Lazarus & Folkman, 1985). First appraisal was assessed both as perceived during the interview and as remembered by the subject immediately after the diagnosis. Demographic data were collected using an investigator designed demographic data form. Subjects were interviewed between 1 to 10 weeks following diagnosis. Fifty-two subjects were interviewed prior to the surgery, 10 were interviewed following surgery.    Many events used by the women to elicit their cognitive constructs were similar. The category "Challenge" was referred to by the majority of the women as the most intense at the time of the interview; based on the participant's memory, "Challenge" was also described by the majority as the most intense immediately following the diagnosis. No relationship was found between the participants' demography and category of appraisal. Some differences in the patterns of constructs characterized the subjects within the three appraisal categories.    Three conclusions were drawn: (a) the women generally used some similar typologies of events in construing the meanings of their disease; (b) the women preferred "Challenge" among the three categories of appraisal of cancer; and (c) there were some distinctive features in the patterns of personal cognitive constructs of women who appraised their breast cancer as Harm/Loss, Threat, or Challenge.    This study used a convenience sample of 62 Italian women, therefore the results are not generalizable beyond the participants. An insufficient number of subjects who had had surgery were accrued to the study to determine differences between those who had had surgery and those who had not. It is possible that women who participated had motives that were different than women who may have declined, and/or the physician had motives in approaching the participants. The majority of interviews were held in clinical settings exposed to environmental noise beyond the control of the interviewers. The translation from Italian to English may have caused modifications within the original meanings assigned by the participants. Lazarus's categories of appraisal may assume a different meaning when translated within Italian culture.    This study can be replicated on comparable samples of women across countries to evaluate the role of national cultures upon appraisal and constructs. Longitudinal research is needed to assess changes within constructs from diagnosis through to surgery, and finally, experimental research is needed to test the study's underlying assumption of a link between constructs and first appraisal of cancer and to evaluate the nursing interventions that could be used to help women with breast cancer.

T1  - The structure and content of organizational identity in hypercompetitive environments
AN  - 304164476
AB  - This research explored the structure and content of the organizational identity--members' beliefs about central, distinctive, and enduring organizational attributes--for a high performing organization operating in a rapidly and discontinuously changing hypercompetitive environment. The study compared the dimensions of organizational attributes provided by members for similarities and differences across subunits and the organization as a whole. Analyses examined the extent to which organizational identity attributes are shared, and assessed the potential existence of distinct, coherent subidentities across geographic locations, business units, and organizational levels. The study also examined a new theory of organizational identity structure and content. This theory posits that intangible aspects of organizational identity will be more central than substantive elements in high performing organizations. As a first step in validating this theory, the study examined whether organizational identity dimensions for a hypercompetitive organization can validly be classified into intangible and substantive categories.    A sample of Intel Corporation employees completed an instrument based on a method that originated in cognitive psychology, the repertory grid technique. This method allowed organization members to identify dimensions of organizational attributes of Intel without the imposition of the researcher's frame of reference. This technique provided insights into the cognitive frameworks members hold regarding their high performance organization in a hypercompetitive environment.    The study found that organization members do share organizational identity attributes, although the number of widely shared attributes is small. Additionally, when members rated various organizational identity components along self-supplied dimensions, they made significant distinctions between current and ideal organizational identity. Evidence also was discovered supporting the existence of distinct subidentities by location, business unit, and organizational level. Preliminary support was obtained for the classification of identity attributes as either intangible or substantive.    The major theoretical contributions of this research are the verification of shared organizational identity attributes, the documentation of distinct organizational subidentities, and a theory of two types of organizational identity attributes for hypercompetitive organizations was proposed and tested. This study's primary methodological contribution is the application of a promising methodology for the study of organizational identity.

T1  - Change in self construction during the transition from university to employment: A personal construct psychology approach
AN  - 199362776; 00952199
AB  - A personal construct psychology framework and repertory grids were used in a longitudinal study designed to analyze the qualitative and evaluative nature of change in graduates' self-construction during the 6 months following organizational entry.  In line with the hypotheses guiding the research, the results suggest that graduates undertook some important qualitative change in self-construction but that these trends of change reflected individual developmental paths rather than a common socialization effect; change took place through both the development of new core role constructs, and change in self-ratings on stable constructs (slot change).  The study provides some modest support for the hypothesis concerning the positive relationship between self-esteem and role meaningfulness.  However, the initial level of self-esteem does not appear to moderate the effect of low role meaningfulness on subsequent  level of self-esteem, a finding that fails to support the hypothesis.

T1  - Understanding customers' views: An example of the use of repertory grid technique: MRN
AN  - 223524091; 00991231
AB  - Repertory grid testing was used as part of a marketing research project.  The goal of the investigation was to use interviews to identify how customers perceive product support for high-technology products (using the medical equipment market as a test case).  Product support is the name given in industry to the various forms of assistance that companies provide to customers to help them obtain maximum value from high-technology products.  Several key points emerged from the interviews: 1.  Interviews need careful design and piloting, to ensure that they achieve the research goals and fit with the boundary conditions of the sample and market under investigation.  2.  The repertory grid method can be used to help subjects articulate their views on a complex topic, in a situation where direct questioning is liable to cause interviewer bias.  3.  The repertory grid method  produces clear descriptions on constructs - so that they are unequivocal.

AN  - 231359962; 00821816
AB  - Following a critique of existing algorithms, an algorithm is presented which will reorganize a 2-way data table to bring like rows together, and like columns together.  Extensions of the method are described, and justified, to accommodate distances measured in modular arithmetic, and with bipolar columns/rows, as in repertory grid analysis.  One value of the algorithms is that the user can see relationships in the tables without the data in the cells themselves ever having been transformed.  Thus, users will continue to feel they own their data.

AB  - Quality initiatives need to be translated into actions by employees.  The importance of eliciting the knowledge and beliefs that employees use to guide their decisions at work is highlighted, and it is argued that everyday discourse (for example, conversation and group discussion) is an inadequate basis from which to unearth this information.  A variety of psychological techniques that can be used to help people "get at" their own views are outlined.  A study is reported that used situational interviewing and the repertory grid technique to elicit the models that food servers in the hospitality industry have of internal systems and procedures.  The "maps" that food servers have of service situations and colleagues reveal areas for quality improvement.

T1  - Gender, diversity and working styles
AN  - 213150619; 00848971
AB  - Evidence from a research study into the impact of gender on management styles is presented using repertory grid as a methodology.  Generalized differences were identified in the approaches of women and men to definition of the job, overall style, decision making, and interpersonal relationships.  Men had greater visibility to other men, while a broader insight was offered by women interviewees into the women managers' approaches.  In the context of patriarchal power relations, in which masculinity is defined as opposite and superior to femininity, feminine working styles are perceived as less effective in organizations, while masculine attributes tend to be regarded as normatively the way to manage.  Such values can imbue recruitment, selection, and development practices with gender bias.  Recent management and leadership theory has advocated the value of a people-centered approach, which traditionally and stereotypically has been associated with women.  There is a need to be alert to a redefinition of patriarchal relations as men seek to maintain status.

AB  - Although the literature on managerial decision making typically espouses rationality, this rarely occurs.  Managers form a personal and simplified model of the real situation, incorporating personal and environmental factors, to facilitate their decision making.  A study used a repertory grid to explore the decision making model of 16 National Health Service managers and investigate what factors were important to them when considering strategic decisions.  Results indicated the complex and idiosyncratic nature of managerial decision making, vindicating the view that to understand decision making in any detail requires knowledge of the individual's model.  Rationality did not emerge as the driving force underlying the managers' decision making behavior.  For many managers, emotional items seemed to exert a significant influence on their decision making.  A link between patterns of construing and stress was hypothesized.  Managers whose construing was simpler, contained contradictions, or was more emotional in content reported experiencing more stress.

AB  - Abstract. The selection and evaluation of road schemes through the Leitch framework is based on a combination of cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment. Both techniques involve the definition and valuation of a number of costs and benefits. These costs and benefits are defined and valued in isolation to each other so that we Imow virtually nothing about the relative valuation that people assign to different types of costs and benefits which might affect them directly or indirectly. This paper outlines the development of a method which allows people to conceptualise the costs and benefits of a road scheme in their own terms and then to rank schemes in relation to those costs and benefits. This method is based upon an interview process involving the use of repertory grid technique. The information from the repertory grid technique is used as a sound basis for determining trade-offs between attributes and for attempting to obtain monetary valuations of different project attributes. A number of exploratory interviews are reported which outline some of the difficulties with a number of the survey features including the choice of case-study, interviewer and information biases and sample and non-response biases. Various ways of dealing with these difficulties are discussed.

T1  - The Role of Fragrances in Product Development: Turning Images into Fragrances
AN  - 196319738; 00628116
AB  - The sensory properties of products are particularly important in the area of fine fragrances.  In an investigation, 10 assessors discussed some 19 fragrances, 19 essential oils, and 8 relevant chemical stimuli over a number of sessions.  Using group discussion, repertory grid, direct mapping, and simple profiling approaches, the assessors derived a list of 14 defined descriptors.  Fragrance descriptions and characteristics were grouped and reduced to a list which was used to obtain consumer reactions to actual fragrances assessed blind.  Under controlled evaluation conditions, 23 consumers tested 16 fragrances.  The sensory analysis and the subsequent linking of this to the image data showed that fragrant formulations can be identified in a consistent way using trained assessors and that this descriptive information can give good guidance to the product developer about what type of fragrance will suit a particular market position or the tastes of a particular consumer segment.

T1  - Cognitive Mapping and Repertory Grids for Qualitative Survey Research: Some Comparative Observations
AN  - 194219945; 00626878
AB  - A study of business strategy was carried out in 86 organizations in the crop protection industry.  A multi-operational approach was used to enable validation of data by triangulation.  This provided an opportunity to conduct a comparative evaluation of interactional investigative methods in a relatively controlled manner.  Some conclusions of the analysis are: 1.  Cognitive mapping satisfies many more process criteria than repertory grids.  2.  The data that cognitive maps produce are less comparable than the data from repertory grids.  3.  Splitting maps produced under the constraints introduced for the purposes of the project (actual versus ideal states) allows the respondent to focus on specific aspects of the ideal state one at a time and in contrast to the actual.  4.  Cognitive maps-as-programs possibly do not represent the cognitive structure of the client's own problem conception.  5.  Skeleton entries to cognitive maps (COPE) can be preferable to full-string entry for certain purposes, such as the analysis of large survey data.

T1  - Validating an Expert Support System for Tender Enquiry Evaluation: A Case Study
AN  - 231388133; 00610102
AB  - The Tender Enquiry Evaluation System (TEES) was developed as a support tool for a large electromechanical engineering company.  The system was developed to assist in tender enquiry evaluation and the bid versus no bid decision.  It was developed using repertory grid techniques based on the expertise of 2 senior managers.  The importance of the system's validation is stressed, and an appropriate formal validation framework is developed.  The results from the validation study suggest that the system provides an appropriate model of the organization's consensual business perspective regarding the bid versus no bid decision.  Furthermore, the study drew attention to some dissenting views among the organization's senior management that the managers believed to be helpful in clarifying their understanding of the issues affecting the bid versus no bid decision.

T1  - Validation of the Repertory Grid for Use in Modeling Knowledge
AN  - 231382313; 00603508
AB  - The extrapolation of theories of cognitive modeling from the psychological contexts to the domain of information systems design has raised empirical questions regarding the validity and reliability of these techniques in the new applications environment.  Kelly's (1955) theory of personal construct psychology (PCP) is one such theory that, together with the repertory grid technique of cognitive modeling, is being explored for use in systems development.  Since the repertory grid constitutes a mechanism for both the elicitation and the representation of cognitive models, it has been suggested for incorporation into intelligent front-end interfaces for information storage and retrieval systems (ISRS).  Previous applications of the grid have emphasized the personal and ideographic characteristics of personal construct systems.  The repertory grid is tested for representing commonality of construing among members of a homogeneous group of subjects.  Some differences are noted between constructs generated by subjects and those provided for them by an expert.  Implications of this effect for the application of PCP to ISRS design are discussed.

AB  - The extrapolation of theories of cognitive modeling from psychological contexts to the domain of informa tion systems design has raised empirical questions re garding the validity and reliability of these techniques In the new applications environment. Kelly's (1955) theory of personal construct psychology (PCP) is one such theory which, together with the repertory grid technique of cognitive modeling, is being explored for use in sys tems development. Since the repertory grid constitutes a mechanism for both the elicitation and the representa tion of cognitive models, it has been suggested for incorporation into intelligent front-end interfaces for in formation storage and retrieval systems (ISRS). Previ ous applications of the grid have emphasized the personal and ideographic characteristics of personal construct systems. New applications in information sys tems design require verification of the grid's utility and reliability for rendering faithful representations of im personal and communal knowledge. The research pre sented here provides a test of the repertory grid for representing commonality of construing among mem bers of a homogenous group of subjects. Commonality of construing is demonstrated on two sets of constructs. Some differences are observed between constructs generated by the subjects and those provided for them by an "expert." Implications of this effect for the appli cation of PCP to ISRS design are discussed.

T1  - Developing an Expert Support System for Tender Enquiry Evaluation: A Case Study
AN  - 204125984; 00614855
AB  - Assessing customers' tender inquiries to decide whether to bid or not is important for companies where the cost of tendering is high.  In the case considered, the expertise of 2 managers involved in assessing inquiries was developed into an expert support system.  Knowledge was elicited from these managers by asking them to consider previous tenders and specify the factors used in discriminating between them.  Their responses were rerpresented in repertory grids.  Analyses of these grids led to maps that show the hierarchical nature of the relationships between the key factors used by the managers.  The resulting expert support system improved the consistency of the inquiry review group, revealed unexpected aspects of the managers' reasoning and was generally welcomed by the company.

T1  - Towards a Model of Set Adviser Effectiveness
AN  - 215400897; 00605970
AB  - A model of effective set advising is researched from a literature review and repertory grid interviews with set advisers and is then tested against experience.  The 4 key dimensions that need to be managed to be able to deal effectively with a set are: 1.  the content dimension, which requires interpersonal skills and project diagnosis, planning, and management, 2.  the process dimension, by which the set adviser communicates and transfers action learning, the nature of team and group dynamics, and the basic group processes, 3.  the human feelings dimension, including how feelings are dealt with, put into a frame of reference, revealed, and acted upon, and 4.  the administration dimension, which involves ensuring that the logistics are in place.  Total contingency theories are challenged.  Behavioral and conceptual tools are developed by which advisers can be coached and developed over the dynamic life cycle of the set.

T1  - On Elephants and Blind Researchers: Methods for Accessing Culture in Organisations
AN  - 1698138491
AB  - This research compares two pre-existing methodologies for accessing culture, repertory grids and focused group discussions, with a modified version of the Twenty Statements Test (Kuhn and McPartland, 1954), a method originally developed to measure self concept. The comparison is made on the basis of three criteria: the levels and elements of culture accessed by the different methods; the amount and usefulness of the information gathered; and finally, the ease of use of the methods. The comparison of the methods is based on information gathered from 158 participants in a major UK company and the results clearly suggest that the modified Twenty Statements Test has most potential as a method for accessing culture in organisation. The results also suggest that the conceptualisation of aspects of culture needs to be clearer and more focused if progress in understanding about the content and consequences of culture is to be made.

T1  - Management Consultancy: Dimensions of Client-Consultancy Relationships
AN  - 1698137239
AB  - Although a great deal of management consultancy has been carried out in a wide variety of settings, very little research has been conducted examining underlying dimensions of the client-consultant relationship. The present study examines consultant and client perceptions of the consulting relationship. A procedure based on repertory grid technique was employed to elicit dimensions of client consultant relationships from 22 management consultants and 16 of their clients within a major UK company. A questionnaire was then developed in order to determine the importance and frequency of these dimensions to participants, and also to highlight the differences between the views of clients and consultants. Dimensions were found to fall within four broad categories: those relating to the client; those relating to the consultant; dimensions associated with contract details; and dimensions focused on relationship building. While both clients and consulting relationships, they differed in emphasis they placed on the different categories. More specifically, consultants viewed dimensions relating to relationship building as most important, while clients placed greater emphasis on dimensions associated with contract details. Recommendations, based on these findings are made for monitoring and enhancing client-consultant relationships.

T1  - Construing of self and others at work in the early years of corporate careers: Summary
AN  - 228760975
AB  - Research has examined personal change and stability in early adulthood but generally with standardized scales and without inviting explicit comparison of self with other people. The present work uses the repertory grid method to examine how graduates construe themselves and others during early career. Ninety-four graduate entrants to a multinational corporation with zero to four years' tenure completed repertory grids on two occasions one year apart. Results shed much light on the graduates' concepts of self relative to others in their work setting, and how these change over time. The graduates generally had fairly positive self concepts, though these did not become more positive with tenure. Most saw themselves much as they thought others saw them. Change in concepts of self varied greatly between graduates, as did the constructs on which those concepts were described. The results cast further doubt on whether organizational socialization affects people in uniform ways.

T1  - Etude préliminaire de l'abus sexuel précoce
AN  - 1969736706
AB  - The long term effects of sexual abuse are often measured by measuring behaviours such as social adjustment, job stability and marriage. This study was conducted to add to these internal measures. Using a semi-prospective instrument adapted from G. Kelly's repertory grid, the adolescents' perceptions of themselves and significant others are measured. Three hundred and twelve female adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19 (average age = 16) participated in the study; 79 presented with non sexual behaviour disorders (delinquency, stealing, etc.), 56 presented with serious sexual behaviour disorders (prostitution, persistant sexual promiscuity) and 177 presented with no problems requiring psychosocial intervention. Various analyses (descriptive, multiple variance, regression analysis) showed that sexual abuse significantly affects many of the adolescents' perceptions. Sexually abused adolescents perceived their two real parents as less competent and their ideal mother and father as less protective than adolescents who had not been abused. In contrast, their perception of self and the ideal self was not affected by the sexual abuse, a finding which will spark discussion.

T1  - A Question of Competency
AN  - 202753174; 00504121
AB  - Managers are now being encouraged to list the competencies that any employee in the organization needs to operate successfully.  The competencies are then used in selection, promotion, appraisal, counseling, and vocational guidance.  Lists of competencies come from autocratic chief executives and directors who go through focused interviews.  The lists also are acquired by group discussions, repertory grids, analysis, or adapting someone else's list.  Organizations devise ways of measuring the competencies so that applicants and employees can be compared and contrasted.  While there is a wealth of theories and studies attempting to specify the basic traits and abilities that are common to employees in a particular business, the question of what precisely competencies are remains unanswered.  A list of competencies is just that - a list, but human abilities are clearly related.  After deciding on its competency profile, an organization should investigate the structure of the competencies.

T1  - Repertory Grid Technique in Employee Selection
AN  - 214808582; 00509200
AB  - The repertory grid technique (RGT) is a psychological technique capable of elucidating the person-job match and the job-person match in employee selection.  The grid basically is a sorting exercise designed to elicit the dimensions, criteria, or constructs underlying an individual's rationale for all sorting decisions made.  Although essentially different, the task reactions repertory grid and the interview perceptions repertory grid hint at 2 inherent advantages - flexibility of design and face validity to participants.  Despite potential disadvantages with grids, the RGT and the underlying theoretical stance of personal construct psychology have much potential as an alternative and complementary strategy in employee selection.  When considering uses of the grid where the recruiter is acting as a participant, 3 interrelated applications arise: 1.  interviewer training, 2.  interviewer selection, and 3.  the identification of candidate assessment criteria.  A 2nd set of grid applications involves the applicant as the participant and follows from the contention that the RGT could be used to examine the job-person match.

T1  - Intuition in Venture Capital Decisions: An Exploratory Study Using a New Technique
AN  - 195844086; 00497375; 00270535
AB  - An exploratory study used the repertory grid technique, drawn from personal construct psychology, to develop an understanding of intuition.  In-depth interviews with 5 venture capitalists were conducted to obtain information about the particular constructs each uses in thinking about investment proposals.  The goal was to obtain systematic data on the content and structure of intuitions prior to the development of a questionnaire to be issued to a larger sample.  The results indicated that investment constructs can be grouped into 3 areas: management, unique opportunity, and appropriate return.  A cluster analysis showed that each venture capitalist had his own way of structuring the intuitions involved in the investment decision.  The results suggested that individuals seeking venture capital may need to adjust their approach to different venture capitalists in view of the diversity involved.

T1  - Knowledge Bases: Integration, Verification, and Partitioning
AN  - 204166494; 00466628
AB  - A literature review is presented of 3 aspects of knowledge base design: 1.  knowledge integration, 2.  knowledge verification, and 3.  knowledge-base partitioning.  The key approaches to combining multiple expertise include: 1.  metaknowledge, 2.  set theoretic, 3.  consensus theory, 4.  repertory grid analysis, 5.  cluster analysis, and 6.  decision theory.  Combining expertise improves poor individual performance but degrades good individual performance.  This means that it is preferable to construct expert systems using consensus when the domain knowledge does not exists in a state of high conflict.  Verification techniques include: 1.  knowledge acquisition-based verification, 2.  graph-based verification, 3.  confidence-value verification, and 4.  iterative verification.  Most verification techniques can be classified as either consistency checkers or completeness checkers.  Information-theoretic approaches and cluster analysis approaches are among the knowlege-base partitioning methods.

T1  - The Brightest and the Best: Factors Influencing the Retention or Withdrawal of Completing Teachers
AN  - 1979058489
AB  - Allegations that the most able simply intend to leave teaching were challenged by qualitative and quantitative data collected from 147 prospective teachers completing their credentialling diploma. A conceptual framework combining personal construct and social learning theories modelled the influences of personal, academic and social factors on intended persistence. A single line version of the repertory grid elicited reasons for intended persistence or withdrawal which were coded into 11 categories supported by the literature. A multiple classification analysis showed that those who were confident of promotion and who were committed to and satisfied by teaching intended persisting. While the findings were less clear for psychological constructs and for academic and social integration, some of the best prospective teachers intended staying for at least five years. The course itself was well received.

T1  - Important Dimensions of Strategic Issues: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
AN  - 194221024; 00465955
AB  - Decision makers must use dimensions to sort the wheat from the chaff in the field of potential strategic issues.  The dimensions implied by 3 literatures and dimensions generated by an empirical study are compared.  A search of the 3 literatures identified 26 dimensions that differentiate strategic issues.  Repertory grid techniques were used to identify the range of attributes used to define the "meaning space" for strategic issues in a sample of strategic decision makers at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  Dimensions in the literature overlap those in the empirical study; 13 dimensions accounted for 51% of the frequency with which all attributes were mentioned over all respondents.  However, these 13 dimensions exclude the one cited most often in the literature - immediacy.  Also, marked differences in the relative importance of classes of dimensions emerged in the sample relative to the literature.  Issue content was about 3 times as prevalent in the sample, action was about the same in both, analytic characteristics were almost twice as prevalent in the literature, and source did not emerge in the sample at all.

T1  - Construing the Business Portfolio: A Cognitive Model of Diversification
AN  - 194219336; 00465957
AB  - Researchers investigating the relationship between diversification and performance have been generally inattentive to the dominant general management logics that corporate-level managers use to understand and manage strategy diversity.  In response to this, the use of the repertory grid is proposed.  The grid is a methodology adapted from the work of Kelly (1955) and other personal construct theorists.  As an approach to operationalizing the mental maps that direct the management of strategic diversity, the business repertory grid appears to have several important advantages.  It is particularly useful in assessing the ways in which top managers construe the corporate portfolio and manage strategic diversity.  Grid technique is flexible, efficient, and systematic.  It is also highly reproducible, thus allowing researchers to validate or challenge the results of previous studies.  A main goal of the application of the repertory grid to the study of strategic diversity is to measure the way in which top managers perceive relationships among businesses in their firms.

T1  - Exploring the Meaning of Work and Nonwork
AN  - 224870755; 00450278
AB  - A study explored the relationship between work and nonwork activities for a group of employed professional and skilled tradespeople in New Zealand.  A preliminary sample of 40 subjects were used to to develop a 12-element repertory grid that was included in the questionnaires mailed to accountants, dentists, lawyers, primary school teachers, and plumbers.  Eighty-one usable responses were obtained.  The results confirmed previous research with the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic features of paid employment and the importance of a 3rd factor related to stress, time constraints, and the lack of free choice.  The results reaffirmed that job satisfaction is associated with the chance to use abilities and skills and with recognition for work well done.  More surprising was the clear distinction that these subjects made between the work and nonwork aspects of their lives and the perceived differences between their paid employment activities and nonwork activities, with little evidence of generalization between them.

T1  - Do Psychotherapists Use Different Construct Subsystems for Construing Clients and Acquaintances? A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 848882787
AB  - Forty-seven psychotherapists were studied to determine if they used different construct subsystems for construing clients and personal acquaintances. The sample included therapists who varied in terms of sex, age, years of experience, and clinical discipline. Subjects chose six personal acquaintances and six nonpsychotic individual therapy clients who were then used as elements in a Repertory Grid. Constructs were elicited by comparing pairs of elements; all elements were rated on the constructs. It was found that constructs elicited about one domain (clients or acquaintances) were less applicable to elements from the other domain. Therapists more often used constructs related to emotional stability when construing clients than acquaintances, whereas differences in construct content were not evident on several other dimensions. The domain of client construal exhibited greater cognitive differentiation and hierarchical organization than did that of acquaintance construal. The results suggest that therapists use different conceptual subsystems for client and acquaintance construal. Implications for the training of therapists are discussed.

AN  - 237018506; 00445702
AB  - Techniques are required to enable the user and analyst to work together in formulating and developing a model for the analysis of problems characterized by unclear statement of requirements.  Some techniques are described, and the rationale for their application to the process of information requirements analysis in the context of an experimental strategy is discussed.  In particular, the techniques described are delphi, game playing, operational experimentations, opinion questionnaires and surveys, pilot studies, prototyping, repertory grids, and system simulation.  Guidelines to support strategy formulation include considering: 1.  the purpose of the exercise, 2.  the underlying methodological approach, 3.  the particular strategy adopted, and 4.  the technique or mixture of techniques.  Analysis indicates there is a need to develop an experimental plan, a need to formulate strategy, and a need to understand the characteristics of the techniques.

T1  - Building Societies as Retail Banks: The Importance of Customer Service and Corporate Image
AN  - 231439820; 00449302; 00097163
AB  - UK building societies have successfully attracted funds in a deregulated environment; however, they have begun to lose some of their dominance in the mortgage market.  In a more competitive environment, building societies are diversifying and using more effective marketing techniques.  They have tended to distinguish themselves from competitors by emphasizing qualitative factors, such as friendliness and quality of service.  A survey on the topic of financial institutions was made of 30 individuals using Kelly's (1955) Repertory Grid technique.  It was found that building societies were perceived as distinct from banks in terms of traditional functions.  Building societies were generally considered more friendly, and banks were perceived as more efficient and businesslike.  Building societies have a competitive edge in terms of their favorable image, which they should emphasize in their attempts to develop stronger corporate identities.

T1  - A Repertory Grid Analysis of Austria's Image as a Summer Vacation Destination
AN  - 217447123; 00442413
AB  - The appropriateness of Kelly's (1955) repertory grid technique to destination image research is demonstrated.  Images held by UK vacationers of Austria as a summer destination were investigated.  A sample of 25 individuals matching middle-class and opinion-leadership characteristics were asked questions concerning recent vacations, future vacations, and countries to elicit names of countries.  Minimum context form (triadic method) was used to elicit constructs.  Respondents then located each country on a 5-point rating scale to match their image of the destination.  The respondents generated 296 constructs from 17 elements, and 3,062 ratings of 17 nations were obtained.  Content analysis reduced the constructs into 11 clusters.  In general, Austria was seen as an attractive destination for a summer vacation; 8 of the 25 participants rated it at the highest point.  The image data generated by the grid have the potential for more validity than those produced by structured questionnaires.

T1  - Construct System Organization and Schizophrenia: The Role of Construct Integration
AN  - 848853860
AB  - Personal construct psychology researchers frequently have linked a low degree of construct relatedness to schizophrenia. However, researchers also have found a low degree of construct relatedness to be predictive of accuracy in person perception tasks. Attempting to clarify this, Landfield (1977,1980) proposed that the schizophrenic's construing is characterized by both a low degree of construct integration and a low degree of construct relatedness. The role of both these variables was explored by administering repertory grids to 20 schizophrenic and 20 nonschizophrenic adult psychiatric inpatients. The linkage of schizophrenia to both a low degree of construct relatedness and a low degree of construct integration was supported. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Repertory Grid Methodology and the Analysis of Group Perceptions in Retailing
AN  - 198035495; 00433968
AB  - The use and potential of Repertory Grid Methodology and Personal Construct Theory (Kelly, 1955) in attitude measurement in retailing is investigated.  Researchers have been attracted to the Kelly theory because of its objectivity and the chance of obtaining a group viewpoint.  Case studies using the methodology include: 1.  students' shopping patterns (Hudson, 1974), 2.  shopping centers (Timmermans, Van Der Heijden, and Westerveld, 1982), 3.  comparison shopping -- shoes (Coshall, 1984, 1985), 4.  food shopping -- all store types (Opacic and Potter, 1985, 1986), and 5.  food superstores (Hallsworth, 1987).  The applicability of Kelly's technique was expanded by breaking away from a dependence on the assessment of the opinions of less than 100 persons.  The overriding advantage of the technique is its objectivity; it does not permit researchers to impose ideas on the subjects.  Constructs derived from retail applications of Kelly-type analysis are usually meaningful and easily understood by third parties, but the method can be very time-consuming.  This is reflected often in its sample sizes.

T1  - Beyond Focus Groups: A Thrift's Guide to Market Research
AN  - 204607160; 00369249; 00130408
AB  - Market research has become increasingly important for thrifts in today's competitive environment.  Market research helps assess the potential market for a proposed technology or define the factors that influence consumer behavior.  There are several research methods available to augment the traditional focus groups and telephone surveys.  For example, individual, in-depth interviews can overcome the problems of focus group research aimed at busy, affluent customers.  A more cost-effective alternative are Teledepth interviews, conducted by telephone, which can cover a wider and more diverse geographic area.  If the "group effect" is needed, a Telegroup can be used.  These are focus groups conducted by teleconferencing.  The Knowledge/Attitudes/Practices study combines quantitative and qualitative research to examine an individual's assumptions and behavior.  The Kelly Repertory Grid helps determine exactly which dimensions consumers use to evaluate and make purchasing decisions.  Finally, segmentation analysis can help thrifts target the subcategories in an overall financial market.

T1  - Cognitive Performance Appraisal -- Mapping Managers' Category Structures Using the Grid Technique
AN  - 214807150; 00377095
AB  - The repertory grid technique, a systematic method for eliciting the constructs that make up a person's cognitive structure, permits the mapping of a manager's frame of reference toward employee performance.  After selecting the elements to be used in obtaining managers' reference frames toward employee performance, the logical elements, i.e., the employees under the manager's supervision, are divided randomly into triads.  The manager is asked to show ways in which each combination of 2 employees varies from a 3rd.  This typically generates a construct mix related to personal traits of the employee and job performance.  The manager differentiates between triads until all personal constructs are exhausted and, by using a 5- or 7-point scale, rates the extent to which each employee is characterized by each construct.  Rating all elements in terms of all constructs produces a standard matrix or grid.  Several indexes can be constructed on the basis of the completed grid: 1.  frame differentiation, 2.  frame complexity, 3.  frame integration, 4.  construct centrality, and 5.  construct ranking.

T1  - Repertory Grid Combined with Learning Styles: A Pilot Study
AN  - 214112858; 00365817
AB  - The preferences of a learner are important to consider when attempting to make a learning event effective.  Honey and Mumford (1986) defined 4 basic learning styles: 1.  activists, 2.  reflectors, 3.  theorists, and 4.  pragmatists.  A research project, designed to investigate the learning style of individuals and to use the results to help in personal coaching and development sessions, used the Repertory Grid technique in combination with Honey and Mumford's Learning Style Questionnaire (LSQ).  The Repertory Grid is a method of understanding and structuring how people perceive things and make distinctions between various aspects of their environment.  During the study, each individual was given the Repertory Grid to complete, then asked to complete the LSQ.  The difference between each set of ratings was noted, as well as the ratings depicting "learned the most" and "learned the least." All the study's participants felt the results were indicative of their personal learning styles.

T1  - A Behavioural Analysis of Demand Elasticities
AN  - 220674107; 00344017
AB  - Based on ideas from personal construct psychology, it is proposed that people feel attached or strongly desire to become attached to specific consumption pathways because they assess that doing otherwise would entail implications of a predominately negative kind with respect to their abilities to understand the complex and uncertain world around them.  Information-processing problems may cause consumers to be unable to compute the overall implications of alternative strategies when market conditions alter.  Therefore, they may use simplifying decision methods that may conflict with the principle of substitution.  The research program of personal construct psychology includes a set of research techniques for revealing ways in which individuals view the world, and 3 of these techniques are: 1.  repertory grid, 2.  construct laddering, and 3.  Hinkle's (1965) implication grid.  These 3 tools show the implications to the consumer of choosing one of the action schemes over the others.

AB  - PA Consultants (London) has developed the criterion-referenced interview, which can provide structure to employment interviews because it is based on detailed analysis of the job.  Focal points of the analysis include: 1.  tasks associated with the job, 2.  personal characteristics, and 3.  the organization's culture.  Two approaches can assist supervisors in moving from general impressions to specific professional and personal qualities in their interviewing questions -- Kelley's Repertory Grid and Flanagan's Critical Incident.  A panel of supervisors and managers should use a list of observable behaviors to rank those behaviors according to: 1.  how important each is to reaching and maintaining a superior level of performance, and 2.  how frequently each one is required in a typical time period.  Having the job criteria clearly in mind is the key to using the criterion-referenced interview.

T1  - A Measure of the Integrative Complexity of Personal Constructs
AN  - 848853288
AB  - A repertory grid measure of the integrative complexity of personal constructs is described. The grid is proposed as a measure of a subject's use of comprehensive abstract constructs to integrate and direct the sampling of characteristics used in forming impressions of people. The grid method is based on principles described by Piaget as characterizing the stage of formal operations. At the stage of formal operations, the child uses abstract constructions of what is possible to direct the exploration of what is available to experience. The use of such abstract organizing constructs is referred to here as "integrative complexity." Grid scores of integrative complexity were found to match simulations of the progressive integration versus fragmentation of constructions. The grid scores were also found to correlate with Crockett's measure of level of organization in impression formation. The results support the credibility of the coordinate grid measure of integrative complexity

T1  - Using Repertory Grids for Problem Construction
AN  - 231252923; 00258966
AB  - Repertory grid theory (Kelly, 1955) was originally developed as a practical means of mapping an individual's perceptions of reality.  Recently, repertory grids have gained the attention of operations researchers as a tool for analyzing large, ill-defined decision problems.  Grid theory is discussed, and grid construction in application to a simple decision problem involving a single individual, along with the use of rating scales to measure preferences for decision alternatives, is demonstrated.  Application of grid theory and techniques is then extended to operations research problems, and alternative methods of problem construction, including cognitive mapping, are examined.  It is concluded that grids offer a coherent approach to problem construction in operations research, but are not necessarily preferable to other methods of problem analysis.

T1  - Portrayals of Teacher Development
AN  - 1979471370
AB  - The paper presents an ideographic research approach that is being developed to describe the career biographies of individual teachers. These 'portrayals' were seen as a means for exploring the notion of professional development and the personal and contextual conditions that bear upon it. Interviews, together with a variation on the repertory grid technique, were used with two experienced teachers as the means for constructing their phenomenological life-worlds. Implications for in-service education policies and strategies are drawn from the case studies, and a case is presented for the importance of developing models of teacher development complementary to models of curriculum innovation.

T1  - Management Team Development: A Problem-Centreed Technique
AN  - 215394562; 00250763
AB  - The problem-centered approach to management team development is preferable to packaged team building approaches that often make erroneous assumptions about problems to be solved.  The problem-centered method uses actual work problems and begins with an accurate diagnosis of problems and the development of strategies to resolve them.  Repertory grids and identity matrices are used to analyze similarities, differences, and group perceptions of relationships among team members.  Once problems are identified, problem-centered activity begins.  It includes: 1.  expression of the problems, 2.  sharing of perceptions of the problems, 3.  the consensus of the nature of the problems, 4.  the development of solutions, 5.  the allocation of responsibility for solutions, and 6.  agreement on follow-up stages.  The use of actual work problems facilitates the transference of learning to the workplace.  Case studies are given that indicate the success of this approach.

T1  - Sex Role Stereotypes, Gender Identity and Parental Relationships in Male Homosexuals and Heterosexuals
AN  - 204974710; SFLNSPJHX1299JHGW598000006
AB  - The sex-role stereotypes held by heterosexual and homosexual men were examined by comparing their Repertory Grid scores. It was found that homosexual men held less rigid sex-role stereotypes than heterosexuals. Degree of opposite-sex identification was marginally greater in homosexuals, but neither group showed strong masculine or feminine stereotypic identification. Homosexual men perceived themselves as psychologically more distant from their fathers than did their heterosexual counterparts; this was probably an effect of homosexuality rather than a cause.

T1  - An Algorithm for the Cluster Analysis of Repertory Grids in Human Resource Development
AN  - 214807914; 00196950
AB  - The Repertory Grid can be used as a descriptive technique for describing the construct systems of varied respondents across a range of applications.  An analysis of the basic grid and its variations in the area of personnel management and training demonstrated its strengths and weaknesses.  The primary advantage of grids is that they are a powerful way to describe individual cases, giving a detailed account of data from an individual employee.  The main disadvantage of grids is that they generate large amounts of idiosyncratic data that are less useful for statistical analysis.  One method of cluster analysis used in occupational settings is Focus.  In its original form as a computer program, Focus results in easily interpretable information from single grids; in its aggregated version, Sociogrid, Focus lends itself to the interpretation of sets of grids.  The cluster analysis is presented as an algorithm for computation by hand in a nonstatistical, straightforward format with some illustrative case material to suggest its applicability in personnel practice.

AN  - 211223582
AB  - A common problem of all cognitive-behavioural models of destination choice is that of the identification of factors influencing the behaviour of interest. This paper considers the applicability of Kelly's repertory grid methodology to identify the factors influencing consumer choice of shopping centres. Firstly, some methodological issues in the assessment of the relative importance people attach to certain variables in deciding where to shop are discussed. Secondly, the main findings of an application of the repertory grid methodology are presented. The paper concludes by discussing some implications of the measurement of the determinants of choice behaviour and the construction of mathematical models of destination choice.

T1  - Allocation of Repertory Grid Constructs to Superordinate Categories: Interjudge Reliability
AN  - 1970427613
AB  - After using a form of the Repertory Grid technique to elicit from teachers constructs of the characteristics of children with behaviour problems, the authors and four other judges allocated the constructs to superordinate categories.Some research reports have indicated that the criterion for interjudge reliability has been product moment correlations of the number of constructs allocated to categories. It is possible that such a method may lead to misinterpretation.Interjudge reliabilities, expressed by product moment correlations, were high when number of constructs was considered. However, an investigation carried out to ascertain percentages of same constructs allocated to the categories revealed that relatively low percentages of constructs were so allocated.

T1  - Toward a Cognitive Methodology of Organizational Assessment
AN  - 236285213; 00135729
AB  - An objective method for describing an organization in terms of its members' subjective, cognitive structures is presented.  The method is an adaptation of the Kelly Repertory Grid.  It produces a description of an organization's cognitive infrastructure.  Practitioners will find the method useful for most kinds of organizational research.  However, it is particularly suitable for the study of organizations with novel organizational structures: those composed of independent teams or other innovative forms of organizational structuring.  People's behavior in organizations is best understood in terms of their mental sets-conceptual frameworks-rather than in terms of needs or personality traits.  Major changes in cognitive structure are the result of a basic shift of constructs about natural phenomena.  Considering the infinite possibilities for cognitive structure, organizational assessment is more a matter of ideographic analysis than of measurement.  The study of organizations should be a study of perceptions as much as it is a study of observable social structure.

AN  - 227214073
AB  - One of the main methodological difficulties in carrying out research in the field of occupational stress is the use of pre-designed health and behavioural questionnaires. This has the serious disadvantage of either not including important stressors at work or distorting the importance of those that are included. This article describes the use of the Repertory Grid technique in identifying sources and manifestations of occupational stress which overcomes this obstacle. A detailed description of the Grid technique as it was applied to air traffic controllers is provided.

T1  - An Analysis of Three Managerial Jobs Using Repertory Grids
AN  - 194217234; 00124307
AB  - Accurate job analysis is the basis of industrial psychology, and it should provide the framework for decisions about: 1.  selection, 2.  training, 3.  job evaluation, and 4.  organization.  A repertory grid approach to job analysis is a technique that can be applied to the jobs of individual managers.  This technique enables a psychologist to produce a representation of an individual's ''mental model'' pictured as a mental map or dendrogram.  The subjects were 3 managers employed by a large chain of bakers in the north-west of England.  The repertory grid approach was used to define the 3 management jobs.  The results showed that the repertory grid analysis allowed for a more systematic and quantitative analysis, as it identifies: 1.  the most demanding tasks, 2.  the most important qualities, and 3.  the number and nature of any underlying trends.  The repertory grid analysis has the advantage of producing a pictorial representation of a job by plotting the position of each part of a job by using the loadings on the first 2 components as if they were references on a map.

Using the Repgrid as the basis for conducting an attitude survey is the most ambitious of its uses.  While the Repgrid is a survey, it is not a questionnaire.  Managers responding to the survey rate their peers on a numerical basis, according to common traits in handling people.  Then, strong points and weaknesses are listed, along with traits that make some different from others.Analyzing the results is more difficult and is the most crucial phase in the entire exercise.  A 7-step procedure facilitates analysis: 1.  Number the forms.  2.  Score the forms.  3.  Extract top data.  4.  Extract tail data.  5.  Sort and categorize data.  6.  Compare top and tail data.  7.  Produce summary pen pictures.Feeding back the results of the survey in a face-to-face meeting with management is preferred to a written report.  Participants may receive a written summary.  Total time spent should take around 36 hours.

T1  - The Study of Personnel Management as an Occupation, Using Repertory Grid
AN  - 214814717; 00101081
AB  - Part of a research project which examined personnel management as an occupational specialism is described.  The main intention is to understand personnel managers' values and beliefs and the settings which give rise to them.  This objective can be approached through the occupational community or the organizational context of personnel work.   This research draws on Kelly's personal construct theory by examining the way 20 personnel specialists in 4 organizations interpret and make meaningful the roles of others encountered in their working world.  These constructs were discovered by using a repertory grid technique, and results from the 4 organizations are compared.  Possible explanations are suggested of the ways in which the personnel specialists studied coped with values that conflict with their own and of how they are able to integrate within their organization's culture.  Results suggest that the way managers are subjected to competing pressures produces an adaptive response.

T1  - An Exploration of Occupational Role: An Exercise in Team Development
AN  - 214808375; 00093895
AB  - Personal Construct Theory (PCT), coupled with implications and repertory grids, was used to analyze the attitudes and perceptions a team of professional valuers in a British Local Authority held about their positions and functions.  The study sought to discover why officers with identical functions and similar qualifications and experience evaluated analogous situations and reached radically different conclusions.   Computer analysis of the grids used did point up constructs and elements with very little consensus among the officers.  The data provided were of little use to the officers themselves and required trained interpretation and application.  In the case study, a more effective and consistent team of professionals was formed when differences in personal constructs were pointed out to them.
