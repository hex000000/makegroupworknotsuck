T1  - Generations as social categories: An exploratory cognitive study of generational identity and generational stereotypes in a multigenerational workforce
AN  - 2220572973
AB  - Even though the academic press recognizes generational diversity and its consequences, the related findings are fractured, and research is incomplete regarding methodology and theoretical background. In adopting a social identity perspective concerning groups and self‐conception, we argue that the social identity perspective is in line with generational identity theory. Employing a cognitive mapping method (repertory grid technique, mixed methods), the present study taps into three generations (Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y) of Belgian managers' minds and demonstrates how they perceive their own and the two other generations. Our research reveals that perceptions of their own and other generations may direct social categorization and generational stereotypes of the in‐group and out‐group(s), that some of these stereotypes can be enacted, and that generational stereotypes do not necessarily coincide with age‐based stereotypes. Several metapatterns in the stereotypes are revealed as well. Hence, we contribute to the emerging field of research that calls for an identity‐based approach rather than a cohort‐based approach to generations and that validates the argument that generations as a workplace phenomenon must be considered a legitimate phenomenon. Insights into generations as social categories give a richer view of the interrelationships between generations in multigenerational situations at work.

T1  - Knowledge Creation in a Participatory Design Context: The use of Empathetic Participatory Design: EJKM EJKM
AN  - 2256096663
AB  - The growth and penetration of Internet across developing countries has led to availability of a plethora of ICT applications. Quite often, potential users of these applications hold varying perceptions, both negative and positive, in respect of potential usefulness. This in turn, results into variations in adoption outcomes. The extant literature posits that 80% of user perceptions are negative while only 20% of their perceptions towards available ICT application are positive. The negative perceptions inevitably results in low adoption or at times even non-adoption of applications, which then remain under or un-utilized. This paper reports on a participatory action research study, which explores how ICT application adoption may be enhanced through 'empathetic participatory design' as a method for creating knowledge that may have meaningful application utility. This is achieved through user behavioural simulation. The main mode of data collection and analysis was the repertory grid technique used to elicit constructs from simulated prototyped elements of a selection of applications. In this paper, the knowledge creation process involves the use of design scenarios and use-cases from the typical users' point of view during co-problem discovery and scoping in respect of problems identified by the user community. The findings of this paper reveal that a co-design approach results in reflective experiences, that create a hybridity of knowledge which is both tacit and explicit, reciprocating each other to enrich the design outcomes of the applications. We argue that knowledge is not only a belief of knowing and thinking but rather has the ability to be transformed into real action. The paper posits that tacit and explicit forms of knowledge are inextricably linked and that knowledge is created and expanded through social interaction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge using modes and methods of 'knowledge conversion'.

T1  - The perceived relationship between population growth and current ecological problems using repertory grid technique
AN  - 2291849060
AB  - Population growth (PG) is one of the main drivers of environmental deterioration. Understanding lay perception of PG is important for mobilizing public opinion and support for environmental protection.A range of real-life current ecological problems, including PG, was presented to a sample of a hundred Israeli students without environmental education. We employed George Kelly's repertory grid technique along with principal component analysis to: (a) examine risk perceptions about PG in relation to various ecological problems and (b) identify the perceived risk attributes that influence risk perception of PG.We found that: (a) PG severity was perceived as extremely modest, and that very few respondents viewed it as a catalyst of all other ecological problems that warranted prevention. (b) The most significant predictors of risk evaluation were the perceived certainty of the risk and the level of emotional response it evoked.PG emerges as an idiosyncratic type of risk that is as psychologically distant as possible from most other ecological problems. This reflects a profound lack of understanding of the long-term effects of PG and the underlying causes behind many of today's ecological problems. The importance of raising awareness about demographic factors in environmental degradation is discussed.

T1  - Self-Knowledge and Depressive Symptoms in Late Adolescence: A Study Using the Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 2193681711
AB  - The goal of this study is to explore the relationship, suggested by recent developmental approaches, between several aspects of self-knowledge organization and depressive symptomatology in late adolescence, within the comprehensive framework of Kelly's personal construct psychology. The repertory grid technique was used to obtain six measures of self-knowledge organization: global differentiation; polarization; presence of conflicts; and discrepancies between actual self, ideal self, and others. Two inventories were used to create two samples of late adolescents according to their level of depressive symptoms. Results supported the expectations of greater global differentiation and actual-ideal self discrepancy (or lower self-esteem) for adolescents with depressive symptoms, as well as a higher likelihood of intrapersonal conflicts. However, discrepancies between self (actual or ideal) and others (identification, and perceived adequacy of others), and polarization showed no significant differences. Furthermore, the association of symptom severity with different grid measures was stronger for adolescents with depressive symptoms. Results and limitations of this study are discussed, and the potential of using personal construct theory and the repertory grid technique in studies of self-knowledge and psychological adjustment during adolescence is explored.

T1  - Do young women with tattoos have lower self-esteem and body image than their peers without tattoos? A non-verbal repertory grid technique approach
AN  - 2171189729
AB  - Available evidence regarding the reasons for people to acquire body markers such as tattoos is contradictory. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between self-esteem and body image in young women with tattoos. To this end, the repertory grid technique (RGT) was adapted and used to assess differences between women with and without tattoos in terms of self-esteem and body image. Sixty young women with tattoos and sixty young women without (all aged 18–35 years), performed the Color RGT in order to evaluate the relationship between self-esteem and body image. Compared to women without tattoos, women with tattoos showed significantly lower self-esteem and displayed stronger relationships between three constructs: ideal body, ideal self and tattooed woman status. No significant differences in body image were detected between the two groups. Women with tattoos were characterized by an association between body image and self-esteem, while women without tattoos did not display such a correlation. Thus, it appears that links between self-esteem, ideal body, ideal self and constructs of "woman with tattoos" may play a role in tattooing behavior in young women.

T1  - Value in the Eyes of Users: A Case Study of Web-Based Applications Using Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 2132077449
AB  - Conference Title: 2018 International Conference on Promising Electronic Technologies (ICPET)
Conference Start Date: 2018, Oct. 3

Conference Location: Deir El-Balah, Palestine
A few years ago, users were solely end-consumers with very limited knowledge and role. While today they are a common element in the development of any product or service with a fruitful knowledge and active role. Identifying the values and needs of the user constitutes a crucial activity in the development process. However, values are still implicit and inexpressive. Models and techniques which incorporate user value in the development process are still missing so far. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to understand the values and activities that lead to its creation from the point of view of users. The Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) has been employed where (22) users have been interviewed to derive their values and activities in web-based applications. The results show that the values related to everyday life activities are the most important to the user while values related to the design of the web application come second in terms of importance. The results also show that the most important activities to the user are those activities for learning, networking and sharing. The findings indicate that there is a strong linkage between user value and the concept of user experience which require to be explored further and considered in any new development projects.

T1  - Triggering the internationalization of Malaysian quantity surveying firms
AN  - 1926285831
AB  - Although there is an increasing trend of services being traded across borders, quantity surveying (QS) firms in the construction sector remain under-researched. The triggers for the increasing globalization of QS firms are not clear, nor how these triggers are perceived by managers at different levels. A questionnaire was administered in over 84 QS consultancy firms, and the results were analyzed using the repertory grid technique, allowing a comparison between the general respondents and a focus group of senior managers. The findings show that senior managers with significant experience realize the importance of a strong internal capability of the QS firm and the capability to develop innovative offerings, coupled with an awareness of the target market and the ability to secure revenue through key contracts. Firm- and location-specific factors were more important than other competitive advantages or foreign markets' characteristics when deciding to globalize.

T1  - Applying the Repertory Grid Method for Technology Forecasting: Civil Unmanned Aviation Systems for Germany
AN  - 1953986902
AB  - Multistage expert surveys like the Delphi method are proven concepts for technology forecasting that enable the prediction of content-related and temporal development in fields of innovation (e.g., [1, 2]). Advantages of these qualitative multistage methods are a simple and easy to understand concept while still delivering valid results [3]. Nevertheless, the literature also points out certain disadvantages especially in large-scale technology forecasts in particularly abstract fields of innovation [4]. The proposed approach highlights the usefulness of the repertory grid method as an alternative for technology forecasting and as a first step for preference measurement. The basic approach from Baier and Kohler [5] is modified in-so-far that an online survey reduces the cognitive burden for the experts and simplifies the data collection process. Advantages over alternative approaches through its simple structure and through combining qualitative and quantitative methods are shown and an adaption on an actual field of innovation - civil drones in Germany - is done. The measurement of a common terminology for all experts minimizes misunderstandings during the interview and the achievement of an inter-individual comparable level of abstraction is forced by the laddering technique [6] during the interview.

T1  - Exploring teachers' meta-strategic knowledge of science argumentation teaching with the repertory grid technique
AN  - 1870652614
AB  - This study investigated two science teachers' meta-strategic knowledge (MSK) of argumentation teaching by applying the repertory grid technique (RGT). One teacher was a novice, while the other was experienced in teaching argumentation. Using the RGT, we elicited the objectives and strategies of the two teachers regarding their argumentation teaching involving two social scientific issue (SSI) scenarios. The results showed that the experienced teacher had more varied and organised MSK for teaching argumentation than the novice teacher. Meanwhile, the novice teacher indicated a belief that the learning of argumentation should occur in a more student-centred manner, rather than relying on a traditional lecture-based environment. Consequently, she spent a considerable amount of time engaging students with their peers' ideas through discussion and collaboration. On the other hand, the experienced teacher noticed that most of students had the ability to generate arguments, but that few knew how to argue based on evidence. Therefore, she helped students to collect data from various resources and suggested that they construct their own knowledge framework in order to improve students' ability to incorporate their understanding of scientific knowledge into scientific argumentation.

T1  - What is the function of a figurine? Can the repertory grid technique tell?
AN  - 1828125384
AB  - Teaching design and product development at upper secondary school level in Sweden is a matter of interdisciplinary considerations. Education in product development, at this level, prepares students for further studies and career in engineering or industrial design. Knowledge of artefacts is an important element in the education. In coherence with the visual and rhetorical strategies characterising the knowledge field, students learn how to develop an idea to a final product. In this study twelve engineers and industrial designers, professionals representing the knowledge field of product development are studied regarding their interpretations of eight pre-selected artefacts. Data is collected and analysed using repertory grid technique. The aim of the study is to examine whether/what we can learn from the informants' experiences and knowledge that is relevant to education in design and product development at upper secondary school level. Findings show that four of the artefacts appear to be carriers of attributes that reveal the interviewees' definitions of the artefacts' functional nature. From these findings it is shown that the interviewees' definitions of concepts concerning aesthetics/decoration and function can be seen as cultural expressions. How the repertory grid technique is used in this particular study is thoroughly described and the results relevance for education is discussed.

AB  - This qualitative study analyzes perceptions of online trust cues as identified by shoppers from three countries: Germany, Russia, and the USA. A novel approach of the repertory grid method is used to study online trust cues in business-to-consumers commercial online transactions. This study resulted in the list of web site elements and features that consumers recognize as trust cues and use to evaluate e-vendor's trustworthiness. Findings show that out of fourteen categories of online trust cues, identified by online shoppers, three categories of online trust cues are found to be common across three cultures while eleven categories are culture specific. This exploratory study was done in the natural environment but participants did not buy a product. They only examined web sites to evaluate perceived trustworthiness. Hence, one has to be cautious in drawing final conclusions and applying them from a sample to a general population

T1  - Investigating the Impact of Need Knowledge on Strategy Development in Organizations
AN  - 1860279521
AB  - Strategy development results from a knowledge-creating process to guide organizational behavior and achieve (long-term) goals. However, a strategy rarely considers the needs of the organization and its members explicitly. If known and considered, needs might have an existential impact on behavior. Therefore, we propose that a profound strategy should take into account needs. Arguably, the generation of any strategy can be considered as an organizational learning process, which is shaped by and results in knowledge. Therefore, a knowledge perspective might be helpful to study what impact the consideration of needs has on the outcome of a strategy development process. Since the concept of need knowledge has only been introduced recently to knowledge-based management, the impact of this type of knowledge has not been considered in strategy development processes. Our empirical research aims at understanding the differences between strategies, which emerge with regards to needs in the social system and strategies, which are developed without explicitly considering needs. Therefore, we conducted an experiment with two groups of students, who were encouraged in a collaborative learning task to design strategies for a better learning and teaching environment at their university. To evaluate these strategies, we used a repertory grid analysis to investigate how explicit need knowledge affects the outcome of the organizational learning process.

T1  - Using the Repertory Grid Technique to Examine Trainee Clinical Psychologists' Construal of Their Personal and Professional Development
AN  - 1826021327
AB  - The repertory grid technique was used to explore how 26 third-year trainee clinical psychologists construed their personal and professional selves over the course of training and into the future. Each trainee completed a demographic questionnaire and a repertory grid with 10 elements: four 'personal self' elements, four 'professional self' elements and two 'qualified clinical psychologist' elements. They then rated the 10 elements on 10 bipolar constructs of their choosing. Trainees' personal and professional selves were construed to be similar to each other. Trainees had low self-esteem and reported currently feeling anxious, stressed, unsettled and lacking an appropriate work-life balance. These difficulties were attributed to the demands of training and were expected to resolve once training was completed with future selves being construed as similar to ideal selves. Suggestions for future research with improved methodology are made, and the implications of the findings for trainees, training providers and employers of newly qualified clinical psychologists are given. The overall implication being that stress in training is normative and the profession has a duty to normalize this and ensure that self-care and personal development are recognized as core competencies of the clinical psychologist for the benefit of its members and their clients.

Key Practitioner Message

              
Clinical psychology trainees experience training as demanding and stressful, which negatively impacts on their personal and professional self-image and self-esteem.

              
However, they are optimistic that they will become more like their ideal self in the future.

              
Stress in clinical training (and beyond) is normative, and thus, personal development and self-care should be recognized as clinical psychologist's core competencies.

T1  - Authorised property appraisers’ perceptions of commercial property valuation
AN  - 2158240134
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the thought patterns of authorized property appraisers (APAs) when valuing commercial properties, and draw conclusions about their collective thinking in terms of content, complexity, and homogeneity. Design/methodology/approach – A standard set of value-adding factors and bipolar constructs was included in a grid form used for data collection. The repertory grid technique and principal component analysis were used to map and analyze the thought patterns of nearly half of the APAs in Sweden. Findings – Analysis of the mean grid for all respondents revealed three dimensions in the aggregated APA thought pattern: property object – property market focus, abstract – specific information, and expert – superficial assessments. The aggregated thought pattern was found to be moderately complex, and the APAs demonstrated relatively strong homogeneity in their thought patterns. Practical implications – Based on the moderate complexity and relatively strong homogeneity in respondent thought patterns, this study discusses the upcoming establishment of a profession. Originality/value – To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first study using the repertory grid technique to map and analyze APA thought patterns at an aggregated level.

T1  - Application of Kelly’s Repertory Grid Technique in Research on Science Education
TT  - 凱利方格法在科學教育研究的應用
AN  - 2287821443
AB  - This paper discusses the possible application of the repertory grid technique (RGT) in science education through a literature review. We first describe the common strategies for using RGT in psychology and education research. We then explore the reasons for using RGT and the relationship between the aforementioned strategies and the purposes of studies in the literature. Finally, we explain whether and how using RGT can assist researchers in deeply exploring science education. Three basic strategies for using RGT are summarized according to a literature review: eliciting elements and constructs, constructing the grid, and analyzing the grid. RGT enables researchers to construct and reconstruct the qualitative data on the basis of quantitative analysis, which supports exploring subjects’ cognitive systems and comparing subjects. In science education, studies have applied RGT for various purposes, which we categorized into three types: exploring individual cognitive systems, developing principles for teachers’ professional development, and evaluating the quality of textbooks. The limitations and validations of RGT are discussed in the final section of this paper.Alternate abstract: 本研究以文獻回顧的方法探索凱利方格法的原理與策略，再反思科學教育研究領域中可應用凱利方格法進行研究的契機與限制。凱利方格法的分析與探索主要包含下列階段：元素與構念的萃取; 方格的建構與評比，以及方格的分析與解釋。這些資料分析的過程對教育研究而言具備以下優勢。首先，研究者透過凱利方格法的應用，建立有系統的資料蒐集與彙整架構，發現資料中既存的脈絡。再者，凱利方格法除了能針對單一個案所反映的方格評比進行探索與分析外，也容許跨個案的比較。在科學教育相關研究中，這些優勢適合被應用於探索學生科學學習; 教師專業發展，以及評鑑科學課程與教科書等。本研究最後也說明在應用凱利方格法分析時須考量的信度與效度，以及相關的研究限制，以更明確地說明使用凱利方格法分析的策略。

T1  - School Administrator's Cognitive Constructs Related to Ideal Teacher Qualifications: A Phenomenological Analysis Based on Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 1830615600
AB  - In this study, it was aimed to reveal school administrators' cognitive constructs related to ideal teacher qualifications. For this purpose, the study was conducted based on phenomenological design which is one of the qualitative research patterns. The study was conducted on 24 school administrators working in 24 different schools in the Giresun and Ordu city centres during 2015-2016 academic year. Criterion sampling technique was used to determine the study group. Data were collected by using repertory grid technique. The school administrators have produced 240 valid cognitive constructs related to ideal teacher qualifications. The most frequently mentioned cognitive constructs are namely, (1) communication/communication skills [η=9, 3,8%], (2) close attention/closeness to students [η=8, 3,3%], (3) self-sacrificing [η=8, 3,3%], (4) self-improvement [η=8, 3,3%], (5) job enthusiasm [η=8, 3,3%], (6) planning [η=8, 3,3%], (7) openness to improvement [η=7, 2,9%], (8) collaboration [η=7, 2,9%], (9) work devotedly [η=7, 2,9%], and (10) responsibility [η=6, 2,5%]. The 240 cognitive constructs produced by school administrators related to ideal teachers' qualifications were collected in eight different groups considering functionality and the similarities.

T1  - Integrated charging infrastructure: cognitive interviews to identify preferences in charging options
AN  - 1721563411
AB  - Purpose

              
The aim of this paper is to provide insight into how people assess different charging options in the context of electric mobility and how charging can be integrated into daily activities. The central research question concerns the acceptance of fast charging with direct current up to 200 kWh relative to alternative charging concepts such as inductive charging or battery changes as a part of mobility routines.

              
Method

              
The Repertory Grid Technique uses cognitive interviews based on the Personal Construct Theory by George Kelly to motivate respondents to reflect electric mobility beyond the insights that regular interview forms can provide. 20 respondents from Berlin were asked about their subjective perceptions and emotions relating to electric mobility and to different charging options.

              
Results

              
Charging processes are accepted when they appear to proceed subconsciously. That is, options are accepted when they are not perceived to result in trip interruptions or delays. Fuelling a vehicle with an internal combustion engine is mostly not considered as a trip interruption, and provides a benchmark to which all other charging options are compared. We identify the need to integrate charging options into existing mobility patterns, and provide evidence arguing against the need for a comprehensive charging infrastructure from a users' perspective.

              
Conclusions

              
The Repertory Grid technique provides a valuable tool for the exploration of perceptions of public and private charging infrastructure. By overcoming difficulties in reaching an underlying reality that are inherent to standard interviews, this technique may be useful in creating a shift towards a more sustainable mobility.

T1  - The Improvement of Kansei Engineering by Using the Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 1861158661
AB  - A customer-oriented approach to product development with particular consideration of emotions is represented by Kansei Engineering. Developed by Mitsuo Nagamachi, Kansei Engineering is characterized by the possibility to capture customer perceptions and to translate them into product features. In order to assess these perceptions, a semantic space is generated. For this purpose it is necessary to identify Kansei words that are gathered up through research in marketing concepts, scientific journals and service reports. This procedure though displays the disadvantage of not being able to identify all emotions referring to the investigated product.

              
One way to improve the identification of Kansei words is Repertory Grid. The Repertory Grid technique makes it possible to gather unaltered perceptions through in-depth interviews from the direct interaction with customers. Thus, the interview phase of the Repertory Grid technique offers an improved approach to identify of Kansei words.

T1  - The use of the repertory grid technique in online trust research
AN  - 1690965328
AB  - Purpose              - This paper aims to explore online consumers' perceptions of a trustworthy Web site. Specifically, it analyzes which Web site elements and features online buyers identify as online trust cues signaling e-vendor's trustworthiness.              Design/methodology/approach              - This study implemented a repertory grid technique to gain insight into the customers' perceptions of Web site trustworthiness.              Findings              - The most frequently identified online trust cues belong to the "Layout", "Easy to Use" and "Sales" categories. This is in contrast with the traditional views that Web elements related to customers' privacy and security are leading trust cues. In addition, online shoppers confirmed two trends in e-commerce: the role of social media in developing online trust to e-vendors is increasing and online shopping is associated with entertainment.              Research limitations/implications              - Rich data collected from 16 participants of this qualitative study present a challenge for generalizability. A caution should be taken in extending findings to the whole population of online shoppers.              Practical implications              - This study proves that the repertory grid technique is a useful method for qualitative market research. This method helped to solicit a list of Web site elements and features that online consumers identified as online trust cues. As buyers refer to those cues when deciding to trust or not to trust an e-vendor with the private and confidential information, businesses could use these research findings in designing Web sites that signal trustworthiness to customers.              Originality/value              - This study contributes to the research methodology as it extends the use of the repertory grid technique to the study of online trust cues and collection of data online. It is one of a few qualitative studies of online trust cues.

T1  - The Repertory Grid Technique as a Method for Eliciting Tacit Knowledge
AN  - 1721001670
AB  - The Repertory Grid Technique is a particular knowledge elicitation method which has been shown to be useful in eliciting tacit knowledge, i.e. knowledge which is difficult to put into words. One of its uses in business and management has been as a tool for eliciting knowledge from Subject Matter Experts about their occupation. This paper will focus on the use of this method to understand how financial advisors understand and experience ethical and unethical behaviour in their profession. 20 structured interviews were carried out with financial advisors and analysed using this technique. Thematic analysis of the resulting data yielded 153 unique constructs organized into 23 categories and 4 superordinate categories, examples of which will be provided in this paper. This study contributes to the understanding of ethical behaviour in practice in a specific profession where unethical behaviour can have severe undesired consequences. Furthermore, its results can be used to design specific training programmes based on the in-depth understanding of the skills and qualities desired for ethical financial advisors. Other practical applications of the results could include the preparation of comprehensive job descriptions as aids in the recruitment process for financial professionals. This study will be used to illustrate the salient points of using Repertory Grid Technique in business research, and the rationale behind the decisions taken at each stage. The underlying theory behind this technique, namely Kelly's Personal Construct Theory, will be discussed, and its relevance to the understanding of the way individuals conceive the world around them will be presented. Finally, the strength of this research method as a possible integration of the idiographic and nomothetic paradigms, amenable to both qualitative and quantitative analysis, will be presented. In conclusion, possible applications of this research method to other business scenarios, and its relevance to evidence based practice, will be explored.

Maturity in software projects is often equated with data-driven predictability. However, data collection is expensive and measuring all variables that may correlate with project outcome is neither practical nor feasible. In contrast, a project engineer can identify a handful of factors that he or she believes influence the success of a project. The challenge is to quantify engineers' insights in a way that is useful for data analysis. In this exploratory study, we investigate the repertory grid technique for this purpose. The repertory grid technique is an interview-based procedure for eliciting "constructs" (e.g., Adhering to coding standards) that individuals believe influence a worldly phenomenon (e.g., What makes a high-quality software project) by comparing example elements from their past (e.g., Projects they have worked on). We investigate the relationship between objective metrics of project performance and repertory grid constructs elicited from eight software engineers. Our results show correlations between the engineers' subjective constructs and the objective project outcome measures. This suggests that repertory grids may be of benefit in developing models of project outcomes, particularly when project data is limited.

T1  - Methodology for Identifying Hidden Customer Needs in China's Automobile Market
AN  - 1780137882
AB  - A methodology for identifying and understanding better customer hidden needs as an input into the new product development process is presented. Specifically, a modified Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) approach is developed and implemented using an exploratory yet purposive sample of 27 customers of a global automotive brand in China. The method, in a cognitive way, shows how customers perceive products by information from personal elements, personal constructs and ratings. The research, accordingly, has designed an integrated approach that facilitates access to customers' cognitions and perceptions. The method therefore enables market researchers and new product developers to identify and evaluate better important innovative product attributes and ultimately examine their influences on customer satisfaction. The analytical method not only helps identify the most significant hidden needs, but also provides a framework for the categorization of attributes for effective product development.

T1  - How Authorized Property Appraisers Construe Information For Valuation Of Commercial Properties: A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 1767756094
AB  - Purpose - This study describe and analyze authorized property appraisersÃ* (APAs) thought patterns when commercial properties are valued, and compare and draw conclusions about their thinking in terms of content, complexity and homogeneity. Design/methodology/approach - First, a standard set of elements and constructs was included in the grid form (used for data collection). Second, the repertory grid technique and principal component analysis were used to map and analyze the thought patterns of nearly half (67) of the authorized APAs in Sweden. Findings - Analysis of the individual grids and the mean grid of all respondents demonstrated similarities in the APAs construing and revealed relatively homogeneous thought patterns. Accordingly, the APAs seem encouraged by general guidelines (such as Swedish Annual property Index valuation guidance), and by guidelines and ethical rules prepared by the APAs own organization. At the same time the APAs thought patterns were found to be relatively complex. They focus on several kinds of information and their assessments are perceived to effect property valuation on micro and macro levels differently. Practical implications - Based on the homogeneity in the APAÃ*s thought patterns, this study discusses if authorized APAs have begun a Ã'legitimacy journeyÃ" towards an upcoming establishment of a profession. Originality/value Ã - To the auditors knowledge this is the first study using the repertory grid to map and analyse APAÃ*s thought patterns at an aggregated level. Keywords - Authorized property appraisers, Valuation judgments, Commercial properties, Profession, Thought patterns, Aggregated level, Repertory grid technique, Sweden Paper type Research Paper

T1  - Impact of community pharmacist intervention discussing patients' beliefs to improve medication adherence
AN  - 1586090078; 25135805
AB  - Background Adherence to evidence based medicines in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction remains low. Individual's beliefs towards their medicines are a strong predictor of adherence and may influence other factors that impact on adherence. Objective To investigate if community pharmacists discussing patients' beliefs about their medicines improved medication adherence at 12 months post myocardial infarction. Setting This study included 200 patients discharged from a public teaching hospital in Queensland, Australia, following a myocardial infarction. Patients were randomised into intervention (n = 100) and control groups (n = 100) and followed for 12 months. Method All patients were interviewed between 5 to 6 weeks, at 6 and 12 months post discharge by the researcher using the repertory grid technique. This technique was used to elicit the patient's individualised beliefs about their medicines for their myocardial infarction. In the intervention group, patients' beliefs about their medicines were communicated by the researcher to their community pharmacist. The pharmacist used this information to tailor their discussion with the patient about their medication beliefs at designated time points (3 and 6 months post discharge). The control group was provided with usual care. Main outcome measure The difference in non-adherence measured using a medication possession ratio between the intervention and control groups at 12 months post myocardial infarction. Results There were 137 patients remaining in the study (intervention group n = 72, control group n = 65) at 12 months. In the intervention group 29 % (n = 20) of patients were non-adherent compared to 25 % (n = 16) of patients in control group. Conclusion Discussing patients' beliefs about their medicines for their myocardial infarction did not improve medication adherence. Further research on patients beliefs should focus on targeting non-adherent patients whose reasons for their non-adherence is driven by their medication beliefs.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Repertory Grid Technique as a Customer Insight Method
AN  - 1563753068
AB  - The success of new products and services relies on meeting customer needs, but it is very difficult to identify hidden needs since customers have difficulty articulating them or do not recognize them at all. A number of methods have been applied to help identify hidden needs, including ethnography, empathic design, and lead-user innovation. In this paper, we discuss the use of the repertory grid technique (RGT), a method adopted from psychology that has been used in new product development to help uncover customers' hidden needs. Three case studies from our own work show that it can be applied effectively at different stages of the product development process, resulting in entirely new products, product improvements, and new approaches to marketing.

T1  - A first step towards engineer-oriented adaption of the Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 1546547294
AB  - Different approaches and methods exist to determine product perceptions from the perspective of the customer. These are more or less suitable to provide specific product requirements for product development. Specifically in the area of quality perception, it is difficult to determine target-oriented and product-improvement requirements. One possible approach is the Repertory Grid Technique, which originates from psychology and was developed in 1955 by George A. Kelly. Today, it is applied in market research and provides important suggestions for determining the perception and positioning of products. Equally, initial studies have shown the applicability of the Repertory Grid Technique in the area of quality management. The results are sometimes difficult to interpret, and only provide limited constructive information to support product development. In this paper, various Repertory Grid studies are presented and compared with regard to the quality of their results. Through feedback loops, the technique is gradually modified and improved based on the quality of their results.

T1  - The Development of Government to Citizens e-Service Design Process: Feature Identification Using Repertory Grid
AN  - 1546004948
AB  - e-Government services are typically developed by internal service providers, often neglecting the service end user. To address this issue we are exploring the use of co-design and focus on Jordanian Government to Citizens (G2C) e-services. We examined the appropriateness of applying the Repertory Grid (RepGrid) technique in understanding the key cognitive elements of the design process. We show that when used with representative participants, it allows a sufficient flexibility for the research participants to be able to express their own interpretation about a particular topic. Thus, we used this technique to guide our interviews with 19 participants from 3 groups - government staff (service providers), Citizens workers (government entities/service interface), and typical citizens (service users). RepGrid provides structure to a 'one-to-one' interview. Comprehensive lists of requirements were uncovered quantitatively using frequency and average normalised variability (ANV) and qualitatively using the open coding method in the manner of grounded theory. Thirty-nine unique requirements were identified and classified into five categories: Service initiating and scoping, service planning and analysing, service development and deployment, service evaluation and updating, and service usability. The study provides a context-specific evaluation of important requirements that support multiple stakeholders during the design process. The results of this study provide results which have significant implications for service providers, service users, and the service interface (linking service providers and users). In addition to its data gathering potential, RepGrid proved to be a suitable research technique for gathering and analysing qualitative and quantitative data.

T1  - What Drivers Really Want: Investigating Dimensions in Automobile User Needs
AN  - 1524724049
AB  - Understanding what users need, as opposed to what they say they need, can be a challenge. In order to better address users' true needs, two consecutive methods were used in this study: Future Workshops and Repertory Grid Technique. The Future Workshops--where 21 participants designed for two different future scenarios--opened up for inscribing need expressions and possibilities into five futuristic automobile concepts. These concepts were used as a basis for the Repertory Grid, a technique where users compare objects, describing properties that they find to be important or significant. In this study, 78 participants provided 390 constructs of properties, which were refined to 19 dimensions relevant to user needs. Two study measures, Evaluative Ability and Descriptive Richness, indicate which methods to use when exploring the need dimensions further. Finally, the analysis of the constructs and dimensions point towards how three aspects of vehicles and driving are emerging: how novel technology should, or should not, support driving; how the automobile can be seen as something else than just a means of transportation, and how an automobile could be a part of a greater collective of vehicles.

T1  - Evaluating Constructive Alignment Theory Implementation in a Power Systems Analysis Course Through Repertory Grids
AN  - 1447765853
AB  - <?Pub Dtl?>Individuals perceive their environment in terms of their individual mental structures that in turn determine their attitudes toward that environment. This is the focus of personal construct theory (PCT), which states that experiences are meaningful only in relation to the way they are "constructed." Within the higher education system, the "constructs" developed by students determine the way in which they perceive their learning environment and are used to judge or evaluate their learning experiences. To reveal the constructs developed by students, a structured interview methodology known as the repertory grid technique can be used. In this paper, the repertory grid technique is exploited to evaluate a consensus-based constructive alignment theory implementation in a M.Sc.-level power systems analysis course. The repertory grid technique is utilized as an approach to effectively gather feedback from students through interviews during course evaluation meetings. It is shown that the repertory grid technique provides much valuable, insightful quantitative and qualitative data. Experience in using this technique revealed shortcomings that are illustrated and discussed in detail. Various visual and statistical methods are applied to analyze the elicited repertory grids. These analyses, along with the other traditional feedback channels, gave insight into the teaching and learning activities (TLAs) involved in implementing Constructive Alignment Theory in a course and helped determine specific elements of the course design needing improvement for future course deliveries, thus helping to improve education in a cornerstone course of power systems engineering.

T1  - Scale Development For Breakfast Cereals Using The Kelly Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 1418712667
AB  - Consumer research is a key component of retail strategy and a major facilitator in the formation of a competitive advantage (Devlin, Birtwistle & Macedo, 2003). A sophisticated research approach that contributes a meaningful understanding of the dynamics of consumer's perceptual orientations is of particular value to retailers (Mitchell, 2001). Gaining knowledge of the attributes consumers value and use to discriminate between products and why those attributes are important can generate a sustainable competitive advantage for retailers (Mitchell & Harris, 2005). Consumer perceptions of product attributes are crucial factors in the choice of food products. A focus on the subjective entities of a product as perceived by consumers is a major determining factor in the success of many product marketing strategies (Kupiec & Revell, 2001). One method that has been utilized to identify product attributes is the Kelly repertory grid method (Kelly, 1955). This method has also been used in previous studies for the recognition of food product attributes (Thomson & McEwan, 1988). The repertory grid technique (RGT) has been adopted in consumer research for examining consumers' perceptions of products and services (Marsden & Littler, 2000). The following research project intends to help retailers understand grocery shoppers' perceptions of breakfast cereals. The objective of the research is two-fold. First, to determine which attributes consumers perceive differences between breakfast cereals. Second, to generate a survey to measure the underlying constructs comprising breakfast cereals using the Kelly Repertory Grid Technique.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using the repertory grid technique to surface strategic planning assumptions
AN  - 1317441368
AB  - Purpose - In his article titled, "The theory of the business," Peter Drucker suggests that organizations need to frequently challenge the assumptions underlying their theory of the business (TOB) in order to assure that it remains viable. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to introduce the repertory grid technique (RGT) and illustrate how it can be used as a strategic planning tool to surface the assumptions underlying an organization's TOB. Design/methodology/approach - The RGT's merits as a planning tool are demonstrated through a case study involving the president of a Pittsburgh-based financial services organization. Specifically, this case study describes how the RGT and the organization's competitors were used to surface the assumptions underlying the organization's TOB. Findings - The paper describes how the assumptions surfaced from this case study can be used to challenge the organization's TOB. Furthermore, guidance is offered as to how the RGT can be integrated into an organization's strategic planning process and a list of resources that one can refer to for further information concerning the RGT is provided. Originality/value - While the RGT has been used by scholars as a research tool and various authors have suggested that it can be used to address various organizational challenges (e.g., implementing a new system), no one to date has demonstrated its value as a strategic planning tool. Consequently, the paper is a valuable resource for practitioners, as well as academics and consultants who provide strategic planning services to organizations.

T1  - Exploring beliefs about heart failure treatment in adherent and nonadherent patients: use of the repertory grid technique
AN  - 2222825208
AB  - Purpose: Beliefs about medicines impact on adherence, but eliciting core beliefs about medicines in individual patients is difficult. One method that has the potential to elicit individual core beliefs is the "repertory grid technique." This study utilized the repertory grid technique to elicit individuals' beliefs about their heart failure treatment and to investigate whether generated constructs were different between adherent and nonadherent patients.
Methods: Ninety-two patients with heart failure were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that applied the repertory grid technique. Patients were asked to compare and contrast their medicines and self-care activities for their heart failure. This lead to the generation of individual constructs (perceptions towards medicines), and from these, beliefs were elicited about their heart failure treatment, resulting in the generation of a repertory grid. Adherence was measured using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS). Patients with a MARS score ≥ 23 were categorized as "adherent" and those with a score ≤ 22 as "nonadherent." The generated grids were analyzed descriptively and constructs from all grids themed and the frequency of these constructs compared between adherent and nonadherent patients.
Results: Individual grids provided insight into the different beliefs that patients held about their heart failure treatment. The themed constructs "related to water," "affect the heart," "related to weight," and "benefit to the heart" occurred more frequently in adherent patients compared with nonadherent patients.
Conclusion: The repertory grid technique elicited beliefs of individual participants about the treatment of their heart failure. Constructs from self-reported adherent patients were more likely to reflect that their medicines and self-care activities were related to water and weight, and affect and benefit to the heart. Providing clinicians with better insight into individuals' beliefs about their treatment may facilitate the development of tailored interventions to improve adherence.

T1  - Thinking About Challenging Behavior: A Repertory Grid Study of Inpatient Staff Beliefs
AN  - 1288355823; 23256689
AB  - Studies examining staffattitudes toward people with intellectual disability have traditionally used pre-determined categories and models or been open to researcher bias. The use of methods derived from personal construct psychology permits an objective investigation of staffviews and attitudes without such limitations. Fourteen stafffrom an inpatient intellectual disability service were interviewed about their perceptions of clients with challenging behavior primarily using the repertory grid technique as developed from personal construct theory. Staffwas found to construe their clients and their behaviors in a heterogeneous manner that was not readily reducible to a group average, and they did not make or use attributions about them in a consistent manner. Future research should incorporate work culture and the staff-client relationship. The results have implications for clinical decision making, team working, and clinical supervision.

T1  - Rigor in qualitative supply chain management research: Lessons from applying repertory grid technique
AN  - 1129462110
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to share the authors' experiences of using the repertory grid technique in two supply chain management studies. The paper aims to demonstrate how the two studies provided insights into how qualitative techniques such as the repertory grid can be made more rigorous than in the past, and how results can be generated that are inaccessible using quantitative methods. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents two studies undertaken using the repertory grid technique to illustrate its application in supply chain management research. Findings - The paper presents insights into supply chain research that otherwise would not have emerged using traditional methods. Both studies derive a comprehensive list of empirical categories of constructs, many of which have not been identified in the extant literature. Moreover, the technique demonstrates that frequently-mentioned constructs are not necessarily the most important. Research limitations/implications - The paper demonstrates how quantitative calculations can strengthen qualitative research. Importantly, from the authors' experience of using the technique the paper details how to focus on demonstrating validity, reliability, and theoretical saturation. Originality/value - It is the authors' contention that the addition of the repertory grid technique to the toolset of methods used by logistics and supply chain management researchers can only enhance insights and the building of robust theories. Qualitative studies that adopt the technique cannot only provide rich insights, but also counter the common criticism aimed at qualitative research - that of failing to provide clear and transparent accounts of the analysis process and how findings are generated from the data set.

T1  - CONTRIBUTIONS OF REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF EATING DISORDERS / APORTACIONES DE LA TÉCNICA DE REJILLA EN LA COMPRENSIÓN DE LOS TRASTORNOS ALIMENTARIOS
AN  - 2231322363
AB  - This research aimed to identify structural aspects and content of the construct system of daughters diagnosed with eating disorders and their mothers. In this descriptive study, the Repertory Grid Technique and a focused interview was undertaken. Participants were 14 young women, 18 to 29 years, and their respective mothers. The results revealed that 70% of daughters and all mothers have cognitive rigidity. Regarding the constructs of self, the contents are mainly grouped in emotional aspects for daughters and in personal aspects for mothers. The contents of the differing constructs of daughters and mothers are grouped into emotional aspects. The most frequent implicative dilemmas refer to the search for autonomy / self-affirmation which involves abandonment of others.
El objetivo de investigación fue identificar características estructurales y de contenido del sistema de constructos de hijas diagnosticadas con trastornos de conducta alimentaria y de sus madres. En este estudio descriptivo, se aplicó a 14 hijas, de 18 a 29 años, y madres, técnica de rejilla interpersonal y entrevista focalizada. En los resultados destaca que el 70% de hijas y la totalidad de madres presentan rigidez cognitiva. En el contenido de los constructos de autodefinición de las hijas destacan aspectos emocionales y en las madres, aspectos personales. Los contenidos de los constructos discrepantes de ambas, se agrupan en aspectos emocionales. En los dilemas implicativos se presenta con mayor frecuencia la búsqueda de autonomía/autoafimación que implica abandono de los demás.

T1  - Exploring the beliefs of heart failure patients towards their heart failure medicines and self care activities
AN  - 1026726571; 22717778
AB  - Aim To identify Heart Failure patients' beliefs towards their medications and how these beliefs relate to adherence. Method Patients attending a multi-disciplinary, community based heart failure clinic on the Gold Coast, Australia were interviewed using a questionnaire composed of fours parts: repertory grid technique; Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ); Medicines Adherence Reporting Scale (MARS); demographic details. Patients were divided into those categorised as adherent (MARS score ≥ 23) and those categorised as non-adherent (MARS score < 23). Necessity beliefs scores from BMQ and the frequency of statements generated from the repertory grid portion of the questionnaire were compared between these two groups. Results Forty-three patients were interviewed with a mean age (±SD) of 64 (±17) years and thirty-six (83.7 %) were male. Thirty-seven (86.0 %) patients were categorised as adherent; the remaining six (14.0 %) as non-adherent. The 43 patients generated a total of 262 statements about their medicines. The three most common themes identified were Related to fluid (36.6 %), Helps the heart (31.7 %) and Related to weight (13.7 %). There was a significantly higher median necessity score in the adherent group compared to the non adherent group (22.0 vs. 19.5, p = 0.0272). Patients with a strong necessity score also had significantly higher self reported adherence compared to patients with a strong concerns score (21.5 vs. 18.0, p = 0.006). Conclusion This study suggests that patients with heart failure possessing a strong belief in the necessity of their treatment regimen are more likely to demonstrate better adherence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cultural differences and students' spontaneous models of the water cycle: a case study of Jewish and Bedouin children in Israel
AN  - 1010969649
AB  - The present research aims at pinpointing differences in spontaneous and non-spontaneous mental models of water cycle conceptions of two 4th grade student groups: the Jewish residents of a small provincial town and a group of students from an indigenous Bedouin community. Students' conceptions were elicited using the Repertory Grid technique as well by being asked to draw "what happens to water in nature?" In later interviews, in addition to answering specially designed open-ended interview questions, the students were also requested to elaborate on their drawings and responses to the Repertory Grid technique. The Bedouin students were found to have richer mental models of water cycle phenomena; their models included more components of the water cycle and were more authentic and connected to other natural phenomena. On the other hand, Bedouin students also employed theological explanations to make sense of water cycle phenomena. These findings, as well as methodological issues relating to spontaneous and non-spontaneous models elicitation are discussed and implications for instruction are offered.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using the Repertory Grid Technique to Examine Nursing Staff's Construal of Mothers with Mental Health Problems
AN  - 1013443139
AB  - This study explored the attitudes of psychiatric nursing staff towards mothers with mental health difficulties. Working with mothers experiencing mental health problems can evoke negative reactions in staff that activate value-laden beliefs regarding the capacity of these women to care for their infants, which could diminish the provision of optimal care and treatment for patients. Ten psychiatric nursing staff working in a specialist mother and baby unit in the North of England were interviewed about their views of various types of client by using the repertory grid technique. A total of 86 constructs that clustered under 21 headings were elicited. All staff made critical judgements about some clients. Staff often described the context in which these perceptions were reached such as the behaviour of clients and the quality of the nurse-client relationship. Clients with a personality disorder and those who were thought to be 'bad' mothers were construed as being furthest from the self and more negatively than clients with depression or psychosis. Further training is indicated for staff working with mothers displaying challenging interactional styles; however, training packages must consider the individuality of perception and experience present within staff groups.

T1  - Bibliometric Review of the Repertory Grid Technique: 1998-2007
AN  - 1030252147
AB  - This bibliometric review covers the scientific production with or about the repertory grid technique (RGT; Kelly, 1955/1991) between 1998 and 2007. An analysis of previous reviews suggests the need for a more careful and broad process of bibliographic research. With this aim, 24 bibliographic sources were used to cover a wide range of specialties. We began by drawing up an explicit protocol in which the research terms were detailed. Then we consulted the bibliographic sources, taking into account a specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result of this process, 973 references were obtained: 468 journal papers, 335 book chapters, 108 doctoral theses, and 62 books. The review also evaluates the types of documents found, the evolution of the number of works published, the repertory grid's fields of application, and the degree of openness to other disciplines. The most relevant authors, their affiliations, countries, and the publication language are also revealed in this article, as well as the major journals contributing to dissemination of the work done with this technique.

T1  - Evaluation of a Positive Youth Development Program Based on the Repertory Grid Test
AN  - 2036415416
AB  - The repertory grid test, based on personal construct psychology, was used to evaluate the effectiveness of Project P.A.T.H.S. (Positive Adolescent Training through Holistic Social Programmes) in Hong Kong. One hundred and four program participants (																					n								=								104																		) were randomly invited to complete a repertory grid based on personal construct theory in order to provide both quantitative and qualitative data for measuring self-identity changes after joining the program. Findings generally showed that the participants perceived that they understood themselves better and had stronger resilience after joining the program. Participants also saw themselves as closer to their ideal selves and other positive role figures (but farther away from a loser) after joining the program. This study provides additional support for the effectiveness of the Tier 1 Program of Project P.A.T.H.S. in the Chinese context. This study also shows that the repertory grid test is a useful evaluation method to measure self-identity changes in participants in positive youth development programs.

T1  - The Amazing Diversity of Thought: A Qualitative Study on How Human Resource Practitioners Perceive Selection Procedures
AN  - 902679414
AB  - In the field of personnel selection, a great deal of evidence shows a gap between what scientists think practitioners should do and which procedures practitioners actually use. To build a basis for an intensified dialog between practitioners and researchers, there is a need for better knowledge about how practitioners think about selection procedures.

              
The authors used the repertory grid technique, a well-established interview method that elicits cognitions. Forty human resource practitioners were interviewed.

              
The results highlight the diversity of the individual ways in which practitioners think about selection procedures. First, none of the constructs elicited was mentioned by two-thirds of the interviewees or more, and only five were mentioned by half or more of the interviewees. Second, interviewees often did not agree which construct pole they preferred. Third, individual maps of the constructs and procedures revealed many differences. Sample constructs were whether a procedure reveals something about the status quo or something about a candidate's past, whether the human resource department has an active or a passive role in the selection process, and whether or not a procedure is fakable. The results suggest many new research questions and will hopefully foster the dialog between scientists and practitioners. This is one of the first studies to explore practitioners' cognitions regarding selection procedures, and represents a rare application of the repertory grid technique to the selection field.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Customer experience quality: an exploration in business and consumer contexts using repertory grid technique
AN  - 902220615
AB  - This study proposes a conceptual model for customer experience quality and its impact on customer relationship outcomes. Customer experience is conceptualized as the customer's subjective response to the holistic direct and indirect encounter with the firm, and customer experience quality as its perceived excellence or superiority. Using the repertory grid technique in 40 interviews in B2B and B2C contexts, the authors find that customer experience quality is judged with respect to its contribution to value-in-use, and hence propose that value-in-use mediates between experience quality and relationship outcomes. Experience quality includes evaluations not just of the firm's products and services but also of peer-to-peer and complementary supplier encounters. In assessing experience quality in B2B contexts, customers place a greater emphasis on firm practices that focus on understanding and delivering value-in-use than is generally the case in B2C contexts. Implications for practitioners' customer insight processes and future research directions are suggested.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluation of a preventive drug education program in Hong Kong using the Repertory Grid Method
AN  - 1711196352
AB  - The repertory grid method based on personal construct psychology was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Project Astro in Hong Kong. Thirty participants (N=30) were invited to complete a repertory grid that was based on personal construct theory to provide both quantitative and qualitative data in measuring self-identity changes after joining the program. Both quantitative and qualitative data generated from the grid method showed that the participants perceived positive changes in the self-representation system joining the program. This study provides additional support for the effectiveness of Project Astro in the Chinese context. This study also shows that repertory grid method is a useful evaluation method to measure self-identity changes in participants in drug prevention programs.

AB  - Life planner is seen as “knowledge worker”, which provides professional services are difficult to express explicitly. For technical aspect of selling process, in addition to life planner’s professional knowledge, to learn and accumulate the experience have to via personal long-period selling experience, community and exchange interaction, and senior’s inheritance. The purpose of this research is focus on tacit knowledge of life planner in selling process research via Repertory Grid Technique. The result shows there was cognition difference existed inevitable among each of the life planners, there are four dimensions: Sale Adaptation, Relationship Capacity、Emotional intelligence and Professional Knowledge, and we can find out the reason and constructs extracted from Repertory Grid Technique. In fact, all the life planners have their personal cognition of sale techniques; moreover, the meaning and interpretation of these sale elements cognitions are difference between experts and non-experts. This research give some advices for people who want to become a life planner, to well know about these four dimensions and familiar with the techniques in each step are necessary. Overall, the concept of life planner can be helpful to well know the tacit knowledge which might be used during personal selling process. Furthermore, it can also make the fresh to understand the meaning and method, so that they can have the technique of selling process and get involved in life planner’s professional domain effectively.

AN  - 744471334
AB  - This study aims at developing an evaluation framework of strategic information systems (SIS) and evaluating the SIS planning and implementation by using a cognitive approach called the repertory grid technique. The findings are based on in-depth interviews with chief information officers (CIOs) involved with SIS developments in their organisations. This exploratory study builds on a cognitive methodology and enables us to develop the evaluation framework of SIS within the CIO's mind. In a practical viewpoint, we evaluated the effectiveness of the essential activities in the SIS planning and implementation. Results showed that activities on analysing industry and environment, analysing information system weakness and strength, formulating SIS strategy, identifying SIS initiatives, prioritising and allocating resources for SIS, documenting SIS, and liaising with top management team are well performed.

T1  - Understanding individual membership at heritage sites
AN  - 225178771
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present George Kelly's The Psychology of Personal Constructs and to discuss how Repertory Grid Technique can aid a better understanding of friends and members in an arts marketing context. The project is a phenomenological study drawing on Kelly's The Psychology of Personal Constructs. The author conducted 16 unstructured face-to-face interviews across the UK during 2007 with individuals who were friends or members of at least five heritage supporter groups as part of a larger mixed methods study. The interviews included the building of Repertory Grids. Analysis of the Repertory Grids gives a detailed understanding of participants' perceptions of, and involvement in, heritage supporter groups. Five themes emerged from the analysis: Organization; Engagement with the Organization; Involvement; Motivation; and Relationships with other members. The paper provides a rich understanding of the portfolio of memberships that individuals have and of how they perceive and interact with them. The paper contributes to the arts marketing literature methodologically by illustrating how to use Repertory Grid Technique in an arts marketing context and by focusing on friends and members, whose perspectives the academic literature does not cover extensively.

T1  - The Repertory Grid Technique as a Method for the Study of Cultural Differences
AN  - 921473784
AB  - Culture is typically approached in the field of design through generic, cross-domain constructs. In this paper we provide an alternative methodological approach to exploring cross-cultural differences by studying the idiosyncratic views of individuals with regard to existing products. We operationalize this approach through the Repertory Grid Technique, a structured interview technique motivated by Kelly's Personal Construct Theory, and propose a content-analytic procedure combining quantitative and qualitative information. We further propose the use of three distinct metrics in the analysis of personal constructs: dominance, importance, and descriptive richness. Dominance of a construct is measured through the relative percentage of a construct category over the total sample of constructs. Importance is measured through the elicitation order; this assumes that constructs elicited first are more salient and important to the individual. Descriptive richness relates to the diversity of a class of constructs. Some constructs might be uni-dimensional while others might tap to a number of distinct facets. The use of these indices enables the quantification of the different ways in which individuals perceive and differentiate between products. By identifying how individuals respond to a rich set of stimuli within a given domain, we inquire into their values and the qualities they appreciate within this restricted domain. Cultural values are thus explored in relation to a set of stimuli. We tested this procedure through an exploration of the ways 17 Dutch and 16 Japanese industrial designers valued a set of pens.

T1  - The quantitative side of the Repertory Grid Technique: some concerns
AN  - 2087791273
AB  - User experience (UX) evaluation is gaining increased interest lately, both from academia and industry. In this paper we argue that UX evaluation needs to fulfill two important requirements: scalability, i.e. the ability to provide useful feedback in different stages of the design, and diversity, i.e. the ability to reflect the di-versity of opinions that may exist in different users. We promote the use of the Repertory Grid Technique as a promising UX evaluation technique and discuss some of our concerns regarding the quantitative side of its use.

T1  - A STUDY OF WEB-DESIGNERS' CRITERIA FOR EFFECTIVE BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER (B2C) WEBSITES USING THE REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE
AN  - 236641480
AB  - Organizations are increasingly using websites not only to capture but also to build relationships with their desired markets. A clear understanding of how best to design effective B2C websites (for both e-commerce and e-service) is therefore vital. Despite its importance, research into the effectiveness of B2C websites remains highly fragmented and user-centric, ignoring the views of web-designers. This study therefore aims to investigate what web-designers consider as attributes of "effective" B2C websites. The relationships amongst attributes are also explored. Twenty web-designers were interviewed using the Repertory Grid Technique in order to elicit factors that they consider important when designing or developing B2C websites. Using a data reduction approach, the elicited attributes were then classified into 14 meta-categories. These meta-categories were compared to prior research. We found that although several meta-categories have been extensively covered in the literature, little attention have been paid to some meta-categories including 'Establishing Website Identity'; 'Categorization of Information'; 'Presentation of Information'; 'Advertisements, Pop-Ups and Animation"; and "Headlines". The inductive approach also permitted the elicitation of the relationships among these meta-categories, giving us a richer understanding of how different website characteristics influence each other. Implications and future research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Attributes of Web Site Usability: A Study of Web Users with the Repertory Grid Technique: IJEC IJEC
AN  - 217683378
AB  - Research on Web site usability using the Microsoft Usability Guidelines (MUG) have (1) assumed the MUG categories and subcategories as a given and (2) focused on the relationships between these attributes and site usability, thereby largely ignoring their underlying meaning. Using the Repertory Grid Technique, the present research elicits the attributes that Web users consider important when using business-to-consumer (B2C) Web sites. The results support the MUG framework but identify three additional attributes that warrant being MUG subcategories: quality of Web site content, Web site appearance, and extent to which the site provides convenient services to facilitate on-line activities. An enhanced MUG is presented. The implications for research and practice are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The repertory grid technique: Its place in empirical software engineering research
AN  - 196418765
AB  - Personal construct theory (applied via the repertory grid technique) supports interpretivist research in a structured manner and, as such, has relevance for researchers conducting studies focused on the human and organisational aspects of software engineering. Personal construct theory (which underpins the repertory grid technique) is introduced, and the technique and its administration is discussed. Research studies from the literature are reviewed to provide illustrative examples of its application within a software engineering context. Since any research approach needs to answer questions about its reliability and validity within a particular study, these issues are considered for repertory grid investigations and criteria are offered that can be used to judge these issues within a planned, and/or reported, study.

T1  - The use of the repertory grid technique to examine staff beliefs about clients with dual diagnosis
AN  - 213888836
AB  - This paper reports a study exploring how individual psychiatric staff construes clients with psychosis who misuse substances. A dual diagnosis of substance misuse is common in clients with psychosis. Previous studies have suggested that psychiatric staff feel ill-equipped to work with these clients, and hold negative views of them, affecting client care and recovery. Understanding staff attitudes can inform training and practice. Twelve psychiatric nursing staff working in an inpatient service for adults with enduring mental health difficulties in England were interviewed. Using a repertory grid technique, staff were asked to describe clients and acquaintances who did and did not misuse substances, themselves and colleagues. All staff made critical judgements of some clients, particularly clients with dual diagnosis, but were less judgemental towards acquaintances who misused substances. Staff who used fewer dimensions to construe people appeared to make a clear distinction between clients and non-clients. This distinction was not apparent for staff with more cognitively complex construct systems. Specific factors that could be implicated in the organization of individuals' construct systems included personal experience of services as a carer; these staff made less distinction between clients and non-clients. Further training is needed for staff working with clients with a dual diagnosis. Training packages need to consider the personal experiences and views of staff. Reducing the boundaries between staff and clients might enable staff to better understand the actions of clients and improve client care.

T1  - Strategies for combating gendered perceptions of careers
AN  - 219366113
AB  - Earlier work on career choice has identified that career choice involves gendered processes which lead to differentiated career outcomes for women and men. However, this literature remained anaemic in offering career counselling strategies for addressing the negative impacts of these processes. The paper aims to explore the creativity cycle and other tools derived from personal construct psychology (PCP) and other feminist literature as potential means for dissolving gendered perceptions of various professions and organisational practices. This is a conceptual paper. Findings - The paper argues that PCP can provide a theoretical and methodological framework for discussing how dichotomous and gender identified the perceptions of professions can be and how such perceptions might be challenged. This theory and its techniques allow us an exploration of the flexibility of one's constructions system, which determines a person's ability to construe alternative views and to develop new ways of understanding oneself and others. The PCP's potential as a technique to combat gendered perceptions of a career is examined. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Construction of Self and Others in Unipolar Depressive Disorders: A Study Using Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 216255606
AB  - This study used Kelly's (1955/1991) Role Construct Repertory Grid (RepGrid) technique to assess cognitive features underlying depressive states. RepGrids from patients with depressive disorders (n = 105, including Major Depression, Dysthymia, and Adjustment Disorder with depressed or mixed symptoms) were compared with a non-clinical group (n = 305). The RepGrids of participants were analyzed using the computer program GRIDCOR (Feixas & Cornejo, 2002). Consistent with hypotheses, those with depressive disorders perceived themselves and others more negatively, perceived themselves as different from others, and generated fewer constructs to describe self and others in comparison to the non-clinical group. There were no differences in use of extreme ratings or in unidimensional construing (percent variance accounted for by the first factor in correspondence analysis) on the RepGrid. RepGrid techniques offer the potential to better understand the processes of construction of the self and others in persons with depressive disorders. Specific RepGrid profiles associated with depression-negativity, resentment, and isolation-may be helpful in further individuating treatment for depression. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - CRM Change Management in an Emerging Country Context: An Exploratory Study in India
AN  - 201692118
AB  - All over the world, change management has found to be very crucial for CRM success. However, the CRM change management does not work the same way across different contexts. Few studies in developed countries assume that a set of prescriptive CRM change management activities works well in any 'given' context. These studies ignore the interplay of organizational actions and the broader context. Drawing on the institutional theory, this study explores this interplay; based on the repertory grid data collected from Indian organizations, it finds how structural and cultural context of an emerging country affects CRM change management activities.

AB  - The explorative study sums up the preliminary findings concerning the research in basic dimensions by means of which it is possible to describe some ways of thinking used by individuals in politicians impression formation. As a research method, one modification of repertory grid technique (REP-test) was used. The findings show the importance of populism dimension and political-ideological dimensions for the complex politician impression, the relation of politicians' sincerity perception and populism, and the linkage of politicians' visibility perception and leadership abilities. The conclusions are taken as preliminary and they are recommended to further verification. The reflection of authors' experience with application of repertory grid technique in the field of politicians impression formation research is a part of discussion. This technique appears to be useful and utilizable in this field. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ascertaining consumer perspectives of medication information sources using a modified repertory grid technique
AN  - 222617999; 17187220
AB  - Objective  To establish the range of medicine information sources used by consumers and their perception of the reliability of these, using the repertory grid technique. Method  Consumers visiting three community pharmacies in Brisbane, Australia, were interviewed using the repertory grid technique. During the interview, consumers were asked to name up to three medicine information sources that they used for a supermarket medicine, an over-the-counter medicine and a prescription medicine. They were then presented with their named information sources in groups of three and asked to discriminate between these in terms of their perceived reliability of the information source. The descriptors used by the consumer to discriminate between the information sources are known as constructs and these were recorded. The consumer was then asked to rate each of their information sources against each generated construct. Main outcome measure  The range of information sources generated was determined along with the perceived reliability of these from the calculated median score of each information source when rated on each generated construct. Results  A total of 110 consumers were interviewed and identified 648 information sources that they would use. The most frequent information sources cited by the 110 consumers were their doctor (83%), written information (90%) and the pharmacist (78%). There were a total of 299 constructs generated by 88 of the consumers and these were themed into 16 discrete categories. The most common generated constructs themes were "good knowledge" (15%), "training" (14%) and "trustworthiness" (13%). The consumer perception of their information sources were that the doctor and pharmacist have good knowledge (median score 1) and are trained (median score 1) and were perceived to be trustworthy (median score 3 and 2, respectively). Conclusion  The repertory grid technique was successful in identifying the information sources consumers accessed to find out about their medicines and in identifying the perception of these sources in terms of their reliability. The repertory grid technique offers a novel method for future research into consumer preferences for different treatment options. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - So, You Think You Know Others' Goals? A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 215839037
AB  - People filter their observations of the world according to their interests, each person using his or her own conceptual framework. So, when we ask them to describe something, their descriptions differ: they might focus on different aspects and choose different terms. In requirements analysis, stakeholders can have varied expertise areas, distinct responsibilities, and divergent goals. As a result, they often express themselves using ambiguous or conflicting terms. Such mismatches in stakeholders' vocabulary can be very hard to detect. We call this terminological interference. Analysis of terminological interference is possible only if we can discover relationships between stakeholders' mental models and the terms they use to describe them. George Kelly's Personal Construct Theory address this issue. According to PCT, individuals develop their own set of mental constructs to help make sense of their environment. Researchers have used this theory to develop techniques for exploring personal construct, most notably the Repertory Grid Technique. The RGT elicits personal constructs by asking people to compare and contrast objects in the domain of interest. Recent research in requirements engineering (RE) has generated a number of notations for modeling stakeholders' goals and the relationships between them. However, the community has paid little attention to how stakeholders can develop consensus on the meaning of the goals in a goal model. In this article, we show how to use the RGT to compare stakeholders' terms when they describe their softgoals (goals whose satisfaction can't be established in a clear-cut sense). We conducted a pilot study for a nonprofit organization to demonstrate our approach. The study shows that the technique can readily identify agreements and mismatches in stakeholders' terminologies and can be performed without preliminary training or specific resources.

T1  - Articulating appraisal system effectiveness based on managerial cognitions
AN  - 214801697
AB  - The aim of this article is to investigate how managers see, interpret and make sense of their performance management system experiences and recommend the way forward for both policy and practice, in what makes effective appraisal systems. The study applied the repertory grid to elicit the personal constructs of how managers make sense of their appraisal experiences. The cognitive mapping methodology allows the researcher to go deep into the respondents' "theories in use" to provide new insights on how they "think". This, in turn, allows a better understanding of the language managers use to make sense of the experiences. Core conceptual dimensions, cognitive maps and cluster diagrams were generated, providing implications for research, practice and new directions for future research. Although the application of the grid technique was time-consuming, the finer grain level of analysis provided a deeper appreciation of managers' "theories in use". The study provides a cross-sectional view of the current state of managerial cognitions. Findings open up new ways of thinking and new way of doing in appraisal research and practice.

T1  - "... There's so much going on unspoken in the back of the mind ..." -The Use of Repertory Grid Technique as a Qualitative Heuristic Research Design to Understand Teachers' Perceptions of Parents
AN  - 869228501
AB  - Studying subjective attitudes has to answer the question about the possibilities of expressing personal systems of meanings and about the possibilities of reconstructing the verbalized meanings by the researchers. Investigating teachers' perceptions of parents leads to two additional problems: teachers' rule of neutrality--which demands not making emotional and degrading statements--, and the normative orientation of "partnership" with parents--which is currently being increasingly discussed in the context of school-development and which makes teachers justify their working together with parents. The Repertory Grid Technique as a method of interview design supports the teachers who have been questioned in verbalizing individual perceptions of parents without using common phrases in their statements. But explicitly integrating the method in a qualitative design raises new questions: According to the currently prevailing orientation towards the typical quantitative Grid-data, qualitative designs are of little interest, so one cannot rely on proven procedures. The procedure described in this article is characterized by using the complete transcription of the interviews with teachers and the analysis of them as texts. The quantitative grid data are only collected for heuristic purposes. This article is a contribution to the discussion of the possibilities of realizing the qualitative potentials of Repertory Grid Technique.              URN: urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs070197

T1  - Exploring parental reactions to the diagnosis of cleft lip and palate
AN  - 218915773; 16634379
AB  - The birth of an infant with a facial cleft evokes a range of emotions and reactions in parents. During acceptance of a child's disability, parents are said to progress through several stages similar to those responses reported in the bereavement process. This paper describes the process of adapting in terms of personal construct theory, and reports a pilot of the repertory grid technique as a therapeutic tool to elicit parental reactions following diagnosis of cleft lip and palate. Two mothers compared other significant life events to their reactions to the diagnosis of cleft lip and palate. This pilot supported the use of the repertory grid technique as a means to facilitate exploration of parental responses. Comparisons to the bereavement process were evident, although individual reactions or perceptions may differ from those expected. Recommendations are made for a wider research study within cleft lip and palate.

T1  - COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES IN REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION AND THE USE OF THE REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE
AN  - 232577832
AB  - Requirements elicitation is a central and critical activity in the systems analysis and design process. This paper explores the nature of the challenges that confront analysts and their clients during requirements elicitation. A review of the literature highlights communication as a persistent locus of concern among systems analysts, users and procurers. The paper presents a classification of communication challenges that arise during the requirements elicitation process. Empirical evidence from a brief case study is used to illustrate the scope and impact of these communication challenges and to present a complementary approach to requirements elicitation. The paper introduces the Repertory Grid technique as a means to ameliorate some of the communication issues that persist, particularly in projects where information systems support specialized work. The paper is written in the form of a case tutorial, providing insight into the contribution of the Repertory Grid technique to requirements elicitation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Structuring a problem is a key part of decision making. For multiple criteria decision problems, defining the criteria is an important element of the structuring process. To provide a decision maker with a general instrument for identifying relevant criteria, two methods representing different approaches were empirically evaluated. This evaluation showed that Kelly's repertory grid technique in particular has several useful features. Accordingly, the repertory grid technique was adapted to build a problem structuring front end for the aspiration-level interactive method proposed by Lotfi, Stewart, and Zionts.

T1  - Improving team performance using repertory grids
AN  - 217099848
AB  - This paper seeks to explore how repertory grids can be used to address IT team performance issues. The technique is introduced along with the process of creating and analyzing repertory grid data. The approach is to explore the application of the repertory grid technique to team performance issues. An example focused on eliciting the essential soft skills needed by programmers to effectively interact with IT team members is illustrated. To researchers, the main benefit of this paper is that it introduces a technique that is easy to use, enables the researcher to easily determine the relationship between constructs, is free from researcher bias, and can be applied to a wide variety of team-related research studies. This research presents a means by which human resource managers, hiring personnel, and team leaders can easily determine essential skills needed on the IT teams of the organization, thereby deriving a "wish list" from key IT groups as to the desired non-technical characteristics of potential new team members.

T1  - THE USE OF RGT (REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE) IN MEASURING THE IMAGE OF SHOPPING CENTERS: REVISTA DE ADMINISTRAÇÃO E INOVAÇÃO REVISTA DE ADMINISTRAÇÃO E INOVAÇÃO
AN  - 883063317
AB  - With the number and variety of shopping centers in Brazil increasing, there is greater pressure on the practitioners of marketing to better understand how consumers choose shopping centers both as shopping and leisure areas. This study suggests that the technique of the repertory grid (RGT) is superior to other techniques which are generally used to evaluate the dimensions which a consumer uses to evaluate a shopping center. The main advantage of the repertory grid is that the dimensions through which an object is evaluated and its relative importance are directly obtained from the consumer with no interference from the researcher. The study introduces a number of necessary basic concepts to understand the application of the technique and the theory on which it is based, the psychology of personal constructs developed by Kelly (1955). The study also presents a number of hypothetical examples of how to apply the technique and its main limitations.

T1  - Using the information seeker to elicit construct models for search engine evaluation
AN  - 231389614
AB  - Crudge and Johnson's article Using the Information Seeker to Elicit Construct Models for Search Engine Evaluation assesses the suitability of using repertory grid technique as a multi-dimensional evaluation instrument of Web search engines. Repertory grid technique is a structured technique for eliciting both the conceptual content embodied in an individual's mental model and the relationships which exist among these concepts. Bipolar statements - good-bad - were elicited from 10 first-year undergraduates in the Department of Information and Communications at Manchester Metropolitan University. It was determined that the repertory grid effectively derived categories of user-determined evaluative constructs, thus providing a user-centered evaluative instrument.[Publication Abstract]

However, many of these findings are predominately based on aspects of the system in judging its overall effectiveness and rely heavily on self-report questionnaire responses with weak methodological rigor. Not much is known about the deeper cognitive perceptions of appraisers and appraisees in better explaining their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. This paper breaks away from conventional questionnaire-generated perceptions and applies a unique clinical cognitive mapping methodology called the repertory grid technique to elicit the personal constructs of how real respondents perceive appraisal systems based on their real-life experiences. The method allowed the investigation to go much deeper than past research into the core perceptions that influenced respondents' attitudes and subsequent behaviors. Though the findings showed some commonality in personal constructions of appraisal systems with those found in the literature, new constructs, core perceptual dimensions, and collective cognitive maps were elicited for the very first time, opening up new questions and issues for further research. Implications to theory and practice are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The dimensions of management team performance: a repertory grid study
AN  - 218423197
AB  - Teamwork is a key feature of work in organizations and a central question in the extensive literature on teams concerns the ways that team performance can be measured. This paper summarizes the concept of team performance and, focussing on management teams, reports the results of an extensive study through 60 repertory grid structured interviews with members of management teams suggests seven factors that represent team performance. The factors are: team purpose; team organization; team leadership; team climate; interpersonal relations; team communications; and team composition. An eighth factor, team interaction with the wider organization, is suggested for theoretical considerations and is included in an eight-factor model of team performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A constructivist model for evaluating postgraduate supervision: a case study
AN  - 213734462
AB  - This paper presents a new constructivist model of knowledge development in a case study that illustrates how a group of postgraduate students defined and evaluated effective postgraduate supervision. This new model is based on "personal construct theory" and "repertory grid technology" which is combined with interviews and group discussion. It is argued that this approach leads to a more meaningful interpretation of results and facilitates formative evaluation and professional development of supervisors. In this case study we discuss details of our evaluation method and its benefits and limitations. We explain how this approach enables both supervisors and students to participate actively in research and development activities, to develop their own constructs or theories of effective supervision, and to communicate their suggestions for improvement. Further applications of this constructivist model to postgraduate supervision practice and to research in higher education are suggested. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Investigating the meaning of supplier-manufacturer partnerships: An exploratory study
AN  - 232594270
AB  - Supplier partnerships can be the key in enhancing the performance of manufacturing companies. Consequently, partnership has been strongly recommended by academics and practitioners alike. Surprisingly, the concept of partnership is only poorly understood. Many authors have identified the advantages that it can bring but far less has been published on the attributes of partnership itself. What is known is that partnerships are close relationships and thus, the level of relationship closeness is an appropriate angle for exploring supplier partnerships. Research was conducted using the repertory grid technique with an exploratory sample of ten managers from four German engineering companies. It revealed that supplier partnerships are very different from other forms of relationship and identified five distinct attributes of partnerships. These findings have a number of implications for both practitioners and researchers.

T1  - The repertory grid technique: A method for the study of cognition in information systems
AN  - 218117283
AB  - Recent studies have confirmed the importance of understanding the cognition of users and information systems (IS) professionals. These works agree that organizational cognition is far too critical to be ignored as it can impact on IS outcomes. While cognition has been considered in a variety of IS contexts, no specific methodology has dominated. A theory and method suitable to the study of cognition - defined as personal constructs that individuals use to understand IT in organizations - is Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory and its cognitive mapping tool known as the repertory grid (RepGrid). This article expounds on the potential of this technique to IS researchers by considering the variety of ways the RepGrid may be employed. The flexibility of the RepGrid is illustrated by examining published studies in IS. The diagnostic qualities of the RepGrid and its mapping outcomes can be used for practical intervention at the individual and organizational levels.

T1  - Body experience and mental representation of body image in patients with haematological malignancies and cancer as assessed with the body grid
AN  - 218910849; 11780798
AB  - The domain of body image plays a central role in the quality of life of patients with haematological malignancies and metastasized cancer, since the disease itself as well as the enrolled therapies interfere with psychological and bodily well-being. We approached this highly subjective field by using the repertory grid technique and hypothesized that patients would display a restricted body image, focusing on functional aspects of the body. In all, 55 in-patients (27 men, 28 women, M age = 45.7 yrs, N = 46 with haematological malignancies, N = 9 with metastasized cancer), at the time of initial diagnosis, were included in the study and assessed with the Body Grid, an instrument specifically designed by us for the exploration of body image. The data were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) and construct categorization. Further, 42 chronic tinnitus sufferers (20 male, 22 female, M age = 46.5 yrs) served as a comparison group. Based on the constructs elicited, six construct categories were formulated in the sense of a first attempt of a hierarchical model (emotion, control, activity, strength, function, appearance). The central constructs (373 construct pairs) were assigned to these categories by three inter-raters. The categories appeared in the following order of frequency: function (27.1%), emotion (20.4%), strength (20.1%), activity (15%), control (10.2%) and appearance (7.2%). PCA indicated that the patients mainly demonstrated a restricted view of their body. In the tinnitus group, the most frequent category proved to be activity (21.3%), closely followed by function (21.1%) and control (20.9%). The body image was also restricted (PCA). The restriction of body image, together with the specific construct choice, seen in the haematology and cancer patients reflects the existential threat of the disease and may serve as a coping strategy. The high percentage of emotional constructs may mirror the patients' need for further support. The distinct distribution of construct categories in the two different patient samples supports the applicability of the proposed preliminary model.

T1  - Repertory grid technique - An interpretive research framework
AN  - 237021142
AB  - A study examines some of the underlying assumptions, research objectives and practical applications of the repertory grid technique (RGT) in consumer research. It explains why the use and evaluation of the RGT should be grounded in the assumptions of the theory from which it derives, George Kelly's personal construct psychology (PCP), and examines the way in which it is both congruent with and can contribute to the development of the emerging interpretive paradigm in consumer research. The specific questions that the RGT can help to answer about consumer behaviour experience are identified and illustrated with the findings from a short empirical study. Overall, it is argued that when the RGT is employed within the guidelines of PCP it provides a useful interpretive research framework for exploring some of the similarities and differences in the content and structure of consumers' subjective meaning systems.

T1  - Exploring consumer product construct systems with the repertory grid technique
AN  - 213434911
AB  - Over the last 25 years the repertory grid technique (RGT) has been widely employed as a qualitative method in market research. Originally developed by George Kelly (1955) to explore the subjective meanings that people attach to their world, the RGT has particularly been adopted in consumer research for examining consumers' perceptions of products and services, most notably in means-end chain analysis. Despite its relative widespread use, however, the full potential of the RGT as a qualitative method has yet to be realised, either in market research in general or consumer research in particular, for a number of reasons.  The aim of this paper is to show how the RGT and theory can be employed in market research as a qualitative method for exploring the nature and form of the network of subjective meanings that consumers attach to their consumption experiences, what are termed here consumers' product construct systems (PCSs).

T1  - Hong Kong student teachers' personal construction of teaching efficacy [1]
AN  - 208811074
AB  - This study employed the repertory grid technique to investigate how a sample of 27 student teachers in Hong Kong developed a personal sense of teaching efficacy. The analysis indicated that the third year students' perceptions were more homogenous than were those of the first year students.

T1  - Perceptions of software quality: a pilot study
AN  - 235083944
AB  - Many software quality initiatives fail because they do not take account of the range of views that people have of quality. New approaches to software quality improvement will not work unless software developers believe in them, no matter how enthusiastic managers may be. This paper reports on a pilot study using the repertory grid technique that found evidence to support these assertions. The study findings justify further work and show that while the repertory grid technique is an appropriate instrument in this area it is resource intensive to apply and may not be practical in a wider study of a representative sample of the IT industry. The paper has practical recommendations for successful introduction of new software quality programmes. These recommendations stress the need for effective communication, leading to a shared understanding of 'quality', and for realistic goals that recognize the pressure of development schedules.

T1  - Team performance: using repertory grid technique to gain a view from the inside
AN  - 217098014
AB  - Measuring team performance through use of repertory grid technique is novel; it appears to have some advantages over the use of conventional questionnaires and inventories. Once a set of constructs relevant to a particular team's circumstances is generated, it can be used at regular intervals to measure changes in team performance. A particular set of constructs, though, may have a limited life. As the purpose and processes of a team change, the constructs relevant to that team's performance may need to change with new sets of constructs identified, using the same technique as before. Thus the method of measuring team performance is dynamic, keeping pace with changes in the team itself.

T1  - Understanding the basis of treatment choices for varicose veins: a model for decision making with the repertory grid technique.
AN  - 1770033679
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use the repertory grid technique as a method for identifying and rating the criteria that clinicians use to make a choice between the different treatment options for patients with a common condition such as varicose veins. DESIGN: The "expert panel" consensus method for rating the appropriateness of clinical procedures was modified with an existing psychometric method, the repertory grid technique. To identify the criteria used to decide about treatment, the panel members compared and contrasted a range of nine "treatment prototypes". They were then required to rate each criterion for its relevance to each treatment prototype. SETTING: The panel was selected from different geographical locations in the South Western Regional Health Authority. SUBJECTS: The expert panel was composed of six vascular surgeons, three from teaching and three from non-teaching hospitals; two general practitioners who were also clinical assistants in vascular surgery; and one honorary senior lecturer in general practice. MAIN MEASURES: Decision making criteria were categorised according to their content. Their frequency of replication was noted-that is, how many clinicians used the same criterion. Computer analysis of the rating scores for the nine panel members identified the relative importance of each treatment criterion for each treatment option. RESULTS: 161 criteria for the treatment of varicose veins were elicited from the nine participants. These criteria were wide ranging, from clinical indications (48% of those used), to social (32%), and organisational factors (20%). Clinical indications were more likely to be used when deciding about surgery as a high priority, whereas social and organisational criteria were more likely to be applied in decisions about surgery as a low priority, day case surgery, and cosmetic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The repertory grid technique proved to be effective in modelling decision making for a condition such as varicose veins: its use enabled both the identification of the wide range of criteria underlying the decision to treat and the exploration of the relative importance of these criteria in relation to several treatment options. Its potential as a method for reducing variation in clinical decision making and thus improving distribution of high quality care lies in its ability to pinpoint dilemmas of decision making rather than as the basis for drawing up guidelines to regulate decision making practice.

T1  - Using repertory grids in management
AN  - 215399890
AB  - Since 1980, many changes have occurred in both the use and the application of the repertory grid technique. Unlike the initial monograph, this paper places greater emphasis on practicalities of completing a grid and the different types of analysis possible than on the applications of the grid. The grid offers a powerful way of quantifying people's attitudes, feelings, and perceptions. It focuses on how an individual focuses on how a single individual understands his or her own world in a particular context.

T1  - Validating a method for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures
AN  - 231420805; 01090536; 02501907
AB  - Cognitive mapping techniques refer to methods used to elicit the structure and content of people's mental models.  There is growing interest in applying these techniques to the study of managers' mental models of strategic management issues.  A new method is suggested for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures, that is based upon recent developments in the cognitive psychology of the categorization of concepts.  The method is evaluated with respect to its psychometric properties against the well established, but potentially cumbersome, repertory grid technique.  The method is demonstrated to have good validity by comparing it with the repertory grid technique.

T1  - Understanding customers' views: An example of the use of repertory grid technique: MRN
AN  - 223524091; 00991231
AB  - Repertory grid testing was used as part of a marketing research project.  The goal of the investigation was to use interviews to identify how customers perceive product support for high-technology products (using the medical equipment market as a test case).  Product support is the name given in industry to the various forms of assistance that companies provide to customers to help them obtain maximum value from high-technology products.  Several key points emerged from the interviews: 1.  Interviews need careful design and piloting, to ensure that they achieve the research goals and fit with the boundary conditions of the sample and market under investigation.  2.  The repertory grid method can be used to help subjects articulate their views on a complex topic, in a situation where direct questioning is liable to cause interviewer bias.  3.  The repertory grid method  produces clear descriptions on constructs - so that they are unequivocal.

AB  - Abstract. The selection and evaluation of road schemes through the Leitch framework is based on a combination of cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment. Both techniques involve the definition and valuation of a number of costs and benefits. These costs and benefits are defined and valued in isolation to each other so that we Imow virtually nothing about the relative valuation that people assign to different types of costs and benefits which might affect them directly or indirectly. This paper outlines the development of a method which allows people to conceptualise the costs and benefits of a road scheme in their own terms and then to rank schemes in relation to those costs and benefits. This method is based upon an interview process involving the use of repertory grid technique. The information from the repertory grid technique is used as a sound basis for determining trade-offs between attributes and for attempting to obtain monetary valuations of different project attributes. A number of exploratory interviews are reported which outline some of the difficulties with a number of the survey features including the choice of case-study, interviewer and information biases and sample and non-response biases. Various ways of dealing with these difficulties are discussed.

T1  - Validation of the Repertory Grid for Use in Modeling Knowledge
AN  - 216897484
AB  - The extrapolation of theories of cognitive modeling from psychological contexts to the domain of informa tion systems design has raised empirical questions re garding the validity and reliability of these techniques In the new applications environment. Kelly's (1955) theory of personal construct psychology (PCP) is one such theory which, together with the repertory grid technique of cognitive modeling, is being explored for use in sys tems development. Since the repertory grid constitutes a mechanism for both the elicitation and the representa tion of cognitive models, it has been suggested for incorporation into intelligent front-end interfaces for in formation storage and retrieval systems (ISRS). Previ ous applications of the grid have emphasized the personal and ideographic characteristics of personal construct systems. New applications in information sys tems design require verification of the grid's utility and reliability for rendering faithful representations of im personal and communal knowledge. The research pre sented here provides a test of the repertory grid for representing commonality of construing among mem bers of a homogenous group of subjects. Commonality of construing is demonstrated on two sets of constructs. Some differences are observed between constructs generated by the subjects and those provided for them by an "expert." Implications of this effect for the appli cation of PCP to ISRS design are discussed.

T1  - Repertory Grid Technique in Employee Selection
AN  - 214808582; 00509200
AB  - The repertory grid technique (RGT) is a psychological technique capable of elucidating the person-job match and the job-person match in employee selection.  The grid basically is a sorting exercise designed to elicit the dimensions, criteria, or constructs underlying an individual's rationale for all sorting decisions made.  Although essentially different, the task reactions repertory grid and the interview perceptions repertory grid hint at 2 inherent advantages - flexibility of design and face validity to participants.  Despite potential disadvantages with grids, the RGT and the underlying theoretical stance of personal construct psychology have much potential as an alternative and complementary strategy in employee selection.  When considering uses of the grid where the recruiter is acting as a participant, 3 interrelated applications arise: 1.  interviewer training, 2.  interviewer selection, and 3.  the identification of candidate assessment criteria.  A 2nd set of grid applications involves the applicant as the participant and follows from the contention that the RGT could be used to examine the job-person match.

T1  - Repertory Grid Combined with Learning Styles: A Pilot Study
AN  - 214112858; 00365817
AB  - The preferences of a learner are important to consider when attempting to make a learning event effective.  Honey and Mumford (1986) defined 4 basic learning styles: 1.  activists, 2.  reflectors, 3.  theorists, and 4.  pragmatists.  A research project, designed to investigate the learning style of individuals and to use the results to help in personal coaching and development sessions, used the Repertory Grid technique in combination with Honey and Mumford's Learning Style Questionnaire (LSQ).  The Repertory Grid is a method of understanding and structuring how people perceive things and make distinctions between various aspects of their environment.  During the study, each individual was given the Repertory Grid to complete, then asked to complete the LSQ.  The difference between each set of ratings was noted, as well as the ratings depicting "learned the most" and "learned the least." All the study's participants felt the results were indicative of their personal learning styles.
