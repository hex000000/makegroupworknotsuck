T1  - Cognition difference between players of different involvement toward the concrete design features in music games
AN  - 2221213725
AB  - When designing mobile games, how to understand preferences and cognition of players is a topic worth exploring. The main objectives of this paper are to obtain design features of music games on mobile devices, and explore players’ perceptions toward music games. The results can serve as an orientation during decision-making in game design. Based on Miryoku Engineering and the Evaluation Grid Method, this study interviewed 22 frequent users to get concrete features of game design; Moreover, 210 subjects were divided into high, medium, and low involvement groups according to CIP measures, and then this study used Multiple Regression analysis to determine whether players with different levels of involvement had different perceptions of the design features of music games. The results found 44 concrete features and six original evaluations items of game design, and also discovered that there were perception differences in different involvement groups, and only two concrete design features significantly influenced all three groups: ‘Extra games to earn more points after completing levels’ and ‘Playable without internet’.

T1  - Measuring brand image: a systematic review, practical guidance, and future research directions
AN  - 2200124820
AB  - Measuring and understanding brand image is crucial for both branding research and practice. Empirical studies focusing on brand image reveal a large number of techniques for measuring brand image, highlighting the need to organize them. However, no comprehensive review of brand image measurement techniques can be found in the existing literature. Therefore, this article seeks to contribute to the extant knowledge of brand image by systematically reviewing the related literature, providing a comprehensive discussion and characterization of brand image measurement techniques, offering recommendations for measuring brand image through a roadmap, and suggesting directions for future research. Our systematic literature review identified 224 high-quality scholarly articles published between 1991 and 2016 using 12 main techniques for measuring brand image. This article may aid both researchers and brand managers in selecting and applying appropriate brand image measurement techniques for their specific research context.

T1  - Qualitative Research on Use of Voice of Customer in Czech Organisations
AN  - 2256020267
AB  - The article presents qualitative research conducted on a sample of Czech organisations operating in the B2C relationships within the Internet environment. The research aims to determine the approach of the organisations to the collecting and analysing Voice of Customer in measuring share-of-mind metrics as constituent elements of Customer Experience. Research improves the current knowledge and setting of Voice of Customer in Customer Experience and its measurement and management in a real business setting. From the interviews is observed the low maturity in Customer Experience in Czech companies and often a misunderstanding of the concept. The companies are not fully entrenched in analysing Voice of Customer with text analytics. The barriers of getting the full potential of analysing Voice of Customer within Customer Experience are identified. The article is a part of the initial research to ‘Voice of Customer integration in Customer Experience measurement’ in the author’s dissertation and will also be published as a chapter in the author’s dissertation.

T1  - SHOPPING EXPERIENCE AND SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY
AN  - 2176184352
AB  - While a traditional marketer aims to enhance customer loyalty, a social marketer focuses on the creation of individual well-being. To date, some social marketing programs have been launched to enhance individual well-being. However, only a few studies have been oriented to investigate subjective well-being, in the domain of traditional marketing. Previous studies have indicated that service quality is an important determinant of subjective well-being for a service organization's customers. However, this notion is not enough as service quality only captures performance of service in the level of attribute. For that reason, this introduces the notion of experience quality as the determinant of subjective well-being. To have a better knowledge about the relationship between these constructs, this study also inserted the notion of customer satisfaction and perceived shopping enjoyment as mediating variables. Two hundred respondents participated in this study. These respondents were recruited at department stores in Malang, a city in the Province of East Java. A self-administered survey was conducted to collect the data. A Covariance Based Structural Equation Model (CBSEM) was employed to analyze the data. The results of a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) confirmed the model proposed. The structural model showed that the experience of shopping has significant effects on customer satisfaction, perceived shopping enjoyment, and subjective well-being. However, this study failed to prove the mediating effects of customer satisfaction and perceived shopping enjoyment in the relationship between the shopping experience and subjective well-being. Upon the completion of this study, both theoretical and practical contributions were provided.

T1  - EXAMINATION OF REGIONAL DISPARITY IN THE LEVEL OF TOURIST OFFER IN RURAL CLUSTERS OF SERBIA
AN  - 2129415515
AB  - Serbia is a country known for turbulent historical events, which completely disrupted the economic and political state of the country, and which had negative effects on the country's tourist development. In this research, the authors pointed to the current state of the level of services provided in rural parts of Serbia, and on the basis of the obtained data, found that there are disparities in the examined clusters when it comes to the level and quality of the services provided. So far, only a small number of authors have pointed to this issue, however, this research discusses a key problem that has negative implications for the development of rural tourism in Serbia. By including results in further research related to rural tourism, it is possible to develop long-term plans for removing regional disparities in rural clusters in Serbia.

T1  - MULTINATIONALISM, RUSSIAN MENTALITY AND NATIVES' ATTITUDES TOWARDS IMMIGRANTS: EVIDENCE FROM SURVEY EXPERIMENTS ACROSS BORDERLAND REGIONS OF RUSSIA
AN  - 2070393273
AB  - The Russian national politicy piorities are centered around preservation of historically determined ethno-cultural diversity, consolidation of multi-national people of Russia, including those who live abroad, under the ideology of all-Russian civic nation. Their implementation is naturally influenced by intense labour and transit migration, changing ethnic landscape of Russian regions. The analysis of inter-ethnic relations (structured interviews, n=4437, aged 15-75 years) in nine regions of Russia (Altai, Transbaikal, Kemerovo, Omsk, Orenburg, Amur regions, Jewish autonomous region, Republic of Altai and Republic of Karelia) has shown that most respondents have neutral or positive feelings towards strangers. Negative attitudes are explained by reluctance of some ethnic groups to respect Russian customs and norms of behavior as well by the threat of terrorism. Attitudes towards migrants (psychosemantic research in four border regions - the Altai region, the Amur region, the Republic of Karelia and the Jewish autonomous region, n=400, aged 15-70 year, of modified repertory grids technics) are characterized by high importance of characteristics, related to identification, emotional evaluation, security, social and economic position in the assessment of meta-ethnic groups. Migrants weren't associated with national threats but were perceived as a group with conservative views, low educational and cultural level, depending from receiving society. In general, public opinion of border regions regarding the assessment of inter-ethnic relations is very polarized. Considering peculiarities of self-perception and dispositions of population of towards migration and migration policy, it appears that further harmonization in the inter-ethnic sphere in Russian borderland requires more sophisticated approaches, combining general priorities of the state policy with regional needs to preserve ethno-cultural uniqueness and struggle with tough migration issues.

T1  - Structuring educational decisions using the multiple sorting task: An example focusing on international placements in nursing
AN  - 1940619337
AB  - Practical examples of the steps involved in the planning and execution of the multiple sorting task are frequently lacking in published reports. This article demonstrates how the multiple sorting task can be used to structure conversations with a group of health professionals planning an international placement for nursing students. Sixteen participants were drawn from diverse professional backgrounds, including academia, clinical practice, government policy, and placement administrators. Participants sorted 17 statements written on cards into categories of their choice and noted why they sorted the cards into these particular groups. Data were analysed using multidimensional scaling and qualitative perspectives. The analysis identified four key themes that detailed the participants’ views about international placements. These findings demonstrate how the multiple sorting task can be used to generate information that facilitates the examination of important facets of health care practice that universities could cover in preparing students for international placements.

T1  - The Construal of Midwives by Pregnant Women with a Body Mass Index Greater Than or Equal to 30kg/m2 (BMI> or =30kg/m2): A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 1886551935
AB  - Objective

              
To explore the construal of midwives by pregnant women with a body mass index greater than 30kg/m2 (BMI≥30kg/m2).

              
Method

              
Ten pregnant women with a BMI≥30kg/m2 were recruited from antenatal clinics at a maternity hospital in the North West of England. Each participant completed a repertory grid. The participants chose people to match roles including themselves, pregnant women, midwives of different BMIs and hypothetical elements. They also generated psychological constructs to describe them.

              
Results

              
Pregnant women with a BMI≥30kg/m2 construed themselves as vulnerable and self-conscious. Some women endorsed obesity-related stereotypes for themselves and felt responsible for their weight. The midwife with a BMI 18<30kg/m2 was considered to be most similar to the ideal midwife, while the midwife with a BMI≤18kg/m2 was construed as having an undesirable interpersonal style. The midwife with a BMI≥40kg/m2 was often construed as sharing similar experiences to the pregnant women with a BMI≥30kg/m2, such as struggling with the psychological consequences of a raised BMI. Some women construed the midwife with a BMI 30<40kg/m2 in a positive way, whereas others viewed it as sharing similar feelings about weight as the midwife with a BMI≥40kg/m2.

              
Conclusions

              
The pregnant women with a BMI≥30kg/m2 in this study described perceptions of themselves and the midwives responsible for their care, which may affect their engagement and satisfaction with services. Pregnant women with a BMI≥30kg/m2 should be involved in service development activities to ensure the structure of services and the language used by midwives are acceptable and do not confirm weight-related stereotypes. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

              
Key Practitioner Message

              
Pregnant women with a BMI≥30kg/m2 construe themselves as vulnerable and self-conscious and perceive themselves responsible for their weight.

              
Pregnant women with a BMI≥30kg/m2 construe midwives with a low BMI as having an undesirable, cold, interpersonal style.

              
Midwives with a raised BMI are construed as similar to the women, because they share the uncomfortable psychological consequences of a raised BMI.

              
The nature of pregnant women's construal may affect their engagement and satisfaction with maternity services and midwifery care.

T1  - The characteristics of railway service disruption: implications for disruption management
AN  - 1878812010
AB  - Rail disruption management is central to operational continuity and customer satisfaction. Disruption is not a unitary phenomenon - it varies by time, cause, location and complexity of coordination. Effective, user-centred technology for rail disruption must reflect this variety. A repertory grid study was conducted to elicit disruption characteristics. Construct elicitation with a group of experts (n = 7) captured 26 characteristics relevant to rail disruption. A larger group of operational staff (n = 28) rated 10 types of rail incident against the 26 characteristics. The results revealed distinctions such as business impact and public perception, and the importance of management of the disruption over initial detection. There were clear differences between those events that stop the traffic, as opposed to those that only slow the traffic. The results also demonstrate the utility of repertory grid for capturing the characteristics of complex work domains.

              
Practitioner Summary: The aim of the paper is to understand how variety in rail disruption influences socio-technical design. It uses repertory grid to identify and prioritise 26 constructs, and group 10 disruption types, identifying critical factors such as whether an incident stops or merely slows the service, and business reputation.

T1  - The Group Analytic Model
AN  - 2007102673
AB  - Drawing upon psychoanalysis, sociology, and group dynamics, the basic clinical model of group analysis was first described by Foulkes (1948, 1964) and Foulkes and Anthony (1964): Four men and four women, plus the conductor, sit around a small table and engage in free-floating conversation for a 90-minute session once a week. Groups might meet more often and be supplemented by combined or conjoint therapy (Maratos, 2000). All group members actively engage in treatment processes, but the conductor is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the boundaries of the group and facilitating the processes of clarification, translation, and interpretation. The conductor should resist being tempted to give personal information to patients and should not violate the boundaries of the group in ways that impede the development of the group and the individuals within it (Sharpe, 2005). Further descriptions of this model can be found in Roberts and Pines (1991).

T1  - TOWARDS A HOLISTIC CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ENTERPRISES
AN  - 1843292537
AB  - We have entered the age of the customer where customer choice is the main differentiator between enterprises. Therefore, enterprises need to shift their focus to customer experience management (CEM). A survey conducted within the telecommunications sector indicated a gap between theoretical CEM approaches and their implementation in enterprises. Although a systematic literature review and inductive thematic analysis of CEM literature revealed nine common themes, none of the existing approaches includes all of these themes in a comprehensive way. Based on those nine themes, this paper presents a new holistic framework for CEM that managers and practitioners concerned with improving customer experiences could use.

T1  - Dementia-specific quality of life instruments: a conceptual analysis
AN  - 1809162611
AB  - Background:

              
Over the past 20 years, many researchers have worked in developing various methods for measuring quality of life (QoL) of people with dementia. The aim of this review is to develop the conceptual frameworks of the dementia-specific QoL instruments, to identify their evolution over time and to provide elements of reflection on the QoL concept in dementia and its evaluation.

              
Methods:

              
An electronic search was conducted on PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases, from January 1985 to June 2015 using a combination of key words that include QoL, dementia, and review.

              
Results:

              
The analysis of the conceptual frameworks of the 18 selected dementia-specific QoL tools shows a great diversity in: (1) the QoL definitions (e.g. health-related QoL definitions, QoL definitions based on Lawton's work, or similar to this latter); (2) the theoretical QoL models (e.g. Lawton' work and modified Lawton, adaptation, personhood); (3) the domains and dimensions; (4) the way to construct the instrument (e.g. development based on literature, opinion of the experts), and (5) the items' formulation (e.g. use of criterion of intensity or frequency).

              
Conclusions:

              
There are different conceptual frameworks in the dementia-specific QoL measures with improvements over time (e.g. inclusion of interesting concepts such as adaptation, taking into account the views of patients themselves). Each of the conceptual parameters (definitions, models, domains, and dimensions) is discussed to identify the scales that are conceptually the strongest. Through their review, recommendations for future instrument refinement and development are discussed and a new QoL definition is proposed.

AN  - 1905750173
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the relationship between personality traits (introversion versus extroversion) and knowledge acquisition (KA) techniques. Design/methodology/approach The major methodology of the current study is survey. Results are based on 152 usable responses provided by experts in different industries including electronic, communication, information technology, computer and biology. The major analytical technique used is Pearson correlation analysis. Findings According to the results, there are significant relationships between personality traits (i.e. introversion versus extroversion) and KA techniques. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted on data from 152 Iranian experts which limits the generalizability of the results. This limitation can be addressed by future studies conducting similar studies on cross-country samples. Further, due to the analytical technique adopted in this study, causality implications cannot be drawn from the results. Originality/value This study reveals linkages between personality traits (i.e. introversion versus extroversion) and KA techniques. Results shed light on the KA process for both scholars and practitioners involved in KA programs in the organizations.

T1  - A conceptual framework for assessing universities websites within gulf region
AN  - 1788338801
AB  - The aim of this document is to review literature and evaluate the websites of universities situated in the Gulf region, with respect to student, teaching staff and management. Secondly, having a complete structure of such important points in place, aids in evaluating website through the Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Data was retrieved from Web of knowledge and other relevant source. Subsequent to scrutiny of research papers, all the appropriate data was obtained from these papers and articles to find a common aspect that justified the focal point of this research. The arbitrating variable was then studied independently with respect to the knowledge available from secondary data sources. Subsequent to obtaining the facts, we incorporated and arranged the information into a methodical order for moving over to the analysis phase for plugging in the gaps found in the study. Literature illustrated that for academic institution website, there are four important elements i.e. design quality, content quality, content organization and user-friendly quality.

T1  - Structural-phenomenological features of the internal picture of doctors’ illnesses
AN  - 2168195715
AB  - The vocational activities of doctors and their social status do not ensure their health. And, falling ill, doctors don’t identify themselves with ordinary patients as they have a deep knowledge of medicine. Thus, the internal picture of a doctor’s illness is both a research and a practical problem: the problem of the psychoprevention of doctors’ illnesses at all stages of their professionalization. The purpose of the research was to study the phenomenological features of the internal picture of doctors’ illnesses using the structural approach. The total number of participants was 132. The experimental group consisted of 66 sick doctors, differentiated according to their stage of professionalization: vocational training (students), professional adaptation (interns), full professionalization (doctors). The control group consisted of 66 people who did not have any medical education. All the control subjects were hospitalized with chronic diseases during the study period. The organization of the research was carried out with the use of clinical-psychological and diagnostic methods, the methods of descriptive statistics, and comparative, multidimensional, and structural analysis. The research revealed the following phenomenological features of the internal picture of doctors’ illnesses: the prevalence of some anxiety in the doctors and high awareness of their health; the doctors’ altruistic orientation; their willingness to work despite difficulties; and their ability to achieve high results in different activities. The structural features of the doctors’ image of their own diseases on the cognitive level were the following: qualitative heterogeneity during in-service activities; a high degree of image integration during in-service activities; and stereotyped perceptions of the disease. The emotional level revealed the emotional distance between doctors and their patients, and the behavioral level revealed doctors’ disregard for the symptoms of the disease. The structural-phenomenological features of the formation of the internal picture of doctors’ illnesses are specific to the circumstances of their origin. For the purpose of the psychoprevention of doctors’ own diseases it is necessary to include these features in the special courses on medical psychology at the stages of vocational training (students) and professional adaptation (interns), as well as in the “psychology in practical medicine” project for doctors.

T1  - Team Performance Scale for Hospitality Professionals
AN  - 1800179810
AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop a suitable measure of team performance for Indian hospitality professionals. A total of 279 hospitality professionals working in different hotels generally higher-class hotels, star hotels located in different cities of U.P. (India) voluntarily participated in the study. The scale consisted of 9 items adapted from the scales of Lurey and Raisinghani, (2000) and Senior, (1996). Descriptive statistics, Item-total correlation, internal consistency, reliability and Exploratory Factor Analysis were used to examine the psychometric properties of the scale. The result of item analysis indicated that all the 9 items found to be significant. Exploratory Factor Analysis using Principal Component Analysis and varimax rotation identified only one factor solution of team performance scale. The factor identified was related to teams' overall abilities to perform their work assignments. The internal consistency reliability was found to be .88 for the overall scale. In conclusion, the results provide evidence for the sound reliability and construct validity of 9-item Team Performance Scale and use of the 9-item version can be recommended in future research. Implications of the findings and recommendations for future research of the scale were discussed.

T1  - An espoused cultural perspective to understand continued intention to use mobile applications: a four-country study of mobile social media application usability
AN  - 1678989672
AB  - As most mobile applications are tailored for worldwide consumption, it is a significant challenge to develop applications that satisfy individuals with various cultural backgrounds. To address this issue, we drew on a recently developed conceptualization and associated instrument of mobile application usability to develop a model examining the impact of mobile social media application usability on continued intention to use. Drawing on Hofstede's five cultural values, we incorporated espoused cultural values of masculinity/femininity, individualism/collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation into our model as moderators. To test the model, we collected data from 1,844 consumers in four countries - the U.S., Germany, China, and India - who use mobile social media applications on their smartphones. The results provided support for the role of espoused national cultural values in moderating the impact of mobile social media application usability on continued intention to use and the model, with espoused cultural values explaining significantly more variance in continued intention to use (i.e., 38%) than the main effects-only model (i.e., 19%). Interestingly, our results demonstrated that culture at the national level did not play a significant role in affecting the relationship between usability constructs and continued intention to use, thus underscoring the importance of espoused culture.

T1  - Consumers' questions about antipsychotic medication: revealing safety concerns and the silent voices of young men
AN  - 1674192543
AB  - Little is known about consumer information needs regarding antipsychotic medicines. Medicines call centre (MCC)-derived data are underutilised; and could provide insight into issues of importance to consumers. This study aimed to explore consumers' information needs about antipsychotic medication sought from a national MCC in Australia.

              
Questions received by the National Prescribing Service Medicines Line relating to antipsychotic medication from September 2002 to June 2010 were examined by antipsychotic subclass and in relation to other medication queries.

              
We identified 6,295 calls related to antipsychotic medication. While female callers predominated, the percentage of males with antipsychotic questions was statistically significantly higher than for other medication calls (33.9 vs 22.6 %; p < 0.001). There were distinct gender differences in medicines information seeking across age ranges. Younger men asked about second-generation antipsychotics, shifting toward first-generation antipsychotics after 45 years of age. Female interest in both subclasses was comparable, irrespective of age. Most callers asking about antipsychotics sought information for themselves (69.4 %). Callers were primarily concerned about safety (57.0 %), especially adverse drug reactions (28.8 %), and were more often prompted by a worrying symptom (23.8 %) compared with the rest of calls (17.2 %). Trends of antipsychotic questions received corresponded with antipsychotic prescription data.

              
The number of calls received by this MCC over time reveals an ongoing consumer need for additional, targeted information about antipsychotics. Noticeable was the relatively high frequency of young male callers asking about antipsychotics, indicating that call centres could be a way to reach these traditionally poor users of health services.

T1  - Interrater reliability of mechanical tests for functional classification of transtibial prosthesis components distal to the socket
AN  - 1708137616
AB  - Substantial evidence suggests that the design and associated mechanical function of lower-limb prostheses affects user health and mobility, supporting common standards of clinical practice for appropriate matching of prosthesis design and user needs. This matching process is dependent on accurate and reliable methods for the functional classification of prosthetic components. The American Orthotic & Prosthetic Association developed a set of tests for L-code characterization of prosthesis mechanical properties to facilitate functional classification of passive below-knee prosthetic components. The mechanical tests require use of test-specific fixtures to be installed in a materials testing machine by a test administrator. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the interrater reliability of test outcomes between two administrators using the same testing facility. Ten prosthetic components (8 feet and 2 pylons) that spanned the range of commercial designs were subjected to all appropriate tests. Tests with scalar outcomes demonstrated high interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (2,1) >/= 0.935), and there was no discrepancy in observation-based outcomes between administrators, suggesting that between-administrator variability may not present a significant source of error. These results support the integration of these mechanical tests for prosthesis classification, which will help enhance objectivity and optimization of the prosthesis-patient matching process for maximizing rehabilitation outcomes.

AN  - 1676097655
AB  - The requirements elicitation captures relevant information to the shaping of software requirements by using several techniques. However, the effectiveness of the process depends on the context in which it occurs. This article aims to reveal the attributes of the context influencing the elicitation process. For this purpose, a systematic and non-systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted in order to determine which are these attributes. The result of this review yielded 118 attributes that were grouped into 27 generic attributes corresponding to 5 factors: the eductor, the informant, the problem domain, the solution domain and the process itself. This study helps to guide future empirical researches on requirements elicitation pointing out possible experimental factors to consider.

T1  - Care and prejudice: moving beyond mistrust in the care relationship with addicted patients
AN  - 1511530496; 24346517
AB  - Social representations of addiction and the resulting stigmatization have been widely described and studied in the literature, but their effects are no less problematic. These representations, which also occur in care settings, generate a climate of distrust which damages the therapeutic relationship, and its ethical quality. This article, combining clinical experience and an ethical stance, offers an original, innovating approach to the existence of distrust in care relationships in the area of addiction. Pragmatic approaches deriving from the human sciences and analytical philosophy provide an invitation to escape from the demanding climate of mistrust, and to take the gamble on trust so as to improve the quality of interactions between protagonists in care. In complementary fashion, a sociology of action can combat the disquiet generated by distrust through a new commitment to innovating forms of action. This "poetic" mode of action is legitimized by the reflection that backs it up, and by its presentation to peers qualified to approve it. Finally, continental moral philosophy underlines the importance of a carefully weighed commitment on the part of caregivers and addicted patients towards promises aiming to support a sincere care relationship, without damaging the therapeutic dynamic or the ethical quality by providing too many safety nets. This reflection is intended to achieve better identification of the clinical and ethical issues raised by mistrust, and inclusion of these aspects in the training of personnel and in care provision planning.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) project, our primary focus of attention has been on text. In this paper, we discuss our recent innovations in finding ways to capture the subjective interpretation of visual information that has in some way been connected with texts. Previous work has focused on test-based semantic differentials, but our current project extends beyond to triads, and beyond text-based difference poles to image-based difference poles. As our case study, we apply the method to illustrated book covers for Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

AN  - 1449791541
AB  - The assessment of research activity according to international standards has contributed to the internationalization of Spanish research. As a result of this evaluation policy, the number of Spanish social science journals present in Journal Citation Reports (JCR) has increased. In this study we have prepared a descriptive analysis of the presence of Spanish journals in the JCR between 2006 and 2010, comparing the data obtained with those achieved by other Hispanic American countries in the same period. We studied the historical evolution, distribution by country, quartiles and thematic areas, and analyzed the evolution of the impact of major journals. Altogether, 52 Spanish journals were identified in the JCR Social Sciences Edition in the year 2010. As for the subject area, 40% correspond to economics and psychology. In the period of study, the number of journals indexed in the JCR has increased by 2500%. Finally, we discuss the assessment of these journals as a sign of quality by national evaluation agencies, and conclude by recalling that the publication in journals indexed in the JCR is an indication mentioned expressly for the Social Sciences.

T1  - DESIGNING WEBSITES AND COMPOSING MUSIC: IDENTIFYING USABILITY CONSTRUCTS AND THEIR NOMOLOGICAL NETWORKS
AN  - 1266226377
AB  - Website usability is reported to have crucial effects on online purchases, but few theoretical models thoroughly examine these effects. In this article, music composition theory is adopted to propose a theoretical model of website usability, based on the belief that composing good music is similar to designing a usable website. Nomological networks between three constructs of music (melody, harmony, and rhythm), cognitive and affective appraisals, and online purchase intention were examined. A field study was conducted to validate the psychometric properties of measurement items and the nomological networks for the proposed model. The study results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully explains a large amount of variance of the effects of website usability on online purchases and thus can be considered as an alternative theoretical model of website usability.

T1  - Application of Business Model Principles to Website Project Management
AN  - 1326757180
AB  - Company website, as a common interface to its diversified web services, is a significant part of customer relationship management and plays the major role in communication with customers. Therefore, the development and maintenance of related content, functionality and qualitative features must be realized in accordance with internal strategy and support overall competitive advantage. To guarantee such closeness, we propose a new integrated approach, merging classic business model with the factors, affecting website performance. Initially the particular business model is decomposed into a set of functionally compact subsystems. Then they are interconnected through website quality factors, performance indicators and environment influencing aspects. Such mapping allows discovering and quantifying considerable analogies between website attributes and specific parts of business model. We believe that the web site, designed as regular business subsystem, contributes more efficiently to the core institutional processes and, consequently, creates higher value for stakeholders.

AB  - A required writing mechanics course for mass communication students was moved online. A case study experiment manipulating the course design was conducted to determine effects on student engagement, learning, and satisfaction. Online designs with greater interactivity capabilities are positively associated with all three outcomes. These desirable results, combined with the online course's cost-effectiveness and other benefits, support using this as one approach to improve student writing readiness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Metcalfe's law and operational, analytical and collaborative CRM-using online business communities for co-creation
AN  - 993084395
AB  - Business Online Communities are fast becoming excellent tools for operational and collaborative Customer Relationship Management (CRM) with co-creation soon gaining pace as a strategic outcome of Collaborative CRM. This research article aims at analyzing the determinants of Individual Network Value (INV), further goes on to develop a framework for calculating Community Network Value and subsequently, empirically identifies individuals who have high INV. By segmenting the consumers, the research study discusses how organizations can identify consumer co-creators. The community value of a network is of great importance to organizations, especially from the CRM, Marketing and Customer Experience standpoint. The study segments consumers using hierarchical cluster analysis into groups to identify consumer co-creators. Greater participation in an online community, backed by greater commitment, online trust and loyalty towards an organization are individual traits that are useful to companies for identifying consumer co-creators for new product development, sharing innovative ideas and consumer evangelism.

T1  - Relative importance of false positives in the selection process
AN  - 1032540773
AB  - This study investigated the role of contextual factors in personnel selection. Specifically, I explored if specific job factors such as the wage, training, available applicant pool and security concerns around a job, influenced personnel decisions. Additionally, I explored if the individual differences of decision makers played a role in how the previously mentioned job factors affected their decisions. A policy-capturing methodology was employed to determine the weight participants place on the job factors when selecting candidates for different jobs. Regression and correlational analyses were computed with the beta weights obtained from individual regression analyses. The results obtained from the two samples (student and general population) revealed that specific job characteristics did indeed influence personnel decisions. Participants were more concerned with making mistakes and thus less likely to accept candidates when selecting candidates for jobs having high salary and/or high training requirements.

T1  - Realism versus simplicity in strategic marketing planning: the impact of temporality
AN  - 900912852
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to get insight into managers' cognitive maps with respect to simplicity, realism and confidence, when talking about strategic marketing planning. Moreover, it analyses the impact of temporal modes of thinking on the three cognitive constructs studied. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research is performed, touching the core of what is really going on in the manager's mind rather than just skimming the surface. Findings - Past and present oriented thinking (often found in deductive and inductive approaches) are found to be more simple but less realistic than an abductive (may be) or even visionary (will be) approach. Moreover, managers seem to integrate elements of various schools of management thought when thinking about simplicity, realism and confidence. Practical implications - Managers use management tools, frames and dimensions in a compound way when developing strategic marketing plans. Originality/value - The paper sheds another light on how various schools of management thought are used in strategic marketing planning practice.

T1  - Understanding the antecedents to public interest and engagement with heritage
AN  - 864090338
AB  - Purpose - Attempts to increase public participation in heritage-related activities have had mixed success. This research seeks to understand the degree to which people value heritage, what influenced their degree of engagement with heritage and what elements of a heritage item impacted upon the value attached to it by the public. Design/methodology/approach - Focus groups and repertory grid analysis were used to gain a sense of how people defined heritage and the factors that influenced their perceptions and involvement. A survey of a nationally representative sample of over 3,200 people was then conducted to empirically test these findings. Findings - The results emphasise that people are highly motivated to engage in heritage activities that they find directly relevant to their own specific interests, culture or history. Heritage was defined broadly, encompassing a wide range of objects, places and experiences, summarised here under 15 categories. The key criteria in determining whether a particular object was viewed as being worthy of heritage protection were its perceived importance to the nation, personal relevance, irreplaceability and uniqueness. Research limitations/implications - The data is limited to the Australian context, and the approach should be replicated in other nations to examine generalisability of results. The complex way in which the public defines heritage means that much work is still to be done to understand how the various attributes of a heritage item interrelate to influence its perceived value. Practical implications - This paper includes implications for heritage managers, specifically on how to educate and support the public connection with heritage by encouraging them to build personal connections through experience, storytelling and celebrations. Originality/value - Through its use of multiple methods of data collection, and inclusion of oft-overlooked groups, this study presents a rare "national" perspective on public views of heritage and how they are formed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 2231322466
AB  - The following exploratory and descriptive studyidentifies a type of cognitive conflict, implicative dilemmas(ID), in patients with Anxiety Disorders (AD). The concept of IDrefers to the fact that symptom loosing, still being desirable, itcould lead to negative consequences for self-identity. Basedon a Constructivist approach and using Kelly's Repertory GridTechnique, this study compared the presence and number of IDsin a sample of 45 patients and in a group of 39 controls. Resultsshowed a significant difference between the presence of IDs inanxious patients (49%) and the control group (25%). If thesedilemmas express psychological conflict and suffering, anxietymight be a symptomatic manifestation. This idea signals theimportance of treating anxious patients not only symptomaticallybut also resolving the cognitive conflicts found. These results areparticularly relevant in developing and planning an efficient andadequate therapeutic focused intervention in function to patientneeds and to their cognitive structures.
El siguiente estudio tiene por objetivo identificar un tipo de conflicto cognitivo, los dilemasimplicativos (DI), en pacientes con Trastorno de Ansiedad (TA). El concepto de DI se refiere a lasimplicaciones positivas y negativas que tiene el síntoma para la persona que lo sufre. La alternativadeseada, es decir, la dirección en la que el cliente quiere ir, tiene implicaciones negativas,por lo cual se resiste al cambio; pudiendo acarrear consecuencias negativas para su sentido deidentidad. Desde un enfoque constructivista y mediante la Técnica de la Rejilla de Kelly, se pretendecomparar la presencia y número de dilemas en una muestra de 45 pacientes y un grupo de39 controles. Los resultados evidencian una diferencia significativa entre la presencia de dilemasen los pacientes ansiosos (49%) y el grupo control (25%). Si los DI implican conflicto psicológicoy sufrimiento, la ansiedad podría ser una expresión sintomática del conflicto y de su intensidad.Ello plantea la necesidad de tratar a los pacientes con TA tanto sintomáticamente como en susconflictos cognitivos. Estos resultados son particularmente relevantes al planificar y desarrollaruna intervención terapéutica que debería ser focalizada, eficiente y adecuada a las necesidades delpaciente y a sus estructuras cognitivas.

T1  - The "family business brand": an enquiry into the construction of the image of family businesses
AN  - 864992365
AB  - Purpose - Family businesses (FBs) play an important role in economies across the world. FBs are consistently associated with specific attributes and expectations, which is something that points towards the notion that FBs can be regarded as a "brand" on their own. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether FBs have actually become a "brand" in the eyes of the wider population. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical investigation is based on the "Personal Construct Theory" (PCT), developed by George R. Kelly. According to this theory, human beings categorise and evaluate the world by building "personal constructs" that reflect their unconscious attitudes and value systems. To find out about the attitudes towards FBs, we used the "Nextexpertizer"® program, which exploits the PCT as a computer-based survey instrument. Finally, these results are connected with two different brand theories: the identity-oriented brand theory of Heribert Meffert and a sociological-based understanding of brands. The study was conducted in two stages: in 2007/2008 the authors interviewed a randomised sample of 80 people across Germany. In 2009 they interviewed 30 people with almost identical socio-demographic characteristics, to assure the comparability of the two surveys. Findings - The analysis of the aforementioned brand theories shows that FBs can be indeed described as a brand on their own. In order to speak of a strong brand, the identity-oriented approach requires the compliance between the intro-perspective and the external-perspective of brands. The perceptions of FBs exhibit a remarkable stability in both surveys. In sum, FBs are perceived as the most sustainable and social type of company. Nevertheless, FBs are also associated with certain negative attributes: for example, middle-size FBs are regarded as particularly inflexible. Originality/value - The study shows that FBs address the identity myths of stability and safety like no other company type. Yet the identity myths also evoke other societal needs, such as egoistic self-fulfillment motives, or the will to live free and without boundaries. For these needs, FBs are perceived as inflexible and stiff.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assess developments in gender and leadership since 1995. The author reflects on how she developed her work as an organisational psychologist during this time and introduces an inclusive model of leadership. Statistics regarding the intransigence in progress in the representation of women means there is little to celebrate. The paper offers suggestions as to how gender bias in leadership can be eliminated or reduced.

T1  - Applying repertory grids technique for knowledge elicitation in quality function deployment
AN  - 751868784
AB  - The repertory grids technique is applied in quality function deployment to elicit the voice of the customers and to derive the importance for each customer requirement from a group of customers. In addition, the repertory grids technique can be used in the relationship matrix to quantify the numerical relationships between customer requirements and technical measures from a group of team members. An integration of the repertory grids technique and quality function deployment would make quality function deployment systematically to gather customer needs for better product or service planning and to determine the relationships between customer requirements and technical measures since the final analyses rely heavily on the results of this relationship matrix. A case illustration is provided to show the usefulness of applying the repertory grids technique in quality function deployment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An overview of Indian research in schizophrenia
AN  - 762299280
AB  - The Indian Journal of Psychiatry published three articles in its first issue way back in 1958. Since then, it has steadily published more than 200 papers on one or the other aspect of schizophrenia. From rudimentary research methodology and descriptive approach, schizophrenia research, as published in the Journal, seems to have come of age with more and more sophisticated research designs and methodologies. Our ardent researchers have made significant contributions in the understanding of this riddle called schizophrenia. Notable contributions have been made in the field of epidemiology, course and outcomes and phenomenology of this disorder. However, research in psycho-social rehabilitation of schizophrenia and related areas is sparse and sporadic. The need to conduct research that impacts health policies and planning of services for this disorder is evident and our researchers would do well to provide impetus in these areas.

T1  - MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
AN  - 751976958
AB  - OVERVIEW: Industrial design is essential for the creation of products that satisfy user needs and aspirations and can be differentiated from the competition. However, most companies fail to reap the full benefits of design. This is often due to cultural and language barriers, between design and other functional areas, and barriers to the introduction of industrial design into new-product development (NPD) process. In this paper we show how designers and NPD managers have different perceptions of "good" design and the ways to achieve it. We also illustrate the challenges in attempting to introduce industrial design into a structured NPD approach. It is by identifying and tackling these issues that managers can exploit the full potential of design, thus making their companies more innovative and competitive. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Exploring Identity within the Recovery Process of People with Serious Mental Illnesses
AN  - 204719325
AB  - To examine self-identity within the recovery processes of people with serious mental illnesses using a repertory grid methodology. Cross-sectional study involving 40 mental health service consumers. Participants rated different "self" and "other" elements on the repertory grid against constructs related to recovery, as well as other recovery focused measures. Perceptions of one's "ideal self" represented more advanced recovery in contrast to perceptions of "a person mentally unwell." Current perceptions of self were most similar to perceptions of "usual self" and least similar to "a person who is mentally unwell." Increased identification with one's "ideal self" reflected increased hopefulness in terms of recovery. The recovery repertory grid shows promise in clinical practice, in terms of exploring identity as a key variable within mental health recovery processes. Distance measures of similarity between various self-elements, including perceptions of others, maps logically against the recovery process of hope.

T1  - Children's impact on innovation decision making: A diary study
AN  - 237029888
AB  - The purpose of the paper is to analyse children's impact on innovation decision making empirically. This paper is a diary study with 14 parents depicting their experiences with regard to the topic of interest over a period of two weeks. Children's influence is stronger in earlier stages of the innovation buying process, based on different communication strategies with differing effects on their parents' purchasing behaviour. This paper helps marketers tailor appropriate marketing and innovation strategies. Special attention is given to the familial dynamics in the innovation decision-making process. This is to prevent inter-family conflicts fuelled by the children's requests. This is one of the first attempts to test Rogers' innovation-decision process. Moreover, despite its many bonuses, the diary method has rarely been applied in the context of familial purchase decision making. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Increasing Entrepreneurial Intentions through Innovations in Pedagogy: European Approaches, Programmes, and Tools
AN  - 192411614
AB  - As a reaction to the positive effects of entrepreneurship, many universities try to enhance students' entrepreneurial mindsets. Based on existing evaluations of entrepreneurship education, this paper focuses on European innovative pedagogy for classroom entrepreneurship. We highlight innovations in entrepreneurial education from seven European countries: Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Poland, and Sweden. Consulting these approaches, the following seams to be particularly crucial: action-/project-based learning, individual and collaborative (team) experiential learning, interdisciplinary grouping, enhancing entrepreneurial skills and knowledge, key qualifications (creativity, autonomy, responsibility, risk-taking), conceptual and informal learning, critical thinking, reflection, meta-cognition, working with innovative ideas, demythologization, learning through "fun", and student-company-university collaboration/networks.

T1  - Barriers to networking for women in a UK professional service
AN  - 213195797
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of personal contact networks in the UK public relations sector, focusing on the barriers to networking identified by practitioners. Empirical research using qualitative methodologies of in-depth interviews and repertory grids conducted with directors, managers and executives in seven UK public relations agencies. UK public relations practitioners in the study may face up to 17 barriers to networking drivers and actions. Three types of barriers emerged-psychological, situational and social. Female practitioners identified all 17 barriers to networking, whereas men identified seven. Research limitations/implications - An insight into the differences in men and women's networking experiences in a growing professional service, especially those negatively influencing their activities. Gender differences are identified and the apparent exclusion from power networks, especially of younger females. UK public relations practitioners may be hindered in the key managerial area of networking, with women perceiving themselves to face more barriers than men. This poses challenges for practitioners to overcome such obstacles, especially for women in this female-dominated industry. Consultancies must consider remedial strategies to counter barriers their employees face, or potentially limit their access to resources and influence which personal networks can bring. The paper is one of the first studies into personal contact networks in the UK public relations industry. It reveals the extent to which both men and women in this professional service face barriers to networking. The paper identifies that women in particular may experience more than twice as many barriers as male counterparts and suggests younger women may be being placed at a disadvantage.

T1  - Kansei engineering toolkit for the packaging industry
AN  - 227577220
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the Kansei engineering toolkit that has been developed to provide a set of tools and techniques to support better packaging design. Design/methodology/approach - The toolkit has its foundations in Kansei engineering but the work has extended the scope and increased reliability of results by: including structured linkages to designers; replacing "highest level Kansei" from Kansei type 1 with brand values; introducing a more structured process for the elicitation of type 2 selection of pack physical properties; reducing the complexity of the semantic differential survey used to elicit consumer perceptions; and structuring a process for selection of the Kansei words. Findings - The work has shown that the proposed toolkit is able to support the design of packaging by illustrating the process with industrial case studies. Research limitations/implications - Kansei engineering and the techniques presented in this toolkit are inevitably simplifications of the real situation, since many more variables affect the consumers purchase decision than is tested in this process. There is still a need to test the insights gained by the toolkit into a wider investigation. Practical implications - This paper offers the packaging industry a robust and repeatable method to develop better packaging. Originality/value - The paper presents an overall description of the Kansei engineering toolkit for packaging design and is a structured process that provides quantitative results for the relationship between branding, consumer perception and design variables.

T1  - The search for mastery: An investigation into creativity as an antecedent to early counselor case conceptualization development
AN  - 304606266
AB  - The search for expertise in counseling practice had led to a broad study of counselor development. Calls for the improvement of counselor training programs by improving understanding of counselor cognitive complexity, along with advances in the psychometric measurement of creativity, provided a new direction in understanding how mental health counselors can be more effectively trained and thus develop greater expertise. Using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, this study investigated the unique contribution creativity provided to the case conceptualization skills of counselor trainees. Creative attitudes open to divergent thinking demonstrated statistically significant predictive power whereas variations in early clinical experience did not. These findings provide a building block for future research in the utility of creativity instruments as a measure of predicting counselor development and expertise. Study limitations, as well as issues in the selection, training, and future research of counselor trainees are discussed.

T1  - The Blue Planet Earth Systems Approach (BEPESA) For The Study Of Water Related Systems
AN  - 2264159737
AB  - This paper calls for an environmentally-oriented program that is based not only on environmental education towards awareness, but a program that helps develop environmental insight and understanding. The Israeli chapter of the IHP and the Israel National Commission for UNESCO present the Blue Planet Earth Systems Approach (BEPESA). The main goal of BEPESA, presented here, is to encourage junior-high school students to develop system-thinking as a basis for environmental literacy. BEPESA is an earth system-based curriculum package focusing on water-related issues in an environmental context. It has been applied and tested in Israel since 2000 in association with cognitive-based research that disclosed unusual positive results. High order thinking skills, such as system thinking skills, can indeed be taught at the junior high-school level, leading to considerable gains in students' reasoning and abilities. Furthermore, students involved in the learning process through knowledge integration activities, scientific inquiry, and with a concrete connection with the outdoor learning environment, achieved meaningful improvement in their systems-thinking skills.

T1  - Measuring the impact of wood species on consumer preferences for wooden furniture by means of the Analytic Hierarchy Process
AN  - 214610505
AB  - While several studies have revealed the existence of substantial differences in consumers' perceptions of various wood species, the impact of these differences on the preference of wood furniture is still unknown. The present paper aims at closing this gap by referring to a recent mail survey that was conducted in Germany, which is one of the most important markets for furniture in the world. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied to measure shifts in the individual preference structure arising in connection with the used hardwood species. We show that the applied wood species has a significant impact on the assessment of various attributes of wood dining tables. Knowing these effects supports the designing of wood furniture that meets consumer expectations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - TRIO /Upward Bound students' construction of vocations using George Kellys Rep -test method
AN  - 304899708
AB  - The Information Age is revolutionizing the way we communicate, acquire knowledge, and perform work. Society is shifting from occupations rooted in industrial production to those associated with knowledge and information, requiring the development of new skills for changing occupations and updating old educational methods.   Educators need to be aware of economic and social changes and have a vision for how to design career education to respond to those changes. Individuals must also be prepared to learn on their own as careers evolve and change. The training necessary to adapt to the changing career culture needs to be made available to everyone, regardless of social class and background.   In order to learn how to help students prepare for life, it is necessary to understand their views on careers. There is a critical and acute need to understand the perceptions of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, such as Upward Bound participants (identified by the U.S. Department of Education as part of the TRIO Program for low-income and first generation college students). This study used Personal Construct Psychology (PCP) to access representations of students' thinking by means of a repertory-test grid methodology. Using the traditional constructivist repertory-test method, a custom designed instrument called the WOAR (Weingarten Occupational Awareness Rep-test) was used by students in a Utah Valley State College Upward Bound group to generate constructs for personally identified occupations. These constructs provided the data for a qualitative content analysis designed to better understand how marginalized students construct careers and the world of work.   The resulting analysis reflected the students' perceptions about (a) what their life experiences were, (b) what they had in common with one another, and (c) what they had in common with the rest of the population at large, in terms of career knowledge. The findings showed that the students were influenced by people they knew such as doctors, teachers, church leaders and so on, as indicated by the career choices they identified. They were also affected by their unique experiences such as identifying drug dealing and other illegal means as a way of earning money. The collective responses identified sixteen common career themes among the students.

T1  - Doctoral students' mental models of a Web search engine: An exploratory study
AN  - 304762255
AB  - This exploratory research investigates the factors that might influence a specific group of users' mental models of a Web search engine, Google, as measured in the dimension of completeness. A modified mental model completeness scale (MMCS) was developed based on Borgman's, Dimitroff s, and Saxon's models, encompassing the perception of (1) the nature of the Web search engine, (2) searching features of the Web search engine, and (3) the interaction between the searcher and the Web search engine. With this scale, a participant's mental model completeness level was determined by how many components of the first two parts of the scale were described and which level of interaction between the participant and Google was revealed during the searches. The choice of the factors was based on the previous studies on individual differences among information seekers, including user's search experience, cognitive style, learning style, technical aptitudes, training received, discipline, and gender.    Sixteen Ph.D. students whose first language is English participated in the research. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to determine the students' mental model completeness level (MMCL) as well as their search experience, training received, discipline and gender. Direct observation technique was employed to observe students' actual interactions with Google. Standard tests were administered to determine the students' cognitive styles, learning styles and technical aptitudes.    The results show that doctoral students can be differentiated in the dimension of completeness of their mental models. While these students have a relatively complete mental model of many features of Google, they have a relatively poor understanding of its technical aspects, in particular how it indexes and ranks the web pages. Among the factors that were studied, only cognitive style correlated with the MMCL score. That is, the more field independent a doctoral student is, the more complete his/her mental model may be of Google. The results show that the interactivity level between doctoral students and Google (often revealed through their actual searches) can be the manifestation of their perception of the nature and search features of Google. This finding supports earlier research that user behaviour or performance is guided by the user's mental models.

T1  - The Dynamic Organic Transformational (D.O.T.) team model for high-performance knowledge-worker teams
AN  - 217109123
AB  - This paper aims to explain the dynamics of the five dimensional Dynamic Organic Transformational (D.O.T.) Team Model for knowledge-workers to use in achieving high performance. The D.O.T. Team Model is a dynamic team model developed to integrate and expand key concepts from open systems - contingency and dynamic congruence, transformational leadership, and learning organizations. The five dimensions of the D.O.T. Team Model consist of purpose, people, partnerships, process, and performance. The D.O.T. Team Model is most applicable where subjective measures are used for high performing teams. This model transcends the existing team performance theory and provides a basis for future researchers to build onto the continuing evolutionary changes in team performance. The D.O.T. Team Model is a comprehensive and holistic approach for knowledge-workers to achieve high performance. This model is grounded in theory and by applying the five dimensions (purpose, people, partnerships, process, and performance) this model enables optimum fit  with a high-performance team's organization and environments - allowing knowledge-worker members to effectively respond to dynamic changes and enhance its team and organizational performance.

T1  - A Proposed Method for Developing a Team Performance Measurement System
AN  - 192452879
AB  - Many theories involving effective team performance have been popularized in the literature. Several of these theories have suggested measurement techniques for evaluation of teams. Some of these performance measurement systems measure individual's contributions such as skills, attitudes, and output but often the way they measure individuals is counter-productive to the team-process effort. In reality, a contradiction may exist between metrics for individuals and actual team performance. Measuring the performance of the team as a whole provides information to help with training, coaching, and rewarding. This paper will provide details of a suggested system for measuring team performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Natural Materiality – The People’s Choice
AN  - 2264245952
AB  - Despite the variety of toolkits, life cycle analysis, models, and other forms of guidance on sustainable resource use in architecture, the amount of energy used and waste created in the industry is going up on a global basis. The conventional approach to promoting sustainable specification clearly isn’t working. This paper offers a new approach based on a recent qualitative case study of people’s attitudes, associations and understanding of key construction materials in housing. The findings suggest that people have a deep tacit knowledge of materiality which draws on the ecological \“affordances” offered by materials and are very clear about which materials they want, where, and why. These affordances, identified in Gibson’s theory of ecological perception, transcend the usual subject/object divide and challenge designers to do likewise. This tacit knowledge appears uniquely related to people’s place of upbringing as well as their occupation. It supports the notion that a bioregional approach should be adopted for material and product specification which empowers users to take more responsibility for the materiality of the buildings they live and work in. The emotional \“endearment” of materiality in architecture to the users is argued as a key factor in potentially reducing maintenance costs and subsequent resource impacts. Currently, architecture is conceived primarily as the design of space using construction resources. Reframing architecture as the design of resource use in place, draws on users’ local knowledge and an implaced, more natural materiality. Design and research are thus challenged to focus on a more limited palette of materials, based on the findings of the study, and work to the edge of technology in developing building elements related to these. This way of working can then be closely linked into the eco-systemic processes which underlie any sustainable design endeavour that aims to harmonise with nature.

T1  - Review of supply chain management and logistics research
AN  - 232593259
AB  - The purpose of the paper is to examine the state of logistics and supply chain management (SCM) research in the last five years from the standpoint of existing methodologies. The state of research is assessed by examining the research design, number of hypothesis testing, research methods, data analysis techniques, data sources, level of analysis and country of authors. The review of SCM and logistics research is based on 442 papers published from 1999 to 2003 in the following three academic journals: 1. Journal of Business Logistics, 2. International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, and 3. Supply Chain Management: An International Journal. Major findings show that there is an increase in the direct observation methods like case studies. In general, the research is more interpretative in nature. Survey method is still holding the highest position. More advanced techniques are being used for data analysis in empirical studies and there has been an increase in hypothesis testing. The trend in survey research is moving from exploratory to model building and testing.

T1  - A method for performance briefing at the project inception stage
AN  - 219636139
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this article is to create a strategically positioned client performance brief with a clear and workable statement of the project requirements specified by a representative group of stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - The application describes the relocation of a library with community facilities with a local council. This action research study of the project inception stages used the process of strategic needs analysis (SNA). This approach uses a workshop setting involving stakeholders in identifying a range of strategic options for the project problem. The development of a range of realistic options was aided by the use of a problem- structuring computer program, Situation Structuring. Individual workshop participants then expressed their preferences for the final options using a second software package (Strategizer) and after a short period for analysis the results were presented to a second workshop for discussion. The performance brief was then prepared to reflect stakeholders' and the workshop's preferences. Findings - The process involved is described with the development and selection of organizational strategic options with the council stakeholders. The creation and identification of user performance indicators to guide the design development process is illustrated and a sample from the final performance brief is provided. The project is nearing completion and the local Council considers the process has been a success. Research limitations/implications - The process described has been developed over six studies in varying client environments in Australia. Further studies are needed in client organisations with a rolling program of capital works to test the robustness of the approach described. Practical implications - This work can assist the facilities manager to play an important role in the development of the initial performance-based brief during the project inception stage that can assist clients and guide the design team. Originality/value - Establishing client needs during the formative stages of a project (before design commences) is becoming an increasingly important role for the facilities manager. This work presents a description of a process that provides the means for clients and facilities managers to ensure that their strategic needs are met within the defined project.

T1  - Parental coping with sudden infant death after donor insemination: case report
AN  - 211897861; 15665018
AB  - We report the case of an artificial donor insemination couple experiencing sudden infant death of their 8-month-old child. Six months after the incident, the couple were investigated by means of an extensive interview, a repertory grid investigation and the Family Assessment Measure, as well as at 6 years after the incident by an extensive interview. The results show the importance of the diagnosis of male infertility and the preceding fertility treatment for coping with the death of their child. Six months after the incident, acute feelings associated with bereavement are mixed with feelings of anger and shame, apparently due to the experience of infertility. However, secrecy and shame associated with male infertility and donor insemination make it impossible for the couple to communicate their feelings to each other or to friends and relatives; furthermore, they decline psychological counselling. Repertory grid investigation and the Family Assessment Measure point to significant problems within the partnership. Six years after the incident, the couple's relationship is destabilized and both partners plan to divorce. We suggest a possible link between donor insemination secrecy and difficulties with coping. We discuss implications for couple counselling and emphasize the necessity for an improved legal framework for donor insemination in Germany.

T1  - Researching literacy as tool, place, and way of being
AN  - 212137912
AB  - Research at this intermediate level of analysis between system (activity theory) and instant (phenomenology) can reveal important characteristics of learning at the level of both the group (changes in shared practice, knowledge, tool or artifact use) and the individual (a person's "process of coming to be, of forging identities in activity," Lave, 1988).  For, in a massively networked society like in the United States, with such ferocious capacity for enabling both the global to be localized (e.g., the rewriting of the animé series Card Captor Sakura from Japan into local terms of teen pregnancy by a 14-year-old girl coming of age in Utah) and the local to be globalized (e.g., the editing, rescoring, and widespread distribution of the illicitly Web-posted Star Wars Kid video, originally a recording that an adolescent boy clandestinely made of himself while horsing around at school with an 8mm camera, a Jedi fantasy, and a golf club), it becomes less and less viable to presume meaning as a stable, countable construct that can be categorized, catalogued, and quantified.

T1  - Disease adaptation may have decreased quality-of-life responsiveness in patients with chronic progressive neurological disorders
AN  - 1033168840; 15528054
AB  - We hypothesized that disease adaptation could be measured in chronic progressive neurological disorders (CPND) through paired longitudinal comparisons of quality of life (QOL) and health status (HS) and of the mental health (MH) and physical health (PH) domains of QOL instruments.

              
We identified 193 quantitative studies of QOL and HS in a systematic review of episodic (END) and chronic progressive (CPND) neurological disorders. Effect size or other responsiveness measures were analyzed in 31 studies that included paired longitudinal comparisons of QOL-HS, MH-PH, or both. Responsiveness means were compared using the paired-sample 
t -test or sign test.

              
In 12 paired comparisons, QOL responsiveness was significantly lower than HS (P =.05, sign test). In 53 paired MH-PH effect-size comparisons, MH responsiveness was lower than PH (P =.02, t =2.48, paired sample). Significantly lower MH responsiveness was observed in 28 paired CPND comparisons (P  < .01, t =3.86, paired sample) but not in 25 paired END comparisons (P =.50, t =0.68, paired sample).

              
Lower responsiveness of QOL in CPND may be related to disease adaptation. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings and to investigate the importance of disease adaptation in the evaluation of neurological disease and in health resource allocation.

T1  - How university students view online study: a PCP perspective
AN  - 218052444
AB  - With the ever-increasing impact of information technology (IT) on society, universities are pushed to deliver the courses through the Internet by the format of Web course or online study. There are relatively few studies of how students construe this new mode of delivery and study. This study aimed to better understanding of how students construe the online learning with the framework of personal construct psychology. A total of 41 students participated in the study, generating more than 500 elements regarding the online versus traditional learning mode. The grid analysis results in terms of students' construct are reported in this paper. The implications of understanding and facilitating the "match" between the institutional drive for online delivery and students' constructs are discussed in the context of online learning.

T1  - Performance Assessment of Public Sector Scientists
AN  - 205231149
AB  - Publicly-funded scientific research establishments are complex organizations requiring considerable management skills to optimize performance. This article identifies the performance indicators (PIs) used in the appraisal of public sector science in the UK and assesses their relevance in relation to the Balanced Score Card (BSC) management tool. The author found that current PIs in UK science relate primarily to scientific peer-group interests and are unlikely, on their own, to facilitate the optimization of organizational management. The article also suggests the concentration on these PIs could hinder the implementation of government science policies, for example public understanding of science, and wealth creation.

T1  - Data analytic trends and training in strategic management
AN  - 225006213
AB  - Data analysis is a key element of the research process. Accordingly, appropriate doctoral training in data analysis is  vital to the strategic management field's future. We used a two-study design to evaluate quantitative data analysis  trends and doctoral training. An analysis of Strategic Management Journal articles from 1980 to 2001 reveals that,  contrary to some predictions, the use of general linear model techniques such as regression has increased over  time. However, the use of more specialized techniques, including those suitable for examining longitudinal data,  discrete events, and causal structure, has also grown substantially. A survey of recent doctoral graduates shows  that, although skilled with general linear models, many are ill prepared to use specialized techniques. Based on our  findings, we offer suggestions aimed at bridging gaps between what doctoral students (and other researchers) know  and what they need to know about data analysis.

T1  - Career counselors confront a critical crossroad: A vision of the future
AN  - 219446072
AB  - The current challenges confronting career counselors require increased discourse regarding career counseling models. Some authors have initiated this discourse, but more participants are needed. The need also exists to communicate more aggressively the special expertise that career counselors bring to their work. As career counselors construct contemporary intervention models, they will need to engage in action research to demonstrate accountability and to document that their services are effective. Career counselors can embrace these activities by building on past practices to construct a vision for the future. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using ZMET to explore barriers to the adoption of 3G mobile banking services
AN  - 210934308
AB  - Telecommunications companies world-wide are developing 3G mobile phones and applications. In the UK, mobile banking is considered to be one of the most value-added and important mobile services available. However, the adoption rate of using 3G mobile phones for financial services is yet to be determined. The current research examined both innovative attributes and customers' perceived risk in order to understand customers' behaviour and motivation toward this innovation. It has advanced the theoretical frameworks of innovation and customers' risk perception as new attributes and risk dimensions were identified. The findings provide banking executives with a better understanding of what are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of 3G mobile banking services, helping them to plan marketing strategies and promotion approaches for 3G mobile banking services in the future.

T1  - Managing processes through teamwork
AN  - 220295415
AB  - Efficient teamwork has been shown to be a key element for improving business process performance and, as a consequence, organizational performance. As a result of this, improving management and measurement of team performance has captured the interest of many organizations intending to increase their competitiveness. This paper illustrates some of the research findings of an on-going collaborative research project. It first introduces the idea behind a framework for managing process team performance and later compares this framework with the work that an EFQM winning organization (2000 European Quality Award prize winner) carried out in order to re-engineer its organization towards a structure based on processes and teams.

T1  - Who will look after my grandmother?
AN  - 204191104; 11820529
AB  - A review of the literature illustrates the unpopularity of nursing in the elderly population related to other areas of nursing practice. The aim of this article is to present the findings of a research project conducted in Victoria, Australia, investigating the career preferences of undergraduate nursing students. The results indicate caring for older adults is considered the least popular area of practice for Year 1 nursing students. The reason given by students for their choices demonstrates a negative view of this type of work, largely based on inaccuracies and misconceptions. The implications of these findings for the future care of elderly individuals are discussed.

T1  - Perceived salesperson service attributes and retail patronage intentions
AN  - 210902272
AB  - In the 1990s many companies have acknowledged the critical importance of being customer-oriented. However, as retailers contemplate the higher costs and higher revenues of increased customer service levels, they need to understand the relative importance to consumers of various aspects of customer service, particularly those delivered by salespeople. This research investigates the impact of selected salesperson service attributes and levels on consumer patronage intentions in a consumer electronics store setting. The study uses conjoint analysis to measure consumer priorities. The results indicate that salesperson's respect for the customer, knowledge, and responsiveness are the most important attributes. Where three service levels are presented, there is a greater difference in impact between the lowest and middle levels than between the middle and highest levels. This suggests that retailers do not necessarily have to offer the best service levels to satisfy customers, but must avoid poor service levels.

T1  - Organizational Performance: The Future Focus of Leadership Development Programs
AN  - 2185658445
AB  - Executive Summary This article analyzes 54 studies on leadership development research from 1984 — 2000 and determines the extent to which the intended outcomes of those leadership development programs focus on organizational performance, taking Burke and Day's (1986) meta-analysis as its starting point. Burke and Day's analysis, commonly regarded as the principle empirical support for the evaluation of the effectiveness of managerial training, found mixed results on the effectiveness of programs with only 2 out of 70 studies having organizational performance as the explicit outcome. This research confirms that from a sample of available studies organizations have begun to take a more systemic approach to leadership development, as 16 of the studies analyzed focus on organizational performance as the outcome of the leadership development experience. However, results on evaluations of effectiveness of the leadership development programs continue to be mixed.

T1  - The ZMET alternative
AN  - 202675189
AB  - Many of today's marketing research techniques rely on verbal communication as a data-collection method. Yet the consensus among communication specialists is that more than 80% of all human communication is nonverbal. Cognitive scientists acknowledge that human beings think in images, not in words. Sociolinguists also recognize that most communication is nonverbal. The implication of these findings for the marketing research field is that a disjunction exists between how consumers think and communicate and the marketing methods used to elicit and explicate this information. Therefore, combining nonverbal images with verbal communication creates a more meaningful message than relying on verbal communication alone.

T1  - Senior managers' perceptions of the competencies they require for effective performance: implications for training and development
AN  - 214802498
AB  - This study investigates whether there is a set of universal senior management competencies in the context of one large multi-site service organization. Four distinct work environments are identified and different lists of competencies are perceived to be important by managers working at the same grade (unit general manager or equivalent) in each of these environments. These findings are considered within the context of the debate about the utility of competency lists for management development.

T1  - Improving teaching in higher education: Student and teacher perspectives
AN  - 209729093
AB  - Using a phenomenological approach, the study sets out to discover whether it can derive a concept of good teaching from a group of university lecturers and the extent to which it compares and contrasts with a corresponding student concept of good teaching. The subjects were all mature adults, usually postgraduate, and often practising professionals with a wide experience of the university system.

T1  - Team role balance and team performance: an empirical study
AN  - 216349522
AB  - Accompanying the growing use of teams in the workplace, Belbin's diagnostic instrument for team role self-perception is now widely used for a variety of practical management development purposes, including putting together "balanced" teams. Despite the claims of some purists that Belbin's instrument lacks a strong theoretical underpinning, it fills an apparent void in practical teamworking literature, even though its applicability is not well understood. This study uses data from 43 teams of MBA students performing a project management simulation exercise, and finds no significant relationship between team role balance and team performance. Nevertheless, the study shows that the presence or absence of some individual roles can have a positive or negative effect on performance.

T1  - Building a foundation for effective teaching and learning of English: A personal perspective on thirty years of research
AN  - 215352210
AB  - In it, I frame the evolution of my own work and use my work over time as a mirror of a variety of features within the field as a whole.

Since my first professional writing was published in 1966 (Corbin & Applebee, 1966), I can call it a 30+ year retrospective on the evolution of a researcher and of a field.

In the middle 1970s I became involved as a consultant to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).

Since 1981, I have been coauthor of some 14 reports on student achievement in reading, writing, and literature, often as first author because my surname begins with A. The first of these was Reading, Thinking, and Writing (Applebee, Barrow, Brown, Cooper, Mullis, & Petrosky, 1981); the most recent, the NAEP 1992 Writing Report Card (Applebee, Langer, Mullis, Latham, & Gentile, 1994).

[...]it moves away from the artificial separation of the language arts, creating a context in which writing, reading, viewing, and discussion are naturally integrated with one another.

[...]it places the teacher at the center of learning rather than at the periphery, as the person who mediates between the conversation of the classroom and that of the larger tradition of discourse of which it is a part.

T1  - Repressive coping and self-reports of parenting
AN  - 218652809; 10212738
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether women who possess a repressive coping style (repressors) self-report more positive judgments of their childhood on questionnaire and repertory grid measures compared with non-repressors. DESIGN: Repressors (low anxiety-high defensiveness) were compared with a composite group of non-repressors, containing some low anxious (low anxiety-low defensiveness), some high anxious (high anxiety-low defensiveness), some defensive high anxious (high anxiety-high defensiveness) and some non-extreme scorers. METHODS: Participants completed the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI; Parker, Tupling & Brown, 1979) and a 10 x 10 repertory grid, Self-Identification Form. RESULTS: On the PBI, repressors scored significantly higher than non-repressors on paternal care and significantly lower on paternal overprotection. There were no group differences for maternal measures. On the repertory grid, repressors compared with non-repressors perceived (a) themselves as significantly closer to their father, a woman they like, and their ideal partner, and significantly further from a woman they dislike, and a man they dislike; and (b) their father as significantly closer to a woman they like, a partner/person they admire, and an ideal partner. In addition, repressors were significantly tighter on construing than non-repressors. CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the hypothesis that repressors would rate their interactions with their fathers more positively than non-repressors when allowed to do so on self-report measures.

T1  - Body image and HIV: Implications for support and care
AN  - 201404883; 98416380; 03816185
AB  - Very little formal research has looked at body image change over the course of HIV illness or assessed the implications of changes for support interactions. There are three main spheres of influence on body image: the physical, psychological and the social. HIV shares some of these aspects with other chronic or fatal illnesses, but has specific elements which are distinctive, such as particular physical manifestations and the negative impact of media, social representations and stigma resulting in a radically altered experience for an HIV-positive body. This paper outlines preliminary findings using a body image measure designed specifically for use in HIV. The results suggest that people with HIV may experience significant feelings of contamination, brought about through internalization of stigma and representations, in addition to physical decline as illness progresses.

T1  - Evaluative images and tourism: The use of personal constructs to describe the structure of destination images
AN  - 217444938; 01645688
AB  - Prior research at the regional scale suggests that 2 components underlie people's evaluations of tourist destinations: arousing-sleepy and pleasant-unpleasant.  A study was undertaken to see if these dimensions also apply at the international and local levels.  Although their relevance to the local level seemed to be masked by individuals' personal experiences and knowledge, their applicability at the international scale supports the existence of an underlying general schema in environmental evaluation.

T1  - The learning organisation in small and medium-sized enterprises A destination or a journey?
AN  - 212146771
AB  - As the rate of change and uncertainty in the environment in which UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operate continues to accelerate, so too do the demands on all the members of the organisation to respond more rapidly to market demand, while at the same time being continually under pressure to improve the quality of the company's product or service. Indeed, the notion of organisational effectiveness is increasingly becoming associated with stakeholder, rather than merely shareholder satisfaction. Choueke raises questions that would need to be addressed in order to convince SME owners that power sharing in the organization through widening questioning and reflection would be beneficial to the business: (1) If the learning organization model is so effective in terms of business performance, why isn't it more widely used? (2) Why do entrepreneurs find it difficult to share power? (3) How can we implement a learning model in a practical context when the concept of the learning organization is so difficult to tie down? (4) Isn't extending effective marketing effort in the organization going to produce improved profits, not extending learning?

AB  - The applicability of Russel and his colleagues' proposed affective space structure to large-scale environments (i.e., tourism destination countries) as well as its potential as a positioning structure to study affective images of tourism destinations is examined.  The multidimensional scaling analysis of 11 Mediterranean countries along with proposed affective space structure indicated that Russel and his colleagues' proposed affective space can also be applied to places that are not perceived directly.  It also showed potential for studying the affective image positioning of tourism destinations.  Some theoretical and practical implications and future research areas regarding tourism destination images are discussed.

T1  - Management assessment centres as a focus for change
AN  - 214817066; 00660905
AB  - Assessment center technology was originally developed in order to select among applicants for management jobs and to assess long-term potential.  Now, there is an emphasis on the diganosis of participant training and development needs.  A case is examined in which an assessment center program has played a key role in the process of organizational change.  The organization that introduced the program was the social services department of a county council in the UK.  The response to the government's Care in the Community initiatives in this department focused on the redesign of the team manager's role.  A set of competence criteria was developed using fairly standard assessment center methodology.  By focusing on their skills, individuals were also forced to focus on the organizational change.  The use of an assessment center communicates the message that the organization is concerned about management skills and has preferences about management style.

T1  - Improving Assessment Centres
AN  - 202756661; 00558126
AB  - Evidence from the vast majority of more than 50 validation studies indicates that assessment center (AC) exercises predict future performance or success very well.  However, there are a substantial number of design shortcomings associated with ACs that occur quite frequently.  One shortcoming is an inadequate specification of the target competencies against which participants are assessed.  Often these are loosely defined in nonbehavioral terms and overlap each other.  To achieve a successful appraisal, it is important to: 1.  use a designer with proven expertise, 2.  ensure that senior management are committed to the success of the process over the long term, 3.  select assessors who have a good track record in staff assessment and development, 4.  train these assessors thoroughly and monitor their subsequent performance, 5.  carry out a systematic analysis of jobs at the target level for which one is assessing potential, and 6.  monitor results over the long-term and make any necessary changes.

T1  - Construing the Business Portfolio: A Cognitive Model of Diversification
AN  - 194219336; 00465957
AB  - Researchers investigating the relationship between diversification and performance have been generally inattentive to the dominant general management logics that corporate-level managers use to understand and manage strategy diversity.  In response to this, the use of the repertory grid is proposed.  The grid is a methodology adapted from the work of Kelly (1955) and other personal construct theorists.  As an approach to operationalizing the mental maps that direct the management of strategic diversity, the business repertory grid appears to have several important advantages.  It is particularly useful in assessing the ways in which top managers construe the corporate portfolio and manage strategic diversity.  Grid technique is flexible, efficient, and systematic.  It is also highly reproducible, thus allowing researchers to validate or challenge the results of previous studies.  A main goal of the application of the repertory grid to the study of strategic diversity is to measure the way in which top managers perceive relationships among businesses in their firms.

AB  - Recent surveys in the United Kingdom have shown that attitudes to work have undergone marked changes (Employment Gazette, February 1984). In the light of current levels of unemployment and trends towards early retirement, part-time work, job sharing, shorter working weeks and intermittent employment, it is important that we try to understand what work means to people and the changing place of paid employment in their lives.

AN  - 848876287
AB  - "Personal construct psychology," authored by the late Professor George A. Kelly in 1955, has been described as a theory ahead of its time. The theory certainly did not "catch on" rapidly within American psychology. However, the theory has developed, first in Great Britain and Western Europe. More recently, American psychologists have found its challenge. The story of how construct psychology has slowly attained greater visibility is told by Professor Landfield, a former student of George A. Kelly.
