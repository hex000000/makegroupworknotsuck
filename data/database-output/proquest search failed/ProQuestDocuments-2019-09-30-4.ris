T1  - Perceptions of Socially Disadvantaged Children: A Personal Construct Approach
AN  - 2280241950
AB  - The current study compares the perceptions of self, family, and the world of runaway, abandoned, and home-living children using a personal construct approach. The sample consisted of 28 institutionalized runaway children (22 boys and six girls), 40 abandoned children (20 boys and 20 girls), and 50 home-living children (25 boys and 25 girls). The research tools included a semistructured demographic interview, a sentence completion test, and repertory grid technique. Results indicated that runaway children perceived their fathers as more rejecting and unloving as compared to abandoned and home-living children. Friends were construed positively by runaway children as opposed to home-living and abandoned children. On the domain of self, it was found that all the three groups were confused and unsure of their self-concept. Results of the study indicate that runaway children experience a substantial degree of pull toward the external world or other people, and the family was found to be pushing the child into the world of the unknown.

T1  - What traits do academics value in student writing? Insights from a psychometric approach
AN  - 2182185339
AB  - The number of students studying for university qualifications through the medium of English and for whom English is not their first language has increased significantly in recent years. This, along with efforts to widen access to those under-represented in higher education, has brought into focus the question of what academics see as constituting a 'good' piece of student writing. In this small-scale pilot study, Thurstone's method of paired comparisons was used to establish a scale for ranking six essays in terms of how favourably each was viewed by academic lecturers when compared with every other essay in the set. Kelly's repertory grid technique was subsequently applied to interviews conducted with the same lecturers to establish which traits they associated with the upper and lower end of the scale. Findings suggest that this methodology represents a promising approach to establishing what academic tutors regard as the key elements of good writing and thus provides an indication of what English teachers might fruitfully focus on in their teaching of the skill.

T1  - On the Relation Between Subjective Importance and Elicitation Order of Constructs
AN  - 2193681614
AB  - The subjective importance of constructs elicited with the repertory grid technique (RGT) has been conjectured to depend on elicitation order. Constructs elicited early in an interview are assumed to be subjectively more important than later ones. For the RGT, this conjecture is based on only one empirical study with a small sample size using person role titles as elements. This study has not been replicated or tested for other domains. The research for other elicitation techniques shows that the conjecture does not always hold true for nonperson domains. To assess if the order importance relation can be replicated for person and nonperson domains, we conducted two RGT studies with different designs (German study, triadic, nonperson elements, N = 60; Spanish study, dyadic, person elements, N = 61). Construct importance was assessed using importance rankings and ratings. We found no relation between the order of elicitation and importance for the nonperson elements and only a small significant relation using persons as elements. The results indicate that the conjecture should be treated with caution, as it may be weaker than previously assumed for the personal domain and not generalizable to other domains.

T1  - MALTREATMENT AND SELF-RECONSTRUCTION IN CONSTRUCTIVIST THERAPY FOR FIBROMYALGIA / MALTRATO Y RECONSTRUCCIÓN DE LA IDENTIDAD EN LA PSICOTERAPIA CONSTRUCTIVISTA DE LA FIBROMIALGIA
AN  - 2228855487
AB  - Interest in psychological treatments in Fibromyalgia (FM) has increased lately. Little evidences are available about whether having experienced maltreatment affects psychotherapy outcome. Our aim is to investigate the effect of maltreatment on outcome during constructivist therapy in FM. 20 women were assessed before and after therapy using Repertory Grid Technique and clinical measures of which 13 had suffered maltreatment. Those with a history of maltreatment had higher levels of symptoms and a negative construction of others at pre-treatment assessment in comparison to those with no report of maltreatment. After therapy, only those who had been maltreated reduced symptoms and achieved a more integrated construction of others. Maltreatment seemed to affect differently the outcome in constructivist therapy in FM.
Recientemente ha crecido el interés de los tratamientos psicológicos en Fibromialgia (FM). Hay pocas evidencias de cómo el maltrato afecta al proceso psicoterapéutico. El objetivo es investigar si el maltrato afecta de manera diferencial al desarrollo de una terapia constructivista. 20 mujeres con FM fueron evaluadas antes y después de la terapia utilizando la Técnica de Rejilla y otras medidas clínicas. Las 13 pacientes que habían sufrido maltrato presentaban antes del tratamiento mayor severidad de síntomas y una construcción más negativa de los otros. Después de la terapia, este grupo reduce los síntomas de manera significativa y se ven más similares a los otros. La historia de maltrato parece ser un factor relevante en la terapia constructivista en fibromialgia.

T1  - Swedish PE teachers struggle with assessment in a criterion-referenced grading system
AN  - 2015503905
AB  - In the field of education, the international trend is to turn to criterion-referenced grading in the hope of achieving accountable and consistent grades. Despite a national criterion-referenced grading system emphasising knowledge as the only base for grading, Swedish physical education (PE) grades have been shown to value non-knowledge factors, such as students' characteristics and behaviour. In 2011, a new national curriculum was implemented which attempts to deal with the problem by prescribing specific knowledge requirements with a clear progression as the only basis for different grades. The aim of the present study is to explore the impact of the new knowledge requirements on what teachers consider important when assigning grades. It is also to discuss what non-knowledge-related aspects (if any) teachers continue to look for and why these seem to remain resilient to the reform. The Repertory Grid technique was employed to interview the teachers before (2009) and after the implementation (2013). During the interviews, the grading of 45 students was discussed, which generated 125 constructs. After the implementation, there was a near doubling of knowledge constructs, half as many motivation constructs and an almost total elimination of constructs based on confidence and social skills. While motivational factors were still considered valuable for the award of a higher grade, clear criteria seemed to be important, but too limited for the teachers' needs. In order to understand the persistence of motivational factors, we discuss the results in relation to Bernstein's interrelated message systems of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. We emphasise the need to discuss how valid grades can be achieved and, at the same time, give value to the regulative discourse in order to realise the overarching national goals of values and norms in education and PE.

T1  - Assessing Personal Constructs of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Person-Centered Measure of Social Cognition
AN  - 1999922949
AB  - Many protocols assessing social communication skills of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are based on behavioral observations. It has been suggested, however, that social cognition encompasses processes underlying observable behaviors. Such processes include personal constructs, which can be assessed using repertory grids. Personal constructs of five adolescents with ASD with average or above average intelligence and receptive and expressive language skills were explored using repertory grids in this study. With visual structure and verbal scaffolding, all participants successfully engaged in the repertory grid process. Data suggest participants had well organized, complex construct systems, a significant understanding of social roles, and were interested in social interactions. Repertory grids may provide additional person-centered information for assessing social communication skills in ASD.

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) are developed to help experts in making decisions; however, these systems tend to go out of date quickly due to changing needs of the users or simply because these systems are not user centred. The users' mental model which reflects their view of the system is considered to be a major starting point for system evaluation and upgrade. The users' thought processes of how users' interact with the system is a major point in understanding the processes or the navigational paths users' undergo in achieving the goal of using the system. This is considered to be a major starting point for system evaluation and upgrade. This research examines the elicitation of users' mental models using Galatea Risk and Safety Tool (GRiST); a web based mental health decision support system. This is to gain a better understanding of how the system is used in the workplace and to identify usability issues resulting from any mismatch or gap between the conceptual model of the system and the mental model of the users which may infer decision making of the system. A novel framework that aims to mine users' perspectives of the system is proposed. The framework further explores the data gotten to help in the system evaluation and re-design. The methodology used involve the process of monitoring users' interactions, mining the data, con-structing mental models using repertory grid technique and concept mapping to understand users' understanding of the system and to analyse the findings in investigating and resolving usability and system's functionalities issues.

In context-aware ubiquitous learning environments, navigation support mechanisms are essential to prevent learners lost in the learning space and to improve their learning efficacy.}} textbf{{Many navigation mechanisms have been proposed to deal with this concern. However, when they plan the navigation route for learners, most of them consider only the learning environment and the learning objective. Little study takes the knowledge relationship among learning targets into considerations. Many researches of cognitive development theory have been indicated that the learning efficacy can be improved when the learning sequence follows the knowledge relationship among the learning materials. It is worth to study if the learners will perform better when they learn in a u-learning environment following the sequence of knowledge relationship. In this paper, a navigation support mechanism considering the knowledge relationship among learning targets for context-aware u-learning is proposed. The repertory grid technique is used to analyze the knowledge relationship among learning targets for the new proposed navigation mechanism. To verify the effectiveness of the new proposed navigation mechanisms, a context-aware ulearning system with the new proposed navigation support mechanism is developed. Field experiments are also performed to verify the efficacy of the new proposed mechanism.

Quality of sound source separation algorithms has traditionally been evaluated based on a set of established quality metrics: target distortion, interference from other sources, artifacts distortion, and a measure of overall separation quality. In our previous work, listening test results were presented where no significant correlation between these quality metrics and perceptual ratings from the listening test could be observed. Following these results, we now attempt to better understand perceptual quality in a sound source separation context. We focus on determining how separation quality is actually defined by listeners and propose the use of a descriptive methodology to reveal its most relevant dimensions. A combination of Free-Choice Profiling and Repertory Grid Technique is used with 10 human listeners in an attempt to verify if the main dimensions of separation quality truly correspond to those established by the quality metrics. The outcomes of this exploration bring light to the development of new methodologies for sound separation quality evaluation, and suggest a two-dimensional perceptual space for quality of sound source separation.

T1  - The Self Between Cacophony and Monologue: A Conceptualization and Empirical Examination of Dialogical Complexity
AN  - 1892266267
AB  - Theory of dialogical self distinguishes between cacophonous, monological, and dialogical structure of the self. So far these structures have not been examined within systematic quantitative studies. Focusing on this issue, we conceptualized the three structures as degrees on a dimension of dialogical complexity. To assess dialogical complexity, we proposed a numerical index derived from the personal position repertoire and examined it empirically. We compared the index of dialogical complexity with indices of cognitive complexity (derived from the repertory grid technique), integrative complexity, and presence of dialogical relationships in narratives (both derived from the thematic apperception test). In our sample of a total of 60 nonclinical respondents, the index of dialogical complexity was not correlated with cognitive complexity. It was weakly negatively but significantly correlated with integrative complexity. Respondents who yielded a higher score of dialogical relationships in narratives formed the dialogical structure of the self according to the dialogical complexity index. Respondents who yielded less dialogical relationships in narratives obtained a wider range of dialogical complexity scores that indicated more cacophonous or monological structures. We conclude that the relationships with integrative complexity and with presence of dialogical relationships in narratives support the original conceptualization of dialogical complexity. However, due to limitations of the study, the results are not decisive, and further examination of dialogical complexity including clinical samples is needed.

T1  - Body Experience After Liver Transplantation: A Body Grid Examination
AN  - 1892266255
AB  - Living with a donated organ raises not only clinical aspects, such as surgery risks and possible graft rejection, but also questions regarding the psychological integration of the donor organ and the recipient's body experience. Organ recipients need to cope with the transplantation and its impact on their bodies and lives. This study presents findings concerning the psychological outcome of liver recipients and their body experience after transplantation. The focus lies on the psychological integration of the liver by the recipients and on differences in the body experience between recipients of a living liver donation (LDLT) and a deceased donor donation (LTx). To study the subjective body experience and the donor-organ integration, we used the body grid, a modification of the repertory grid technique pioneered by Kelly (1955). This technique allows both a quantitative and a qualitative research approach. We examined 22 liver recipients (12 LDLT; 10 LTx), matched for age, gender, years since transplantation, and type of liver disease. Additionally, quality of life data were collected using the Short Form-8 health survey (SF-8), along with sociodemographic data, including the current living situation, changes after transplantation, living donor data, and the donor-recipient relationship for the LDLT cases. Correlations between the SF-8 scores and the element distances were calculated. The results depict the recipients' body experiences after liver transplantation, the psychological integration of the transplanted organ, and correlations between quality of life and organ integration. Differences between the LDLT and LTx group are discussed, as well as implications for improving the treatment and psychological support of the recipients.

T1  - How and why organisations use social media: five use types and their relation to absorptive capacity
AN  - 1903663783
AB  - In this paper, we examine the relation between social media use and the absorptive capacity of organisations. Over the past 10 years, many organisations have systematically adopted social media. Trade press and consulting companies often claim that the systematic use of social media increases the performance of organisations. However, such claims are typically neither empirically grounded nor theoretically examined. In this paper, based on key informant interviews at 20 organisations, we examine these claims empirically and theoretically. Firstly, we examine the ways in which social media are used by organisations. We identify five different social media use types that support different organisational purposes (broadcast, dialogue, collaboration, knowledge management and sociability). Secondly, we analyse how these five social media use types relate to organisations’ absorptive capacity. We find that particular social media use types (e.g., dialogue) support organisations’ absorptive capacity and, ultimately, their performance although others (e.g., sociability) do not.

T1  - Packaging colour research by tobacco companies: the pack as a product characteristic
AN  - 1894679818
AB  - Background

              
Tobacco companies use colour on cigarette packaging and labelling to communicate brand imagery, diminish health concerns, and as a replacement for prohibited descriptive words ('light' and 'mild') to make misleading claims about reduced risks.

              
Methods

              
We analysed previously secret tobacco industry documents to identify additional ways in which cigarette companies tested and manipulated pack colours to affect consumers' perceptions of the cigarettes' flavour and strength.

              
Results

              
Cigarette companies' approach to package design is based on 'sensation transference' in which consumers transfer sensations they derive from the packaging to the product itself. Companies manipulate consumers' perceptions of the taste and strength of cigarettes by changing the colour of the packaging. For example, even without changes to the tobacco blends, flavourings or additives, consumers perceive the taste of cigarettes in packages with red and darker colours to be fuller flavoured and stronger, and cigarettes in packs with more white and lighter colours are perceived to taste lighter and be less harmful.

              
Conclusions

              
Companies use pack colours to manipulate consumers' perceptions of the taste, strength and health impacts of the cigarettes inside the packs, thereby altering their characteristics and effectively creating new products. In countries that do not require standardised packaging, regulators should consider colour equivalently to other changes in cigarette characteristics (eg, physical characteristics, ingredients, additives and flavourings) when making determinations about whether or not to permit new products on the market.

T1  - Adaptation resources in subjects with social and psychosomatic disadaptation: a comparative analysis
AN  - 1916651216
AB  - In this article the features of social-relationship systems are analyzed based on the data from a sociopsychological empirical study conducted in two stages (2002 and 2014) on a large sample with the help of g. Kelly’s Repertory grid Technique. A. V. Petrovsky’s three-factor interpersonal-relationships model as interpreted for closed groups by M. Yu. Kondratev and the concept of the closed society as described by Karl Popper provide the foundation for the theoretical hypothesis we tested. The empirical data obtained in 2002 came from 391 participants of different ages who were living in provincial towns in the Nizhny Novgorod region. The elderly respondents (232 people) had lived almost all their lives under the Soviet regime; the middle-aged respondents (159 people) got their education and started their careers in the USSR. Soviet society is considered to be closed because of its authoritarian and collectivist nature, static social structure, and dogmatic ideology. It is argued that both closed societies and closed groups are characterized by a rigid hierarchical social structure, isolation from other systems, and depersonalization of social relations. We have proved that members of a closed group and citizens of a closed society have similar social-relationship matrices.

T1  - Self-narrative reconstruction after dilemma-focused therapy for depression: A comparison of good and poor outcome cases
AN  - 1843962424
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted)

              
Objective: The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of self-changes after an intervention for depression focused on implicative dilemmas, a type of cognitive conflict related to identity. As recent research has highlighted the relevance of identity-related dilemmas in clients with depression, we sought to assess the way in which clients resolve such inner conflicts after a tailored dilemma-focused intervention and how this is reflected in the clients' self-narratives. Method: We used three instruments to observe differences between good (n = 5) and poor (n = 5) outcome cases: (i) the Repertory Grid Technique to track the resolution of dilemmas, (ii) the Change Interview to compile clients' accounts of changes at posttreatment, and (iii) the Innovative Moments Coding System to examine the emergence of clients' novelties at the Change Interview. Results: Groups did not differ in terms of the number and relevance of client-identified significantly helpful events. However, between-group differences were found for the resolution of dilemmas and for the proportion of high-level innovative moment (IM) types. Furthermore, a greater self-narrative reconstruction was associated with higher levels of symptom improvement. Conclusions: Good outcome cases seem to be associated with the resolution of conflicts and high-level IMs.

T1  - SYSTEMIC COUPLE THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION: CHANGES IN INTERPERSONAL PERCEPTION / TERAPIA SISTÉMICA DE PAREJA EN LA DEPRESIÓN: CAMBIOS EN LA PERCEPCIÓN INTERPERSONAL
AN  - 2231321051
AB  - This study explores the relation between interpersonal perception and reduction of depressive symptoms in systemic couple’s therapy. Based on a sample of thirteen couples in which one member is suffering depression, we assessed interpersonal perception using the Couple’s Grid, as well as dyadic adjustment before and after undergoing a manualized systemic couple therapy for depression. Results suggested that certain changes in perceived and metaperceived similarity, empathic accuracy and communality on view of self, especially on the part of the non-depressed spouses, were related to patient’s clinical changes. These findings can contribute to identify mechanisms of change in couple therapy for depression.
Este estudio explora la relación entre la percepción interpersonal y la disminución de los síntomas depresivos en la terapia sistémica de pareja. A partir de una muestra de trece parejas en las que un miembro sufre depresión, evaluamos la percepción interpersonal de los cónyuges mediante la Rejilla de Pareja y el ajuste diádico, antes y después de un proceso de terapia sistémica de pareja protocolizado para la depresión. Los resultados señalan que ciertos cambios en la percepción y metapercepción de similitud, precisión empática y en el grado de acuerdo en la visión del yo, sobre todo por parte de los cónyuges no deprimidos, están relacionados con el cambio clínico de los pacientes. Estos resultados podrían contribuir a identificar los mecanismos de cambio en la terapia de pareja en la depresión.

The manufacturers in competition are in a haste to launch newer and improved products but the product form development process is manual and becomes bottleneck in the early launch of products. The need of automation in product form design is thus recognized by the industry. This work proposes a solution by automating the form design process of the ever demanding and changing industry thus proposes to reduce the pressure on industrial designers. This solution also adds to cost and time efficiency. In this work, a method for product design suggestion has been suggested where in the factors influencing the design were identified using repertory grid technique (RGT) and based on inputs of these factors, a fuzzy inference based system is developed which suggests the possible output forms in 3D for the designer to further modify and take forward towards the design finalization stage.

T1  - The consumption of management ideas: a cognitive perspective
AN  - 1732758320
AB  - Purpose              - Building on recent research that emphasizes the role of managers as central in the adoption and implementation of management ideas, the purpose of this paper is to explore the reasons why managers may vary in their responses toward these ideas.              Design/methodology/approach              - Drawing on a cognitive perspective, the research uses a repertory grid approach to analyze survey data from 189 managers.              Findings              - Rather than stressing only the role of organizational context, the paper indicates the likelihood that more invariant mental models shaped by especially position and disposition play an important role in explaining the way managers view and eventually implement management ideas.              Originality/value              - The findings indicate the significance of cognitive factors in explaining managers' attitudes toward ideas, and advance the understanding of the variety in managers' responses toward these ideas, particularly in implementation trajectories.

T1  - Cognition, Behavior, and Team Structure in Enterprise Systems Implementation: A Comparative Study
AN  - 1755482375
AB  - The METRICS framework was developed during a landmark enterprise-wide system implementation in a Brazilian university. It was designed as a tool for managing the social subsystem (cognition, behavior, and structure) of customer teams as they work with external technology and business teams. Our research draws on METRICS to verify the stability of cognitive, behavioral, and structural attributes that are expected to impact the performance of customer teams in projects. We compare two studies developed in different periods, with different methods, theories, projects, and types of teams, and in different geographical, cultural, and economic regions of Brazil -- the south and the northeast. Data collection and analysis were based on personal constructs theory and the repertory grid technique applied to select information technology professionals from external teams (that worked with customer teams) in the northeast. With 77.3% (68/88) of the original measures verified empirically, the framework was considered stable across multiple settings. Given that enterprise-wide system implementation usually involves global technology vendors, and since Brazil is an illustrative case of Latin America and the developing world, our research contributes with insights into the social aspects of customer teams that impact project performance.

T1  - Ethics, Risk and Benefits Associated with Different Applications of Nanotechnology: a Comparison of Expert and Consumer Perceptions of Drivers of Societal Acceptance
AN  - 1703894364
AB  - Examining those risk and benefit perceptions utilised in the formation of attitudes and opinions about emerging technologies such as nanotechnology can be useful for both industry and policy makers involved in their development, implementation and regulation. A broad range of different socio-psychological and affective factors may influence consumer responses to different applications of nanotechnology, including ethical concerns. A useful approach to identifying relevant consumer concerns and innovation priorities is to develop predictive constructs which can be used to differentiate applications of nanotechnology in a way which is meaningful to consumers. This requires elicitation of attitudinal constructs from consumers, rather than measuring attitudes assumed to be important by the researcher. Psychological factors influencing societal responses to 15 applications of nanotechnology drawn from different application areas (e.g. medicine, agriculture and environment, food, military, sports, and cosmetics) were identified using repertory grid method in conjunction with generalised Procrustes analysis. The results suggested that people differentiate nanotechnology applications based on the extent to which they perceive them to be beneficial, useful, necessary and important. The benefits may be offset by perceived risks focusing on fear and ethical concerns. Compared to an earlier expert study on societal acceptance of nanotechnology, consumers emphasised ethical issues compared to experts but had less concern regarding potential physical contact with the product and time to market introduction. Consumers envisaged fewer issues with several applications compared to experts, in particular food applications.

T1  - Value-in-Use and Mobile Technologies: A General Approach for Value-in-Use Measurement and a Specific Application Based on Smartphone Usage
AN  - 1625816538
AB  - The increasing number of offerings that support consumers' daily routines has led to a growing discussion in scientific research about consumers' usage processes. A theoretical foundation for this discussion is offered by the service-dominant logic of marketing. The central idea is that value creation for a consumer is not based on mere product ownership but rather evolves through the usage of various offerings in terms of value-in-use. However, there is no universally accepted method to capture usage processes and analyze them with regard to value-in-use. The article therefore suggests a method for capturing value-in-use. For this purpose the repertory grid method is applied which is further adapted according to the underlying theoretical assumptions and empirically tested in a qualitative study on smartphone usage. On the basis of the findings, a specific value-in-use scale is then developed. Finally, this scale is validated in a quantitative study. The results indicate that the adapted repertory grid method is a promising approach to capture usage processes and the value-in-use created through these processes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Book Review: Classroom-based Language Assessment
AN  - 1610920422
AB  - [...]a number of studies investigate the issue of teacher perceptions and teacher assessment literacy and the need for professional development.

The authors found that the approach which involved comparison of self-assessment questionnaires with test results, progress on set tasks and completion of reflective tasks produced a number of benefits for learners, including greater awareness of their learning needs and increased motivation and engagement, in addition to evidence of learning.

The authors used the repertory grid technique, which employs a structured interview format and factor analysis, to generate a set of constructs (e.g., giving feedback and engaging students in self/ peer assessment) for effective formative assessment practice based on participants descriptions of colleagues who they perceived as effective, average or ineffective in terms of their formative assessment practices.

[...]of this process, the authors found that both participants modified and expanded their original set of constructs and developed greater awareness of their own and others views on assessment, which the authors hoped might lead to improved formative assessment practices.

Presence or feel being located in virtual environment can make the Virtual Reality application more effective. One type of Virtual Reality application is Image-based Virtual Reality application; which defined as the panoramic virtual environment that mimic the real environment which users can interact with. Due to the limited interaction function, none research exists between Image-based Virtual Reality application and user's Presence experience. However, Communication Theory claims that one type of presence which is spatial presence can be experienced by users with virtual environments that match the real environment. As motivated by this theory, An exploratory study on Image-based Virtual Reality and Spatial Presence is conducted by using Repertory Grid Technique. The objective of this study is to measure the user's spatial presence experience and to identify the factors that could enhance the experience. The result revealed that IBVR application could developed user's spatial presence experience. Moreover, a few IBVR characteristics are revealed by this study. However, in this paper, the result on the story line in IBVR application is only presented. Our results suggested three features of story line in IBVR application that could create users spatial presence experience; clear story line, acceptable story line, and end-start visual of the story line.

T1  - Validating and Improving a Knowledge Acquisition Approach for Architectural Decisions
AN  - 2116429125
AB  - Software architects make architectural decisions such as choosing architecture patterns or frameworks. Capturing architectural decisions reduces evolution costs for software systems. Existing approaches overlook the challenge of capturing tacit knowledge about architectural decisions. Previously, we proposed the REGAIN approach to capture tacit knowledge about architectural decisions. REGAIN is based on the Repertory Grid technique, a powerful knowledge acquisition approach from knowledge engineering. However, REGAIN lacked industrial validation. Therefore, in this paper, we initially present a study to ensure that REGAIN meets the needs of industrial architects. We interviewed 16 architects who indicated REGAIN advantages such as systematic decision-making support. Also, architects indicated improvement opportunities, in particular tool support and the possibility to prioritize concerns that are used to evaluate decision alternatives. Therefore, we conducted an additional study to evaluate two approaches for prioritizing concerns: pairwise-comparisons and the hundred-dollar approach. We conducted an experiment with 30 graduate students to compare the two prioritization approaches. Based on the results of the experiment, we added the hundred-dollar approach to REGAIN. Moreover, based on the study with architects and the experiment with students, we implemented open source tool support for REGAIN, which architects can use to capture architectural decisions.

Presence in Virtual Reality application can be defined as the user's feeling of being located in a synthetic environment. However, previous studies only produced results about the factors of Geometry-based Virtual Reality characteristics that could enhance user's presence experience. The studies on Image-based Virtual Reality is still lacking. Thus, we had conducted an exploratory study to find out the list of IBVR characteristics that could enhance user's spatial presence experience by using Repertory Grid technique. Based on our study, a few IBVR characteristics could enhance the experience. However, this paper only presents about overall navigation function in Image-based Virtual Reality as one of the factor that could enhance the experience. The result was analyzed with Focus Cluster Grid from WebGrid V. The features of the overall navigation should have standardized icon and ease of navigation.

T1  - A systematic review of qualitative research on the contributory factors leading to medicine-related problems from the perspectives of adult patients with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus
AN  - 1785295893
AB  - Objectives

              
To synthesise contributing factors leading to medicine-related problems (MRPs) in adult patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes mellitus from their perspectives.

              
Design

              
A systematic literature review of qualitative studies regarding the contributory factors leading to MRPs, medication errors and non-adherence, followed by a thematic synthesis of the studies.

              
Data sources

              
We screened Pubmed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, PsycInfo, International Pharmaceutical Abstract and PsycExtra for qualitative studies (interviews, focus groups and questionnaires of a qualitative nature).

              
Review methods

              
Thematic synthesis was achieved by coding and developing themes from the findings of qualitative studies.

              
Results

              
The synthesis yielded 21 studies that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three themes emerged that involved contributing factors to MRPs: patient-related factors including socioeconomic factors (beliefs, feeling victimised, history of the condition, lack of finance, lack of motivation and low self-esteem) and lifestyle factors (diet, lack of exercise/time to see the doctor, obesity, smoking and stress), medicine-related factors (belief in natural remedies, fear of medicine, lack of belief in medicines, lack of knowledge, non-adherence and polypharmacy) and condition-related factors (lack of knowledge/understanding, fear of condition and its complications, and lack of control).

              
Conclusions

              
MRPs represent a major health threat, especially among adult patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes mellitus. The patients' perspectives uncovered hidden factors that could cause and/or contribute to MRPs in these groups of patients.

T1  - Technology Two Ways: Modeling Mathematics Teacher Educators' Use of Technology in the Classroom
AN  - 1640767784
AB  - This study explores teacher educators' personal theories about the instructional practices central to preparing future teachers, how they enact those personal theories in the classroom, how they represent the relationship between content, pedagogy, and technology, and the function of technology in teacher educators' personal theories about the teaching of mathematics and their practices as enacted in the classroom. The conceptual frameworks of knowledge as situated and technology as situated provide a theoretical and analytical lens for examining individual instructor's conceptions and classroom activity as situated in the context of experiences and relationships in the social world. The research design employs a mixed method design to examine data collected from a representative sample of three full-time faculty members teaching methods of teaching mathematics in elementary education at the undergraduate level. Three primary types of data were collected and analyzed:   a) structured interviews using the repertory grid technique to model the mathematics education instructors' schemata regarding the teaching of mathematics methods; b) content analysis of classroom observations to develop models that represent the relationship of pedagogy, content, and technology as enacted in the classrooms; and c) brief retrospective protocols after each observed class session to explore the reasoning and individual choices made by an instructor that underlie their teaching decisions in the classroom. Findings reveal that although  digital technology may not appear to be an essential component of an instructor's toolkit, technology can still play an integral role in teaching. This study puts forward the idea of repurposing as technology -- the ability to repurpose items as models, tools, and visual representations and integrate them into the curriculum. The instructors themselves became the technology, or the mediational tool, and introduced students to new meanings for "old" cultural artifacts in the classroom. Knowledge about the relationships between pedagogy, content, and technology and the function of technology in the classroom can be used to inform professional development for teacher educators with the goal of improving teacher preparation in mathematics education.

T1  - Achieving Customer Satisfaction through Integrated Products and Services: An Exploratory Study
AN  - 1443844739
AB  - Complex products such as manufacturing equipment have always needed maintenance and repair services. Increasingly, leading manufacturers are integrating products and services to generate increased revenues and achieve customer satisfaction. Designing integrated products and services requires a different approach to new product development and a clear understanding of how customers perceive the value they obtain from actual usage of products and services -- so-called value-in-use. However, there is a lack of research on integrated products and services and how they impact customer satisfaction. An exploratory study was undertaken to understand customers' views on integrated products and services and the value-in-use derived from such offerings. As value-in-use and its impacts are complicated concepts, a technique from psychology -- Repertory Grid Technique -- was used to gather data in 33 interviews. The interviews allowed a deep understanding of customer views on integrated products and services to be obtained, and a systematic analysis identified the key attributes of value-in-use. In order to probe further, the data were then analyzed using Honey's procedure, which identified the impact of the attributes of value-in-use on customer satisfaction. Two key attributes -- relational dynamic and access -- were found to have the most influence on customer satisfaction. This paper contributes to the innovation field by identifying customer needs for integrated products and services and how these impact customer satisfaction. These are key points and need to be fully considered by managers during new product and service development. Similarly, the paper identifies a number of important areas for further research.

T1  - An intellectual capital-based differentiation theory of innovation practice
AN  - 1441371021
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to respond to calls to research recognising impediments to innovation practice. The paper argues that decision-making preferences by risk-averse managers are a key impediment to the organisational support required for the commercialisation of new ideas, by exploring the relationship between forms of intellectual capital (IC) and innovation. As a result, categories are derived that contrast with the current grand theory that IC drives innovative practices. Design/methodology/approach - The paper critically examines cross-sectional empirical data gathered through semi-structured interviews with 27 Australian executive managers from leading Australian companies and the public sector. These interviews elicited narratives about successful and unsuccessful innovations where interviewees had significant involvement in the outcome. In all, 54 narratives of innovation from executive managers - 27 successes and 27 failures, were analysed using the repertory grid technique to unearth patterns about the process of innovation, especially in relation to the stability of the business environment and the need for innovation. Findings - The paper finds that successful innovation in a context identified as demonstrating risk-averse decision-making behaviours requires different management approaches, depending on whether the innovation is radical, evolutionary or incremental. The paper discovers 12 different factors contributing to innovation processes and identifies those that are more likely to contribute to the success of innovative endeavours. From this the current grand theory that IC drives innovative practices is challenged by developing an IC-based differentiation theory of innovation practice. Research limitations/implications - As always, the observations and conclusions reached are limited to the 27 interviews and the Australian context. Further, findings are based on the authors' objective analysis. As with any qualitative study the authors also caution about generalising the findings, and as with any theory it should be used to develop insights into actions, rather than prescribing them. Practical implications - For educators it highlights the need to teach students to critique innovation rather than accepting that all innovation is beneficial. For researchers it shows they must avoid success bias by investigating both successful and failed innovations, developing differentiation theories of innovation practice. The findings highlight how senior managers responsible for enabling and resourcing innovation need to develop skills for identifying the innovation type enabled, matching it to an appropriate strategic approach. Finally, for policy makers it shows how different forms of successful innovation require different approaches, and each can be encouraged, developed and enabled differently. Originality/value - The paper is novel because it addresses the interaction and complexities of the different factors that enable successful innovation and possibly contribute to innovation failures, and the types of innovation relevant to each context. This approach is in contrast to the contemporary innovation literature, which tends to focus on successful radical innovation. As a result, the paper offers a more holistic view of the diverse and interrelated factors that impact innovation success and/or failure.

T1  - Foundations for the Reconceptualization of the e-Textbook
AN  - 1380703217
AB  - An ever-widening range of digital artifacts is transforming our daily lives as we communicate, locate, play, learn, and much more with and through them. As the inherent ubiquitous computing model allows us to do all that while moving across a wide variety of settings and contexts, thus, resulting in a new sense of self among users, it challenges our understanding of how humans interact with and through computers. Where previously there was one technology, one application, one user, all packaged into one fairly stable unit, there is now an ever-changing configuration of technologies, applications and actors. Within this context and in an abbreviated way, this article lays the foundation for an ongoing project that aims to re-conceptualize the e-Textbook as aggregations of both professionally authored and user-contributed content accessible through a wide range of artifacts by tackling the challenges of designing for ubiquitous computing interaction through the understanding of how humans interact with and through ecologies of artifacts while pursuing their activities; and by advancing technology-enhanced learning experiences, moving away from the replication of traditional practices and models.

T1  - Clinical Pharmacy; New Clinical Pharmacy Study Findings Have Been Published by Investigators at Gold Coast Hospital
AN  - 1035654438
AB  - Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Gold Coast Hospital, "Patients were divided into those categorised as adherent (MARS score a parts per thousand yen 23) and those categorised as non-adherent (MARS score < 23). Necessity beliefs scores from BMQ and the frequency of statements generated from the repertory grid portion of the questionnaire were compared between these two groups. Forty-three patients were interviewed with a mean age (+/- SD) of 64 (+/- 17) years and thirty-six (83.7 %) were male. Thirty-seven (86.0 %) patients were categorised as adherent; the remaining six (14.0 %) as non-adherent. The 43 patients generated a total of 262 statements about their medicines. The three most common themes identified were Related to fluid (36.6 %), Helps the heart (31.7 %) and Related to weight (13.7 %). There was a significantly higher median necessity score in the adherent group compared to the non adherent group (22.0 vs. 19.5, p = 0.0272).

T1  - How Do European SME Owner-Managers Make Sense of 'Stakeholder Management'?: Insights from a Cross-National Study: JBE JBE
AN  - 1030717499
AB  - Issue Title: Special issue on Stakeholder Theory(ies): Ethical Ideas and Managerial Action              The vast majority of empirical research on stakeholder management has traditionally focused on multinational corporations. Only in recent years, scholars have begun to pay attention to the stakeholder management concept in relation to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The few existing studies in this area, however, discuss SMEs as a context free category or remain focused on single country analysis. This cross-national empirical research investigates SME owner-managers' perceptions of stakeholder management in six European countries. The comparative analysis is followed by a discussion of how institutional, cultural and linguistic contexts can influence owner-managers' sensemaking of stakeholder management. Our study questions the universality of specific management terms and proposes that more attention should be paid to the institutional, cultural and linguistic environments that shape economic activity in different parts of Europe.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effective analyst: a study of what makes an effective crime and intelligence analyst
AN  - 1017837831
AB  - The current study aimed to identify the skills and abilities required by an analyst to be recognised as effective. Thirty subject matter experts (SMEs) were engaged using the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) to explore the specific skills and abilities of crime and intelligence analysts that result in them being deemed effective. Semi-structured interviews and the Critical Incident Technique (CIT) were conducted to strengthen these findings. Three clusters of variables were identified that indicate an effective analyst; they would have skills and abilities that could contribute to the development and dissemination of an analytical product, they would have an attitude that included being productive, seeking out work, having a high-level commitment and pride and having a 'can do' attitude. Some physical and personal attributes, like gender and age, were included that characterise effectiveness. The findings are discussed in relation to earlier descriptions of the skills needed to be an analyst. The findings illustrate a change from the analyst being seen as a technical specialist to a growing understanding of the analyst as part of a support structure for decision-makers. Implications of the findings for recruitment, training and development are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Aesthetic Learning About, In, With and Through the Arts: A Curriculum Study
AN  - 1016584094
AB  - Aesthetic learning is a major issue in arts education. The 'method of art' is often expected to facilitate in-depth learning not only in the arts but across the curriculum. This article defines aesthetic learning in terms of a conceptual framework based on two dimensions, one representing the goal and the other the means of aesthetic learning. The goal is described as convergent or divergent. Convergent learning is goal-directed, focused and rational, while divergent learning is explorative, open-ended and intuitive. The means are described as medium-specific or medium-neutral. Medium-specific learning emphasises the forms of representation, for example words, pictures, algebra, dance. Medium-neutral learning emphasises instrumental aspects of learning, such as academic achievement or personal development. Combining these dimensions two-by-two, the author arrives at a suggested definition of what is meant by learning about, learning in, learning with and learning through the arts. The rest of the article investigates the potential utility of this framework in various contexts and for different purposes. First, the author presents two temporary 'Culture-in-School' projects. Secondly, the framework is used to study aesthetic learning processes in sloyd (art & craft), based on student teachers' portfolios in metalwork. Thirdly, the four modes of learning are compared to equivalent modes of teaching: the instructor, the facilitator, the advisor and the educator. Fourthly, there is a discussion on the role of aesthetics in a 'balanced' curriculum. Finally, there is an argument on the need for a variety of assessment tools based on the four modes of learning and teaching, such as copying, portfolios, projects and the repertory grid technique.

T1  - User eXperience Laddering with preschoolers: unveiling attributes and benefits of cuddly toy interfaces
AN  - 940975697
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Tangible Interaction and Children

              
In this paper, we suggest Laddering as a promising empirical method to evaluate the impact of tangibility on young children's user experiences. In the first part of this paper, we explain what Laddering is. We explicate the conceptual foundations of Laddering, discuss the typical Laddering interviewing technique and focus on the Laddering data treatment. Then, we argue why Laddering might be especially valuable in a context of UX evaluations of tangible and embedded interfaces with children. In the second part of this paper, we present a case study, comparing three cuddly toy interfaces, and we demonstrate how Laddering can be used with preschoolers to explain preferences between these tangible interfaces. The case study confirms that Laddering can contribute to verifying the assumed benefits of tangibility. Laddering revealed how specific cuddly toy attributes as opposed to non-cuddly toy attributes led to specific benefits for the young participants. However, contrary to research findings from developmental literature, only children aged 5 years and older proved to be capable of performing as full Laddering respondents.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Restorying Priests as Entrepreneurs: A Reflective Essay on Entrepreneurial Leadership in the Scottish Episcopal Church
AN  - 1029938881
AB  - This paper explores and reflects upon how far clergy may act as entrepreneurial leaders in a faith-based organisation which values tradition and continuity, yet wishes to open its membership to a wider constituency. In spite of increased secularisation in Britain, religion and its role in people's lives refuses to disappear. Churches and other religious movements now frequently seek to adapt change management techniques to promote cultural diversity and thus appeal to a wider potential membership. At congregational level, clergy become responsible for implementing cultural change initiatives. Consequently, the clergy role may involve responsibility not just for spiritual and ministry issues, in the context of caring for church members' emotional needs, but also for management. If, as managers, clergy are responsible for promoting cultural change through management initiatives, it is but a short step to restory them as entrepreneurs, or at least entrepreneurial leaders. Indeed, strategic enterprise thinking is needed to achieve successful cultural change. The pressures on clergy to act as both spiritual 'therapists' and to manage sophisticated corporate operations place a strain on their ability to be also ministers, and obvious anomalies exist. For example, congregations might value leadership behaviours in their clergy, but not when leadership involves acting as a catalyst for cultural change. The more enterprising clergy can experience frustration in bringing about even small innovations and change, and may experience role strain when required to balance the need for providing individual support to existing congregation members with an expectation of appealing to new sources of membership.

AB  - This paper reports on the use of a Group Support System (GSS) to explore at a micro level some of the processes manifested when a group is negotiating strategy--processes of social and psychological negotiation. It is based on data from a series of interventions with senior management teams of three operating companies comprising a multi-national organization, and with a joint meeting subsequently involving all of the previous participants. The meetings were concerned with negotiating a new strategy for the global organization. The research involved the analysis of detailed time series data logs that exist as a result of using a GSS that is a reflection of cognitive theory.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cognitive Factors in Fibromyalgia: The Role of Self-Concept and Identity Related Conflicts
AN  - 858632581
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by the presence of diffuse and chronic musculoskeletal pain of unknown etiology. Clinical diagnosis and the merely palliative treatments considerably affect the patient's experience and the chronic course of the disease. Therefore, several authors have emphasized the need to explore issues related to self in these patients. The repertory grid technique (RGT), derived from personal construct theory, is a method designed to assess the patient's construction of self and others. A group of women with fibromyalgia (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30) were assessed using RGT. Women with fibromyalgia also completed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and a visual-analogue scale for pain, and painful tender points were explored. Results suggest that these women had a higher present self-ideal self discrepancy and a lower perceived adequacy of others, and it was more likely to find implicative dilemmas among them compared to controls. These dilemmas are a type of cognitive conflict in which the symptom is construed as "enmeshed" with positive characteristics of the self. Finally, implications of these results for the psychological treatment of fibromyalgia are suggested to give a more central role to self-identity issues and to the related cognitive conflicts.

T1  - Uncovering Hidden Meanings, Values and Insights Through Photos: EJBRM EJBRM
AN  - 856440067
AB  - This paper explores the use of photographs in qualitative business research. It demonstrates how the use of photographs can enrich the business research process through a range of techniques such as photo-elicitation, autodriving, projective prompts and phenomenological interviews. Drawing from a selection of the researchers' past studies, a comparative review of the use of photographs and the benefits they bring to the data capture process is examined. In addition, the paper highlights the dynamics involved in the process of using visual data capture methods. The photographs were used for respondents to engage in a free sorting task which is useful in uncovering respondents' values and meanings when asked to explain choices made between their photographs. The paper's findings suggest that photographs are an increasingly important tool to use in business research and that they enhance the breadth and insight of the qualitative research process.

T1  - Harnessing the Environmental Professional Expertise of Engineering Students—The Course: “Environmental Management Systems in the Industry”
AN  - 2259588375
AB  - More and more technical universities now advocate integrating sustainability in higher education and including it as a strategic goal for improving education’s quality and relevance to society. This study examines 30 fourth-year chemical engineering students, graduates of a university course designed to combine their terminological domain with sustainability-oriented goals, focusing on topics like corporate sustainability, developing environmental policy, introduction to ISO 14001—Environmental Management Systems (EMS), and environmental legislation. The study explores their perception of industrial-environmental issues and asks—How did the study unit influence the students’ ability to use their preexisting scientific knowledge, while relating to industrial-environmental issues? Our findings indicate that engineering students can develop industrial-environmental awareness, and make use of interdisciplinary knowledge beyond that strictly related to the realm of engineering. Regarding the research’s particular aim—i.e. determining the study unit’s influence on students’ ability to relate industrial-environmental issues to their own field of engineering—the findings indeed show a change in the students’ conceptions of environmental elements related to industry. The course graduates became more attentive to the environmental aspects associated with building and opening a factory, and the concepts they raised in connection with the topic gained in variety.

T1  - On identity reformation and local transition: a case from Poland
AN  - 763662906
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the process of successful introduction of total quality management (TQM) in Poland and the way in which it impacted on identity of Polish managers. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a combination of ethnographic research and repertory grid interviews. Findings - The process of TQM introduction and implementation is examined through the application of translation as a model incorporating cultural and socio-economical dimensions in addition to individual and organizational levels that shaped the development of TQM in Poland. It then draws on the idea of fantasy as theorized in Lacanian psychoanalysis in order to incorporate the unconscious element of translation process which is missing from Latour's theorization and which forms an important aspect of adoption of new technology and the emergence of a new post-transition generation of managers in Poland. The paper argues that a complex combination of contextual factors, amongst them the notion of fantasy shaped the process of translation of TQM to Poland, the identity formation of Polish managers and to the emergence of a new post-transition generation of managers in Poland. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature on the post-command transition by illustrating this process through the fantasy of total quality management explored in a specific socio-cultural and geographical context and by combining the idea of Latour's translation with Lacanian fantasy.

T1  - Exploring the measurement of basic assumptions about guests and co-workers in the hospitality industry
AN  - 746269840
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop and validate a measure of employee basic assumptions about guests and co-workers in the hospitality industry. Data were collected from two independent samples using self-administrated questionnaires and analysed using correlational and reliability analyses, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and one-way ANOVA. The analyses identified two dimensions of basic assumptions about guests, control and affect. Assumptions about co-workers also consisted of two main dimensions termed responsibility and competence. The results showed that assumptions about guest control positively correlated with subjective job performance; assumptions about guest affect and co-worker competence positively correlated with organisational commitment and job satisfaction; and assumptions about co-worker responsibility positively correlated with intentions to stay with the organisation. The findings are based on a limited sample of service employees. Even though hospitality employees' basic assumptions about guests and co-workers are validated in a service context, the suggested conceptualisation still needs a more comprehensive validation. Assumptions about competitors may be important determinants of hospitality employees' behaviour towards guests, and such assumptions should be analysed in future studies. The present study is the first to investigate simultaneously assumptions about guests and co-workers in a hospitality environment and the effect that such assumptions have on outcome variables. Altogether, the study demonstrates that basic assumptions may be a viable construct for HR management. They are easily identifiable and related to employee job satisfaction, job performance, organisational commitment, and staff turnover intentions.

T1  - MANAGING LESSONS LEARNED AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
AN  - 726776405
AB  - Every new product development (NPD) team learns a unique set of lessons in solving the many problems that arise in a typical project, and it is important to ensure that these lessons are shared. Since much of the learning is tacit in nature, it is difficult to articulate, to capture, and to disseminate. Therefore, managers face a challenge in trying to stimulate project-to-project learning. Many companies hold post-project reviews (PPRs)-meetings at the end of projects to determine the lessons learned and document them for the future. However, discussing a project, noting down the lessons learned, and entering them into a database is not sufficient. Our research at five leading German companies shows that written reports fail to convey much of the key learning from NPD teams and so managers need to focus on stimulating individual learning and running PPRs in specific ways to generate and transfer tacit knowledge. Managers also need to integrate PPRs with other mechanisms, such as mentoring schemes and knowledge brokering, to stimulate the flow of lessons learned and tacit knowledge.

T1  - Evaluation of visual video summaries: user-supplied constructs and descriptions
AN  - 898689611
AB  - Issue Title: Focused Issue on ECDL 2010

              
Evaluation of video summarization approaches requires more information on the user-perceived qualities of different types of summaries. Also, evaluation measures need to be further developed in a user-led manner. This article reports on a user-centered evaluation of visual video summaries. Four types of summaries (fastforward, user-controlled fastforward, scene clips, and storyboard) were evaluated with a set of existing performance and satisfaction measures. A repertory grid elicitation was conducted with our participants gathering evaluation constructs related to both video summary content and controls. Results showed a lack of correlation between performance and satisfaction measures. User-supplied evaluation constructs were shown to span both the performance and satisfaction dimensions of the video summary evaluation space. Most constructs achieved moderate to good inter-rater agreement in a consequent survey. Free descriptions of videos and respective summaries showed that while users are able to interpret object- and event-related information from short summaries, thematic inference lacked, leading to worse descriptions than for the full videos.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Understanding the Values of Mobile Technology in Education: A Value-Focused Thinking Approach
AN  - 747133715
AB  - Mobile technology has mobilized the human interaction in all dimensions by supporting mobile collaboration. As collaboration is key to learning in today's educational environment, mobile technology has tremendous potential in supporting and improving education and its delivery. Given that mobile technology for education is a new phenomenon that is gaining popularity, the values of using mobile technology to support education need to be further researched and better understood. In this research, we used the Value-Focused Thinking approach to interview students and instructors to identify the values of education that are enabled by mobile technology. These values are represented in the form of a means-ends objective network that not only captures the values of education facilitated by mobile technology but also depicts the relationships between these values. The means-ends objective network derived from this research can serve as a conceptual foundation for future studies and provide useful guidelines to practitioners for implementation of mobile technology in education.

T1  - PENETRATING ADOLESCENTS' MENTAL MODELS OF MP3 WITH ZMET
AN  - 195940058; 20432609
AB  - This article demonstrates the application of the Zaltman metaphor-elicitation technique (ZMET) to help adolescent consumers delve into their unconscious thoughts and provide them with insights into the use of mp3. An analysis of interview transcripts and images revealed that the ZMET process provides a description of how the knowledge structures of adolescent consumers are subdivided and grouped around important themes that frame and motivate their involvement with a product. The findings reveal that there are 33 themes of consumer knowledge structure toward mp3. Furthermore, among these themes, there are four major concepts: size / form, convenience, relaxation, comfort, and appearance. The respondents' minds include not only rational components but emotional ingredients. Notably, the results also show that music can be an effective metaphor in the application of the ZMET method.

T1  - Using the ratings grid in tourism/event management
AN  - 225183469
AB  - Ratings grids, emerging from personal construct theory, measure an individual's perception of a situation. This paper and exercises seek to demonstrate how researchers and managers can use the grid to evaluate visitors' perceptions of an attraction or event. A training exercise explains how to use the ratings grid, a type of repertory grid, to evaluate tourist attractions or special events. A ratings grid example analyzes visitors' impressions of an art festival (n=142). The steps taken for grid development, administration strategy, and analysis are discussed and described. The results suggest that visitors' impressions of the art festival are consistent with the festival's communication objectives. These findings suggest that the art festival presents itself to visitors accurately. Ratings grids are designed to examine only the elements a researcher selects. Important elements to respondents may be overlooked using this test, and the researcher will not get an accurate measure of respondents' attitudes. The exercise provides guidance to a useful method for measuring visitor perceptions and allows researchers and managers to understand visitor experiences better.

T1  - CONCEPT-GUIDED QUERY EXPANSION FOR KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT WITH SEMI-AUTOMATIC KNOWLEDGE CAPTURING
AN  - 232583115
AB  - In the knowledge economic era, enterprises have realized the importance of knowledge assets and endeavored to think how to improve their competitive abilities by managing and using knowledge assets effectively in the fast-changing environment. The usability of knowledge is limited due to its difficult access, sharing and visualization; however knowledge management systems (KMS) have proven to be efficient and effective in organizing knowledge of high complexity and in large amounts. Despite, the issue of how to effectively retrieve the desired knowledge from vast knowledge bases still remains due to the difficulty to express conceptual ideas with appropriate queries. To tackle this critical matter, we propose a new KMS solution powered by a concept-guided query expansion scheme. In addition, repertory grid analysis is conducted to semi-automatically elicit and model the structure of domain experts' tacit knowledge and build up a hierarchical concept structure. With this mechanism, availability of tacit knowledge is increased and its access and navigation facilitated, allowing users to acquire the desired knowledge and contribute to knowledge dissemination.

AB  - A complex adaptive systems perspective is used to examine the sustainability of the supply network in the commercial aerospace manufacturing sector. A framework for the analysis of coevolutionary dynamical change is used which examines the structure, integration methods and process dynamics within the supply network. Multiple methods are used for data collection from 8 firms in the sector. The framework identifies 14 management implications related closely to the sector's current heterarchical supply network archetype. The management implications address known environmental factors for the sector and the broader techno-economic paradigm. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Towards a Performance Measurement Framework for Community Development Finance Institutions in the UK: JBE JBE
AN  - 198045112
AB  - Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFI) are publicly funded organisations that provide small loans to people in financially underserved areas of the UK. Policy makers have repeatedly sought to understand and measure the performance of CDFIs to ensure the efficient use of public funds, but have struggled to identify an appropriate way of doing so. In this article, we empirically derive a framework that measures the performance of CDFIs through an analysis of their stakeholder relationships. Based on qualitative data from 20 English CDFIs, we develop a typology of CDFIs according to three dimensions: organisational structure, type of lending and type of market served. Following on from this, we derive several propositions that consider how these dimensions relate to the financial and social performance of CDFIs, and provide the basis for a performance measurement framework.

T1  - The repertory grid to unfold conflicting positions: The case of a stakeholder dialogue on prospects for hydrogen
AN  - 205255116
AB  - In this article, the authors share their experience with the application of the repertory grid method, and they demonstrate that this is an appropriate method to scrutinize complex issues and to structure stakeholder dialogues on these issues. Repertory grid is used to articulate stakeholders' conceptions of the prospects for hydrogen (H2). The aim was to highlight not only the mainstream notions of hydrogen but also conceptions that gain less prominence in the hydrogen discourse. Repertory grid was applied in a computerized fashion, with twenty-four stakeholders. The data were analyzed by means of a frequency analysis and a HOMALS analysis. The analyses demonstrate that repertory grid has been an appropriate method to structure the hydrogen dialogue in three ways: 1. it elicited the full range of concepts that stakeholders used to evaluate hydrogen options, 2. it identified the most salient hydrogen visions to be explored further in the dialogue, and 3. it helped to form dialogue groups according to these visions.

T1  - Reference theory: strategic groups and competitive benchmarking
AN  - 212083553
AB  - Purpose - The concept of strategic groups is a central theme in the field of strategic management, and over time it has been used by a considerable body of theoretical and empirical literature to examine different aspects of competitive strategy. However, to date, there has been little systematic investigation that examines aspects associated with competitive benchmarking and the impact and effect that this has on strategy development. Thus despite the level of knowledge that has been accumulated over the years regarding the dynamics of competitive landscapes, our understanding of the impact and effect of this particular matter on decision making is limited. More importantly, studies that have addressed the topic are either theoretical alone in contents or have only used secondary data. Equally, these studies have approached the subject mostly from an impersonal mathematical perspective and practitioners' views on the issue have been overlooked. This paper aims to address these weaknesses in the literature. In doing so, it seeks to place attention on the individual, which has been overlooked by previous examinations.   Design/methodology/approach- The research is cross-sectional and it is based on primary methodology, having employed qualitative techniques for analysis. It involves face-to-face semi-structured interviews combined with the repertory grid technique. The industry investigated is the UK mainstream leisure foreign package holidays. The sample size is near to the sampling frame of the research and the investigation took place between March and August 2003. Findings - It was found that managers of firms from the same strategic group consider their group as a reference point in their decision-making process and as a result of their benchmarking observations they adjust their firms' competitive strategies to reflect their group's strategic behaviour. It was also found that firms of the same strategic group are more likely to respond to market conditions and events in a similar manner. Originality/value - This paper examined issues associated with benchmarking, in the context of strategic groups, having employed primary qualitative research strategies in order to add "fresh" data on a topic that so far has merely been investigated quantitatively through secondary sources alone. As such, it has initiated a much needed contents dimension on the topic to complement the activity and process-oriented only studies in the area. The research not only tested earlier propositions in order to accumulate more evidence in the field and enable better generalisations on the subject but it has also expanded current theories in the area.

T1  - SOMATIZATION DISORDER AND COGNITIVE CONFLICTS: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY WITH A CLINICAL SAMPLE / SOMATIZACIÓN Y CONFLICTOS COGNITIVOS: ESTUDIO EXPLORATORIO CON UNA MUESTRA CLÍNICA
AN  - 2231332963
AB  - Somatization problems generate high healthcare costs, and some of its usual treatments prove ineffective and even counterproductive. An interdisciplinary treatment approach seems necessary in order to provide an integrated treatment for these patients. From this perspective, hardly-studied cognitive processes such as the subjective construction of self, symptoms, and other people should be taken into account. That is why it may be important to study cognitive conflicts, which could stand as subjective barriers for healing. The goal of the study is to investigate the relationships between implicative dilemmas, a kind of cognitive conflict that can be detected using the Repertory Grid, and a somatization scale. Results suggest that somatization scores are higher for individuals with implicative dilemmas, and that the presence of such conflicts predicts somatization better than gender, age, self-esteem, or cognitive differentiation.
Los problemas de somatización generan un elevado consumo de recursos y algunos tratamientos habituales resultan ineficaces o contraproducentes. Parece necesario un abordaje multidisciplinar que ofrezca un tratamiento integral a estos pacientes. Esta perspectiva debería tener en cuenta factores cognitivos poco estudiados como la construcción subjetiva del sí mismo, los síntomas y los demás. De ahí el interés de estudiar los conflictos cognitivos, que podrían erigirse en barreras subjetivas para la curación. El objetivo de este estudio es investigar las relaciones entre los dilemas implicativos, un tipo de conflicto cognitivo que puede detectarse con la Técnica de Rejilla, y una escala de somatización. Los resultados sugieren que las puntuaciones en somatización son más elevadas en personas con dilemas implicativos, y la presencia de estos conflictos predice mejor la somatización que el sexo, la edad, la autoestima o la diferenciación cognitiva.

T1  - Corporate Identity, Ethics and Reputation in Supplier-Buyer Relationships: JBE JBE
AN  - 198073605
AB  - Multi-national corporations (MNCs) have been criticised for not behaving ethically in some situations, which could have a negative effect on their reputation. This study examines the ethics of a large MNC in its relationship with its suppliers. A brief literature review of corporate identity, business ethics and buyer-supplier relationships is undertaken. The views and perceptions of the buying staff and the suppliers to a large South African MNC are obtained and discussed. The results indicate that this MNC has a good corporate reputation among both its suppliers (an important stakeholder) and its own buying department. The existence and implementation of formal codes of ethics was found to be a necessary, but not sufficient condition for good ethical practice. Candid relationships with suppliers emerged as a second and important factor. Ethical perceptions of buyers by suppliers are driven by the management of corporate identity, through the elements of ethical standards and candid relationships. We present a model of corporate identity/reputation in Buyer-Supplier Relationships. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Attracting Generation Y graduates: Organisational attributes, likelihood to apply and sex differences
AN  - 219353569
AB  - Building on person-organisation fit and gender self-schema, this research aims to examine UK university final year students' perception of the importance of organisational attributes and their presence in three major graduate employers. This study also seeks to explore which organisational attributes attract Generation Y men and women to apply to a management trainee position. In phase one, 32 repertory grid interviews identify 84 common constructs in undergraduates' organisational choice. A short list of 20 organisational attributes was carried forward to the phase two survey of 862 undergraduates in their final year at 22 UK universities. The respondents rate the attributes in terms of importance and then evaluate three employers in terms of perceived presence of these attributes. The students also provide the likelihood that they would apply. T-tests, correlation and multiple regression are used to test hypotheses. Among university students, the five most important organisational attributes are: 1. invest heavily in the training and development of their employees, 2. care about their employees as individuals, 3. clear opportunities for long-term career progression, 4. variety in daily work, and 5. dynamic, forward-looking approach to their business. Sex differences exist in both the importance of organisational attributes and the perceived extent of their presence in three organisations. Recruiting firms can better understand how Generation Y men and women graduates perceive the importance of organisational attributes and their presence in firms.

AB  - This paper examines a varity of examples of repertory grid research to assess how and why the technique is used. In particular, the authors focus on the strengths and weaknesses of using the repertory grid to explore the nature of close business-ot-business relationships. Compared with the more frequently used technique of qualitative depth interviews, differences were found which suggest that further research is needed to identify what really drives supplier-buyer interdependence. The research indicates the value of the repertory grid in exploring topics that are not well defined and to identify the way that business decision-makers are making sense of their work environment.

T1  - Use of Cognitive Mapping Techniques in Information Systems
AN  - 205265314
AB  - Communication in information systems (IS) research and practice is a social process that is characterized by ongoing sense making among various parties. In IS development and implementation, IS professionals and various stakeholders need to communicate effectively in order to achieve expected outcomes. Cognitive mapping techniques are used to identify subjective beliefs and to portray these beliefs externally. The outcome of a cognitive mapping technique usually is referred to as a cognitive map. In this article, the authors discuss some common cognitive mapping techniques and their applications in IS research and practice. In the process of IS development and implementation, IS professionals need to communicate with various stakeholders such as managers and users in order to understand their requirements for the system. Three commonly used cognitive mapping techniques are: 1. causal mapping, 2. semantic mapping, and 3. concept mapping. Widely used in management studies to investigate managerial and organizational cognition, cognitive mapping techniques have great potential to be applied in information systems research and practice.

T1  - Managerial cognitions of competitive environments: a strategic group analysis: MRN
AN  - 223543550
AB  - In the field of strategic management, the majority of studies analyse competitive environments from an economic standpoint, based on the implicit notion that business environments are formal and objective. As such, the human element is assumed and the role that managers play in creating and changing competitive environments is neglected. However, given that people take business decisions and drive organisations, to ignore such an important dimension of the competitive landscape is a considerable limitation to developing more holistic understandings about competitive landscapes. This study examines how managers perceive competitive terrains and discusses the impact of managerial cognitions on decision-making, competitive strategies and industry dynamics. The research is cross-sectional and based on primary research. It involves semi-structured face-to-face interviews with the sample size near to the sampling frame of the research. It was found that managers view industries and competitors subjectively and that the social construction of competitive environments as well as the process of competitive enactment both influence managerial perceptions of competition. Consequently, similarities about competitive challenges are formed. Subsequently, such perceptions affect strategic decisions on competitive strategies and resource allocation. As a result, these actions affect industry dynamics and contribute to the evolution of the industry.

The Repertory Grid interview is introduced as a method which serves both criteria. The reviewed book (Martin FROMM) and the corresponding software (Martin FROMM & Andreas BACHER) serve as an adequate introduction to this method. Nevertheless, a research question is needed that is rational and well implemented within the field of inquiry.              URN: urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs060263

T1  - Consumers' perception of wine packaging: a case study
AN  - 235113349
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present the methodology adopted and the main results achieved by an exploratory study on consumers perception of wine packaging. The research was designed to elicit the relevant dimensions through which consumers perceive and describe differences between bottles of wine. In order to allow respondents to freely express their perceptions without suggesting a priori descriptive category/dimensions a repertory grid (RGT) approach was followed. A sample of 30 consumers were asked to analyze differences across 11 bottles and to summarize them in descriptive bipolar constructs. The results were analyzed performing a consensus procrustes analysis. The attributes of bottles and labels represent the main factors underlying wine packaging perceptions. These characteristics are the very first "signal" perceived looking at bottles. Consumers use them to define more abstract "constructs" they use while assessing alternative products and choosing among them. From a methodological point of view, this study confirms the interest of combining RGT and content analysis as a tool for explorative research in marketing.

T1  - Swedish auditors' view of auditing: Doing things right versus doing the right things
AN  - 232931722
AB  - The thought patterns of Swedish auditors with regard to the way in which they audit information provided by listed companies, and possible changes in their duties, are described and analyzed. Eighty-two auditors were interviewed using the repertory grid technique and open-ended interview questions. To check the stability in the thought patterns of the respondents, six retests were made and, to validate the findings, an expert panel and two reference groups consisting of auditors and other representatives of the accounting and auditing professions were consulted. Distinct patterns emerged in the mean grid of the thought patterns of all the respondents. One dimension was related to the time perspective, past versus future, and another to auditing practice. Auditors devote a relatively long time and considerable effort to objects that can be satisfactorily verified, but not to objects that they perceive as being of primary importance to investors and other stakeholders. This inconsistency in the thought patterns of the auditors is similar to the gap between auditing in practice and stakeholders' expectations of auditing, which is a phenomenon frequently found in previous research. Moreover, the auditors were very reluctant to make statements about any information except that elicited according to current practice. In addition to this traditional view, the auditors appear to be more concerned about their own situation than that of the parties they are meant to be protecting. Doing things right seems to be more important than doing the right things. That the auditors spend much time on objects that they themselves do not consider to be of primary importance for the investors and other stakeholders, and their unwillingness to change current practice is of great concern in Sweden, where there is a strong belief in self-regulation of the auditing profession.

T1  - Repertory grid analysis: An application to the measurement of destination images
AN  - 236409017
AB  - The objective of this paper is to demonstrate and evaluate the use of repertory grid analysis (RGA) in the context of a study of destination brand images. The study explored the components of destination brand image from a business tourism perspective. RGA was used to identify the constructs used by events managers in a sample of 25 UK organisations to characterise the brand images of 15 UK towns and cities. The study identified eight categories of brand image attribute. Factor analysis reduced these to three higher level dimensions, an overall destination attractiveness dimension and two sub-dimensions: functionality and ambience. The paper concludes with a discussion of the benefits and limitations of RGA as a technique for measuring destination brand images and argues that it offers significant advantages over alternative techniques with regard to image measurement.

T1  - Studying Trust in Virtual Organizations
AN  - 224074942
AB  - The core objective of this article is to introduce the repertory grid technique as a powerful methodology into research on trust in virtual organizations. This technique is particularly capable of yielding insights into the subjective meaning of trust. Virtual organizations have been chosen as our empirical field because the literature shows a broad consensus that trust is one of the most important success factors for the initiation, development, and continuation of activities in these types of hybrid regimes. On the basis of a discussion of the literature on trust in networks and virtual organizations, we present our empirical study of two Swiss virtual organizations. It reveals that the emergence of trust in virtual organizations depends strongly on personal bonds and shared experiences in the practical realization of projects, whereas generalized rules and contracts play only a supplementary role. Localized and experience-based commitments as well as the proactive behavior of the partners involved are identified as decisive denominators of trust. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Valuing customer relationships: Using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to incorporate relationship risk
AN  - 236993003
AB  - This paper argues the necessity to consider risk and return when valuing customer relationships or developing relationship strategies. It discusses how risk might be calculated and proposes the use of the capital asset pricing model. The model's adaptation to customer contexts and implications for strategy are discussed. Differences between relational exchange in business markets and transactional exchange on investment markets are highlighted. In the light of these, the model should guide rather than prescribe strategic direction.

T1  - Comparing managers' mental models of competition: Why self-report measures of belief similarity won't do
AN  - 222370308
AB  - In their study designed to investigate the relative impact of 'task and institutional influences on managers' mental models of competition,' Daniels et al. (2002) elicited cognitive maps using 2 complementary ideographic mapping procedures: a card-sort technique and a variant of the repertory grid. Drawing on research into the cognitive processes underpinning similarity judgments, it is argued that this approach to the comparison of cognitive maps suffers from a number of severe limitations which are likely to bias the results in favor of the research hypotheses under test, thus leading to increased type I errors.

T1  - Task and institutional influences on managers' mental models of competition
AN  - 222369270
AB  - From institutional theory, it is argued that: 1. the competitive, or task environment may encourage divergence of management cognition between organizations, management functions and among senior managers, and 2. that the institutional environment may encourage cognitive convergence at the level of the industry, the strategic group and within institutionalized practices linked to management functions and level. Findings indicate neither the superiority of exclusively task nor institutional explanations of management cognition. However, the results do indicate some influence of the institutional environment, most noticeably through the convergence of mental models within middle managers across the industry.

T1  - Constructivism in Social Work: Towards a Participative Practice Viability
AN  - 203136812
AB  - Social work has traditionally drawn upon an expansive range of social science research and theorizing as its claim upon a 'knowledge base'. Recent debates have explored the need for the profession to develop its own theory of social work knowledge arising from practice. This paper seeks to extend the boundaries of these ideas through an operational and epistemological elaboration and critique of Sheppard's (1995a; 1998) notion of a practice paradigm. In an examination of the contribution of constructivism and the seminal work of George Kelly's (1955) Psychology of Personal Constructs, arguments are put forward for social work practice to focus upon the co-construction of viable working relationships with service users as the basis for an anti-oppressive and participative professionalism. It argues that the sterile philosophical dichotomies between objectivism/realism-subjectivism/interpretivism and the equally unhelpful social work division between practice-theory should be integrated within a situated, participatory, constructivist approach to knowledge creation in social work practice and continuing professional development.

T1  - Personal constructs, childhood sexual abuse and revictimization
AN  - 218937939; 11589329
AB  - Within the theoretical framework of Ryle's Procedural Sequence Object Relations Model and Kelly's Personal Construct Theory, this study investigates sex-role polarization of incest survivors and the centrality of abuse within survivors' constructs of men that may contribute to revictimization. Repertory grid methodology was used with 40 female survivors of childhood sexual abuse and 28 non-abused women. Grid measures and psychometric measures were compared between groups of women who had and had not experienced childhood sexual abuse, revictimized and non-revictimized survivors, and survivors who had and had not experienced incestuous abuse. Results showed significant differences between survivors and non-abused women, with survivors having higher levels of depression and perceived distress, lower self-esteem and higher self/ ideal self discrepancy. Hypothesized differences in sex-role polarization were not found. There were few differences between revictimized and non-revictimized survivors, although revictimized survivors rated 'self now' as more powerful than non-revictimized survivors. No differences were found between survivors who had and had not experienced incestuous abuse. In addition to the value of exploring personal constructs, a range of models need to be considered in understanding revictimization and women's construal of men. The implications of using repertory grid methodology for research and clinical work are discussed.

T1  - Analysis of repertory grids in clinical practice
AN  - 218680538; 11593952
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper illustrates the use of several different forms of analysis of repertory grid data, using a case study of a client who completed repertory grids at various stages of therapy. METHOD: Participants in a survivors' group completed grids before and after therapy and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Grids from one of the participants, who had been sexually abused as a child, are presented using different levels of analysis: visual inspection of the raw grid; analysis of dissimilarities between pairs of elements or constructs; hierarchical cluster analysis of elements and constructs both separately and combined; principal components analysis; biplot representation of elements and constructs combined; multidimensional scaling analysis and unfolding analysis. The latter two methods also provide ways of presenting a combined analysis of a number of grids. Computer packages are reviewed, and SYSTAT commands are presented to perform the analyses. RESULTS: The review of methods illustrates how different levels of analysis can usefully back up clients' own accounts of progress through therapy, from detailed analysis of individual ratings in the raw grid, through analyses that pull out structural patterns at the expense of detail, to the broad sweep provided by methods that combine data from a number of grids. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of repertory grids completed at various stages of therapy can provide useful qualitative information on progress, but can also provide some simple quantitative measures (such as Self-Ideal Self discrepancy as a measure of self esteem) to track progress. Different forms of analysis can be informative, highlighting different aspects of progress, but also allowing checks on adequacy and goodness-of-fit of particular analyses.

T1  - Toward an expert assessment of intangibles in technology-based new ventures
AN  - 304783440
AB  - This dissertation documents three initial phases of an investigation into intangible aspects of new ventures. The assessment of intangibles, which are often present in startups, is a topic of recent interest (Stewart 1997, Clement, Hammerer and Schwarz 1998, Shepherd and Douglas 1999, Sullivan 1999, Smart 1999, Boulton et al 2000), particularly during the early-stage investment-decision process of technology-based ventures. On one hand, investors are challenged to properly assess new opportunities. At the same time, entrepreneurs or innovators face the formidable task of communicating what is, sometimes, nothing more than just an “extraordinary” idea. In such situations, the decision to continue with the due diligence process, and finally to invest, is based frequently on those aspects that are intangible.    Phase I of the research was a pilot study to elicit vocabulary from investors and determine their need to assess intangibles. A group of twelve investment-decision experts were interviewed. The interviews were content analysed. The results of the content analysis suggest that there is a need on the part of both investors and entrepreneurs to improve their assessment of intangibles when making an investment decision.    Phase II used Repertory Grid, a technique based on personal construct psychology, to identify intangibles used by experts when assessing or communicating new venture opportunities. Five venture capitalists and five entrepreneurs were interviewed. The results reveal a total of 149 constructs. Principal component analyses indicate that each interviewee identified only a few major areas of emphasis in his or her thinking. Furthermore, a cluster analysis revealed that each investor had his or her own way of conceiving the intangibles in a given proposal. Next, an extremity analysis identified each person's most meaningful constructs. As a result of these analyses, the operation of intangibles during the investment-decision process is evident. From this phase, what is remarkable is the contribution of Repertory Grid technique to identify intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs.    Phase III involved the development of a fuzzy expert system as a diagnostic tool to assess intangibles in new technology-based ventures. The system was validated with five experts in investment-decision making. The results show a promising future of this tool when used for assisting entrepreneurs and investors to assess venture viability. Finally, the results of this research could also open the door for this technique to be applied in other areas such as: scientific proposals, requisition of grants, and assessment of employment candidates.

T1  - The role of information acquisition and knowledge use in managing customer relationships
AN  - 252307515
AB  - The nature of personal selling has evolved from an emphasis on discrete transactions to a greater concern with the management of customer relationships through active problem solving and proactive strategies. This change has resulted in a shift from a focus on influencing buyer behavior to managing the conflict inherent in buyer-seller relationships. Account management in this partnering role requires more adaptive approaches or consultative sales techniques. The shift in personal selling toward customer relationship management requires account managers to have a deep understanding of their customer's requirements, and an ability to align those requirements with their organization's capabilities in order to build competitive advantages for both parties.    The purpose of this study was to examine the knowledge acquisition and use strategies employed by exceptional-performing customer relationship managers. First, the study examined the knowledge structure characteristics that drive exceptional performance by account managers. Second, particular attention was given to exploring the information acquisition strategies of exceptional-performing account managers for both formal and informal sources of market information.    A Fortune 500 transportation services firm provided the organizational context for the study. Participants were account managers who were responsible for a broad portfolio of accounts that included relational and transactional customers. These account managers were drawn from the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico, and demonstrated very different sales performance records. Data was collected from fifty-eight account managers. Depth interviews and a follow-up questionnaire were used to collect the data. Fifty-seven of the fifty-eight follow-up surveys were returned, resulting in a 98% return rate.    Results of data analysis showed strong support for the conceptual framework. All of the proposed knowledge structure variables significantly correlated the difference in performance between exceptional performers and low performers. For example, exceptional performers possessed more elaborate knowledge structures that aligned customer goals with the selling firm's capabilities. The informal networks established by exceptional account managers within their own firm and the customer organization were found to be key drivers of account manager performance. Exceptional performing account managers demonstrated a greater propensity to scan formal sources of information in search of broad customer trends. Overall, the results help to clarify the key differences between exceptional-performing account managers and their lower performing peers.

T1  - The meaning of mothers' and nurses' interactions during a child's hospitalization
AN  - 304631259
AB  - When a child becomes acutely ill and requires hospitalization, there is mounting evidence that parents' relationships with professionals are one of the key factors that result in outcomes such as anxiety, frustration, conflict, stress, mistrust and dissatisfaction (Dixon, 1996; Jarrett, 1996; Knafl & Dixon, 1984; Tiedeman, 1997). The purpose of this study is to understand how mothers perceive and attribute meaning to their interactions with nurses in the hospital setting, and to examine nurses' perspectives towards parents that impact on their interactions with parents in this setting. Personal Construct Theory (PCT)(Kelly, 1955) and the accompanying repertory grid technique was used to examine the personal constructs through which mothers and nurses viewed, interpreted, and thereby gave meaning to their interactions in the hospital setting. Twenty mothers and 20 nurses completed repertory technique rating grids, a brief qualitative questionnaire and a demographic instrument during the acute, unexpected hospitalization of their child (ages 3months to 12 years). Results indicate that the meaning mothers attribute to their interactions is primarily influenced by their evaluation of the nurse. Mothers' evaluation of their interactions with nurses (either effective or ineffective) influenced their ability to participate in their child's hospitalization and their decision to do so either actively or passively. Similarly, nurses' interactions were influenced by their evaluation of mothers. Nurses classified mothers as either “difficult” or “ideal” based on whether they felt valued and listened to by the parent. Ideal parents were those who were perceived to listen carefully and follow the nurse's directions. Difficult parents were those who were perceived to not comply with nurses' expectations, to which nurses responded with rigid and controlling approaches to these parents. Group analyses revealed that mothers valued nurses who were able to convey a sense of trust and respect towards them and convey a sense of equality in their relationship with them. In contrast, communication with parents, and control over the parents and the child's care were the most pervasive and consistent themes in the meaning systems of the nurses, yet how these themes were viewed and interpreted varied according to complexity and according to specific people and situations.

T1  - Strategic groups and cognitive groups: Theoretical comparison and empirical analysis in the homebuilding industry
AN  - 250290835
AB  - Strategic group is a group of firms in an industry that follow the same or a similar strategy. This concept has been widely used for researchers as an intermediate tool between the analysis of the industry as a whole and the individual analysis of competing firms. Its main use is a tool to help managers cope with their bounded rationality and reduce uncertainty. What this thesis tries to answer is whether these researcher-defined groupings are really relevant for the strategy-making process and whether they correspond with managers personal taxonomies of competitors.    To do so, we analyze the Homebuilding Industry in a small town developing two parallel empirical studies. First, we identify the strategic groups that integrate that industry following the traditional economic-approach—cluster analyses. Moreover, using repertory grid technique, we analyze managers' mental models in order to obtain their personal taxonomies of competitors. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that both categorization of competitors, research-defined and manager defined are convergent, suggesting a direct and indirect causation between them.    The dissertation is organized as follows: In the first chapter we justify the Thesis and show our objectives and hypothesis to be contrasted. The second chapter makes a literature review on strategic groups. The third chapter does the same review on cognitive groups literature. In the fourth chapter we present an integrative model that compares the Positioning School—strategic groups—with the Cognitive School cognitive groups. The fifth chapter shows the results of the first empirical analysis carried out on the Homebuilding Industry. The sixth chapter presents the managers' vision of their industry. The seventh chapter compares both classifications of competitors. The eight chapter presents the conclusions and implications of the findings for academics and managers.

T1  - The development and validation of the Visual Analogue Self-Esteem Scale (VASES)
AN  - 218626349; 10590826; 20058347
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a visual analogue measure of self-esteem and test its psychometric properties. DESIGN: Two correlational studies involving samples of university students and aphasic speakers. METHOD: Two hundred and forty-three university students completed multiple measures of self-esteem, depression and anxiety as well as measures of transitory mood and social desirability (Study 1). Two samples of aphasic speakers (N = 14 and N = 20) completed the Visual Analogue Self-Esteem Scale (VASES), the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale and measures of depression and anxiety. (Study 2). RESULTS: Study 1 found evidence of good internal and test-retest reliability, construct validity and convergent and discriminant validity for a 10-item VASES. Study 2 demonstrated good internal reliability among aphasic speakers. CONCLUSION: The VASES is a short and easy to administer measure of self-esteem that possesses good psychometric properties.

AN  - 205127370; 03760502
AB  - A counselling skills course run by a London hospital for 11 health professionals was evaluated.  The course covered family counselling skills and child management techniques.  Qualitative and quantitative measures were used at five times of testing over a period of 10 months.  It was found that participants improved self-perceptions of their counselling ability, increased their knowledge of counselling theories, and considered the course to be helpful in their subsequent work with families.  There was no significant change in trainees' self-concept scores.

T1  - The Goldilocks pursuit in organizational selection: How recruiters form and use judgments of person-organization fit
AN  - 304350948
AB  - The Goldlilocks Pursuit describes recruiters' attempts to hire applicants who are "just right" for their companies. Judgments of "just right" include recruiters' perceptions of an applicant's person-job (P-J) and person-organization (P-O) fit. P-J fit has been the traditional focus of selection research, but P-O fit has only recently been investigated as a factor in hiring decisions.    Two studies were conducted to answer remaining questions regarding recruiters' P-O fit perceptions. A qualitative methodology was used in Study One to determine what types of characteristics recruiters use to assess applicants' P-O fit, and how similar these characteristics are across organizations. Thirty-two recruiters from four consulting organizations completed repertory grid interviews (Kelly, 1955) in which they compared video-taped job applicants to determine who had the best P-J and P-O fit. Results indicate both unique and shared predictors of fit perceptions, with more skill and experience characteristics leading to judgments of P-J fit, and more personality and value characteristics relating to P-O fit perceptions. Many recruiters used idiosyncratic preferences to determine both types of fit; however, there was also support for organization-specific and universally desirable characteristics influencing fit perceptions.    Structural equations modeling was used in Study Two to determine the relative effects of P-O fit, P-J fit, applicant-recruiter similarity, and liking on recruiters' hiring recommendations. Recruiters from two organizations evaluated 80 applicants during a regular recruiting cycle. Results indicate that perceptions of P-J and P-O fit are highly related, but are predicted by somewhat distinct characteristics. P-J fit perceptions were the best predictor of hiring recommendations, although P-O fit perceptions were also significant predictors. Results also suggest that perceptions of P-O fit mediate the relationship between perceived applicant-recruiter similarity and hiring recommendations better than does recruiters' liking of the applicants.    Together, these studies provide a comprehensive examination of how recruiters form and use impressions of applicants' P-O fit during the selection process. Implications for improving assessments of fit and how they are used in conjunction with other evaluations of applicants to increase the overall effectiveness of the hiring process intended to find the applicants whose fit is "just right" are included.

T1  - Risk and organizational behaviour: a research model
AN  - 214376978
AB  - The discipline of risk management is in the ascendancy. A theoretical framework is defined in order to investigate a part of the link between risk management strategy and organizational behavior. The critical factor of risk perception in managers and its impact on implementation strategy is considered. The types of risk strategy an organization follows and its structure are defined using various measures of distinct factors. By establishing the nature and cause of relationships between the measures and factors, the relationship between organizational approaches to risk and organization structure may be identified. A method is described for evaluating this relationship.

T1  - Reframing the organization: Why implementing total quality is easier said than done
AN  - 210968384; 00887682
AB  - A cognitive theory is presented of why planned organizational change efforts, such as total quality initiatives, often fail.  The theory suggests that employees resist total quality because their beliefs about the organization's identity constrain understanding and create cognitive opposition to radical change.  A dynamic model is proposed in which successful implementation of fundamental organizational transformation is partly dependent on management's ability to reframe the change over time.  Implementation may best be accomplished through a series of middle-range changes that are large enough to overcome cognitive inertia and relieve organizational stress, but not so large that members believe the proposed change is unobtainable or undesirable.

T1  - Do Psychotherapists Use Different Construct Subsystems for Construing Clients and Acquaintances? A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 848882787
AB  - Forty-seven psychotherapists were studied to determine if they used different construct subsystems for construing clients and personal acquaintances. The sample included therapists who varied in terms of sex, age, years of experience, and clinical discipline. Subjects chose six personal acquaintances and six nonpsychotic individual therapy clients who were then used as elements in a Repertory Grid. Constructs were elicited by comparing pairs of elements; all elements were rated on the constructs. It was found that constructs elicited about one domain (clients or acquaintances) were less applicable to elements from the other domain. Therapists more often used constructs related to emotional stability when construing clients than acquaintances, whereas differences in construct content were not evident on several other dimensions. The domain of client construal exhibited greater cognitive differentiation and hierarchical organization than did that of acquaintance construal. The results suggest that therapists use different conceptual subsystems for client and acquaintance construal. Implications for the training of therapists are discussed.
