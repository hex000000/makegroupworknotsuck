T1  - STRATEGIC DECISION SUPPORT FOR URBAN SERVICE DESIGN
AN  - 2216225378
AB  - The relevant studies should go beyond specification of explicit knowledge and unveil the tacit knowledge in KM of urban service design.

[...]this study develops an ontology-based KM framework as an innovative management tool for decision-making in the urban areas of the age-friendly cities.

(2011a) stated the service commitment lies at the core of any kind service action(s) delivered by the service provider to the service consumer at a certain cost or wellbeing of an individual, in a certain way at any situation.

[...]the content analysis of the interviews with the municipality employees focuses on service experience that was committed to an individual in the context of a specific event.

The premise of this study lies in the effective management of urban service sector that makes use of explicit and tacit knowledge while making interconnections between the two knowledge domains.

[...]the case study underpins the 'strategic decision support' level of the service process layer in the urban service sector.

Determining the appropriate tools, techniques and methods in identifying the characteristics of the citizens, urban environments and touch points are crucial for the satisfaction and wellbeing of citizens (Figure 2).

Since the citizens have diverse physical characteristics and needs, expectations and desires as well as social status, a priority setting should be provided for the diverse population.

T1  - One-year follow-up of a randomized trial with a dilemma-focused intervention for depression: Exploring an alternative to problem-oriented strategies
AN  - 2155918359
AB  - Background 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is aimed to counteract cognitions and behaviours that are considered as dysfunctional. The aim of the study is to test whether the inclusion of a non-counteractive approach (dilemma-focused intervention, DFI) in combination with CBT group therapy will yield better short- and long-term outcomes than an intervention conducted entirely using CBT.
 Method 
A total of 128 patients with depression and at least one cognitive conflict, of six health community centres in Barcelona, participated from November of 2011 to December of 2014 in seven weekly group CBT sessions and were then randomly allocated to either DFI or CBT (eight individual sessions each) by an independent researcher. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II at baseline, at the end of therapy and three- and twelve-month follow-ups. Therapists did not participate in any of the assessments nor in the randomisation of patients and evaluators were masked to group assignment. Both intention to treat and complete case analyses were performed using linear mixed models with random effects.
 Findings 
According to intention-to-treat analysis (F2, 179 = 0.69) and complete case analysis (F2, 146 = 0.88), both conditions similarly reduced the severity of symptoms across posttreatment assessments. For the 77 participants (CBTgroup +CBTindividual = 40; CBTgroup+DFIindividual = 37) that completed allocated treatment and one-year follow-up assessment, response and remission rates were relative higher for the DFI condition, however no significant differences were found between treatment conditions. The relapse rates were similar between treatment conditions (CBTgroup +CBTindividual = 7/20; CBTgroup+DFIindividual = 8/22).
 Interpretation 
Although using a counteractive approach across all the treatment sessions is quite effective, it does not seem to be necessary to produce significant improvement. DFI may be considered as an alternative, which could be included in a wider treatment for depression.

T1  - Known and unknown requirements in healthcare
AN  - 2079517856
AB  - We report experience in requirements elicitation of domain knowledge from experts in clinical and cognitive neurosciences. The elicitation target was a causal model for early signs of dementia indicated by changes in user behaviour and errors apparent in logs of computer activity. A Delphi-style process consisting of workshops with experts followed by a questionnaire was adopted. The paper describes how the elicitation process had to be adapted to deal with problems encountered in terminology and limited consensus among the experts. In spite of the difficulties encountered, a partial causal model of user behavioural pathologies and errors was elicited. This informed requirements for configuring data- and text-mining tools to search for the specific data patterns. Lessons learned for elicitation from experts are presented, and the implications for requirements are discussed as “unknown unknowns”, as well as configuration requirements for directing data-/text-mining tools towards refining awareness requirements in healthcare applications.

T1  - In their own words: employee attitudes towards information security
AN  - 2085549225
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to uncover employee attitudes towards information security and to address the issue of social acceptability bias in information security research.Design/methodology/approachThe study used personal construct psychology and repertory grids as the foundation for the study in a mixed-methods design. Data collection consisted of 11 in-depth interviews followed by a survey with 115 employee responses. The data from the interviews informed the design of the survey.FindingsThe results of the interviews identified a number of themes around individual responsibility for information security and the ability of individuals to contribute to information security. The survey demonstrated that those employees who thought the that organisation was driven by the need to protect information also thought that the risks were overstated and that their colleagues were overly cautious. Conversely, employees who thought that the organisation was driven by the need to optimise its use of information felt that the security risks were justified and that colleagues took too many risks.Research limitations/implicationsThe survey findings were not statistically significant, but by breaking the survey results down further across business areas, it was possible to see differences within groups of individuals within the organisation.Originality/valueThe literature review highlights the issue of social acceptability bias and the problem of uncovering weakly held attitudes. In this study, the use of repertory grids offers a way of addressing these issues.

T1  - Reasons to Randomize: Sort-Specific Effects on Construct Content in Cross-Sectional Repertory Grid Studies
AN  - 2015015156
AB  - Several articles have discussed the effect of variations in the repertory grid procedure on measures derived from the data it generates. Largely unexplored, in contrast, is the effect of a more subtle variation inherent in the grid procedure itself: the specific combination of elements used in a dyad or triad during elicitation. This study investigates the differential effects of a specific element combination on the elicited constructs by means of data-driven content analysis. Three independent repertory grid samples were collected, one using nutrition styles (N = 70) and two using occupational profiles as elements (both N = 60). For the latter two studies, the sorting technique (dyad vs. triad) was varied. A pronounced specific effect of the sorts on elicited construct content was found across all three studies.

T1  - Identity, Competitors &amp; Distinctiveness: Who Are We? Who Are They?
AN  - 2117117290
AB  - Organizational identity has emerged as an important theoretical concept. However, our understanding of distinctiveness is inadequate since this aspect of organizational identity has received limited research attention. Accordingly, this paper reports the results of a qualitative study designed to explore how managers construe their organization's identity distinctiveness. Based on this study's findings, this paper furthers our knowledge of organizational identity by presenting a theoretical model depicting how identity distinctiveness is construed. Overall, the results of this study suggest that managers construct an internal story - via markets, competencies and intangible identity attributes - which they believe both legitimates and distinguishes their organization.

T1  - Developing a Mixed-Methods Method to Model Elderly Health Technology Adoption with Fuzzy Cognitive Map, and Its Application in Adoption of Remote Health Monitoring Technologies by Elderly Women
AN  - 2110793811
AB  - Providing healthcare to the ever-rising elderly population has become a severe challenge and a top priority. Emerging innovations in healthcare, such as remote health monitoring technologies, promise to provide a better quality of care and reduce the cost of healthcare. However, many elderly people reject healthcare innovations. This lack of adoption constitutes a big practical problem because it keeps the elderly from benefiting from technology advances. The phenomenon is even more pronounced among elderly women, who represent the majority of the elderly population.    A plethora of studies in the field of technology adoption resulted in sound, but highly generalized theories that are too parsimonious to provide practical insight into the phenomenon of elderly healthcare technology adoption (EHTA). There is a call to arms for novel approaches that facilitate the creation of models that expand technology adoption theories to the specifics of EHTA. This dissertation is a response to this call to arms, and it contributes to modeling practice in the EHTA field. It uses fuzzy cognitive mapping to design a novel mixed-methods modeling approach. Since elderly women constitute the majority of the elderly population, this dissertation treats elderly women’s health technology adoption (EWHTA) as the case-in-point.

T1  - Establishing Design Strategies and an Assessment Tool of Home Appliances to Promote Sustainable Behavior for the New Poor
AN  - 2108741430
AB  - Environmental benefits related to home appliance life cycles depend on how these products are used. Designing home appliances that promote sustainable behavior is an effective way to reduce environmental impacts. This study aimed to increase relevant opportunities for promoting sustainable behavior practices on the new poor through home appliances, which is rarely discussed in the fields of design for sustainable behavior (DfSB) and product design. In particular, relevant assessment tools or indicators are lacking in DfSB, and people’s use of home appliances is generally unsustainable. Therefore, repertory grid technology was used to understand the perceptions of the new poor, develop an assessment tool, and construct design strategies for home appliances that promote sustainable behavior. Data were collected from the new poor and from designers. Through cluster and principal component analyses, three strategy types were proposed that corresponded to different product features, suggestions, and guidance. In addition, the effectiveness and potential of an assessment tool were demonstrated using the Wilcoxon rank test. The findings could be used by designers, retailers, and green marketers to propose effective product design programs that promote sustainable behavior of the new poor during product use.

T1  - Assessment of Caregiving Constructs: Toward a Personal, Familial, Group, and Cultural Construction of Dementia Care through the Eyes of Personal Construct Psychology
AN  - 1963842618
AB  - Conditions that cause cognitive impairment and behavioural and personality changes, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia, have global impact across cultures. However, the experience of dementia care can vary between individuals, families, formal caregivers, and social groups from various cultures. Self-reported measures, caregiving stress models, and conceptual theories have been developed to address the physical, financial, psychological, and social factors associated with the experience of dementia care. Given the cross-cultural variability in the experience of dementia care, it is important for such methodologies to take individual and cultural construct systems into account. We contend that personal and group constructs associated with dementia care should be explored in both the formal and informal caregiving contexts. Therefore, in this paper we introduce the theory of Personal Construct Psychology (PCP) with its explicit philosophy, well-elaborated theory, and derived assessment methods as a potential constructivist research approach to examine the personal, familial, group, and cultural construct systems that determine the experience of dementia caregiving. These concepts and assessment procedures are illustrated in this paper through case study examples and scenarios from the context of dementia care with a focus on family home caregivers. This paper elaborates the assessment and therapeutic approaches of personal construct theory (PCT) to further expand alternatives for support services and program interventions and to amplify policies for dementia care within and across cultures.

T1  - An investigation of construct relevant and irrelevant features of mathematics problem-solving questions using comparative judgement and Kelly's Repertory Grid
AN  - 1925215208
AB  - The relationship between the characteristics of 33 mathematical problem-solving questions answered by 16-year-old students in England and the quality of problem-solving elicited was investigated in two studies. The first study used comparative judgement (CJ) to estimate the quality of the problem-solving elicited by each question, involving 33 mathematics teachers judging pairs of journal-style responses to the questions and the application of the Bradley-Terry model. In the second study a variant of Kelly's Repertory Grid was used with five mathematics teachers to identify 23 dimensions along which the problem-solving questions varied. Significant relationships between ratings on some dimensions and the problem-solving quality estimated in the first study were found. This suggests that the Kelly's Repertory Grid approach could be an effective way to identify features of questions that are relevant to the construct being assessed and features that could be potential sources of construct-irrelevant variance in test scores.

T1  - School Principals’ Views on Administration Work, Their “Frequent Turnover” and Its Effects on Their Work
AN  - 1922375160
AB  - School administrators' "frequent turnover" has been discussed intensively in the Turkish Educational System recently. Currently, principals are selectedfor 4 years after an interview conducted by a committee of directors of national education. After that period, they either go back to their classes or are chosen for another 4 years for the last time. This frequent turnover can be disruptive for schools. This study was conducted to determine school principals' views on administration work and this frequent turnover. The study employed a qualitative research design. The participants were 20 principals chosen with maximum sampling method. The data were analyzed with content analysis method. Results revealed that most principals consider administration work as a professional and career profession which requires expertise, leadership qualities and education in educational administration. They also evaluate the selection system as problematic and limiting their work period with 4 years prevents them from realizing long-term projects. Finally, they think that the system works with political considerations clearly.

T1  - Effects of a Peer Assessment System Based on a Grid-based Knowledge Classification Approach on Computer Skills Training
AN  - 1843843356
AB  - In this study, a peer assessment system using the grid-based knowledge classification approach was developed to improve students’ performance during computer skills training. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted in a computer skills certification course. The participants were divided into three groups: one that learned with traditional instruction, one given the conventional peer-assessment system, and one using the proposed peer-assessment system. The results showed that the learning achievements of the students using the proposed system were significantly better than those of the other two groups. Therefore, integrating the knowledge engineering approach with the peer-assessment process can benefit students’ learning, and help them attain computer skills certification. The dynamic peer assessment with knowledge classification approach is not only useful, but can also be repeatedly applied to different question sets of the certificate of computer software application.

T1  - Exploring conditions for transformative learning in workintegrated education
AN  - 2231207312
AB  - A qualitative study was undertaken that explored the conditions for transformative learning in cooperative education as a form of work-integrated learning (WIL), towards the development of a theoretical model. Four case studies were analyzed based on interviews with WIL students, supervisors and their co-op coordinator. The findings revealed that the enablers most involved in contributing to transformative learning were: opportunities for work and learning, a supportive environment, student capabilities, co-workers, supervisors, and assessment and reflection practices. Furthermore, the integration of these transformative outcomes into the WIL academic program or workplace was dependent upon the time and value given to transformative processes, institutional requirements and a positive emotional environment. The implications of these findings are that WIL theoretical models include considerations of: perspective, socio-cultural context, dialectic and mediated processes, time and creating a positive emotional space to support the critical reflection necessary for transformative learning outcomes. Furthermore, adopting a view of WIL as an interaction between two systems opens up possibilities for innovation and renewal in our WIL programs and workplaces.

TT  - Perceptions of legitimacy in the EU: congruence or incongruence of the political culture of elites and citizens?
AN  - 1647465981
AB  - Key literature in EU legitimisation research indicates deep-rooted delegitimisation of the EU. While this perception has been validated empirically for elites, no data exists to support this thesis from the citizens' perspective. The following paper discusses how methodological deficits in survey research could be the cause of such common findings on EU legitimacy. Facing the limitations of pure qualitative or quantitative methods, the article presents the repertory grid, a mixed-methods approach, as an alternative method to measure attitudes and perceptions. By measuring citizens' understanding of legitimacy and how they perceive the legitimacy of the EU, the paper reveals new results on this topic and introduces the repertory grid method.

T1  - Evaluation of Indian Institutes of Management Library Websites in India
AN  - 1467836818
AB  - This study evaluates multimedia, content, and user-interface features of select library websites of Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) in India and uses a mixed-method approach that combines both quantitative and qualitative analyses of IIM library websites evaluation with the help of a specially designed checklist. The various features of the websites of six IIM libraries - IIM- Ahmadebad, IIM-Bangalore, IIM-Calcutta, IIM-Indore, IIM-Kozhikode, and IIM-Lucknow- are evaluated. The qualitative part of the checklist contains 11 features pertaining to the homepages of the IIM library websites, which serves as a recording device for descriptive data and quantitative. The quantitative part of checklist contains 135 dichotomous questions relating to various evaluation aspects of multimedia, content, and user-interface features. A quantitative five-point rating scale was designed to provide a meaningful numerical rating for each individual feature of the IIM library websites and rank them based on features. This paper attempts to show that study websites are lagging behind in exploiting the full potential of the multimedia features - particularly, audio and video features - as well as instructional tools, currency, and Web/Library 2.0 features. Findings show that many of the study IIM library websites in India are ranked above average mainly providing general information of the library and their services. The study website with the highest score is for IIM-Lucknow with 65.92 per cent (89 out of 135) and the least scored study website belongs to IIM-Bangalore with 42.96 per cent (58/135). These findings open the door to librarians to explore the possibilities of communication, promotion, text responses, and catalogue access via mobile technology with the help of library websites. It is hoped that study libraries will attend to this lacunae and soon develop more interactive and up-to-date dynamic content, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0-based features, instant messaging (IM) reference services, virtual library tours, floor maps, online library calendar, FAQs, bulletin boards, discussion forums, Listserve, web counter, effective searching features, etc. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The relationship of counselor education program applicants' cognitive complexity to other admission criteria
AN  - 1667397894
AB  - Counselor cognitive complexity is a counselor’s ability to recognize and organize multiple characteristics that might affect client needs. I examined whether various admissions criteria–Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Verbal, Quantitative, and Analytical Writing scores; previous coursework grade point averages; and faculty coleaders’ admissions group interview ratings–for 182 applicants to a southwestern U.S. CACREP-accredited master’s counseling program predicted cognitive complexity scores on a modified Counselor Cognitions Questionnaire (CCQ). Participants were predominantly ages 20 to 30 years (91.8%), female (91.8%), and White (81.3%).    Multiple regression analyses showed statistical significance with small effect sizes: the admissions criteria together significantly predicted cognitive complexity differentiation (p = .033), accounting for 6.6% of variance, and cognitive complexity integration (p = .003), accounting for 9.8% of variance. The small effect sizes and low variance percentages support the idea that cognitive complexity measured by the modified CCQ is a substantially different phenomenon from commonly-assessed academic aptitude and personality characteristics. If future researchers confirm these findings with additional samples, subsequent researchers could determine whether one or both domains of cognitive complexity, either alone or in combination with one or more of the commonly used admissions criteria, could help counselor educators better predict which applicants will be successful in master’s programs and the counseling field.

T1  - Cochlear Implants; Researchers from Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital Detail New Studies and Findings in the Area of Cochlear Implants
AN  - 1022381565
AB  - The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research by the authors from Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, "Psychological well-being was assessed using the Beck Youth Inventory, a series of five self-report questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, disruptive behaviour, anger, and self-esteem. Correlational analyses indicated that perceiving oneself as close to any peer, irrespective of which peer, was associated with better psychological well-being. There was also a significant positive association between perceived degree of similarity specifically to hearing peers, and psychological well-being. The closer the implanted adolescents perceived themselves to be to their hearing peers, the better their overall psychological well-being.

T1  - APPROACHES ON METRICS AND TAXONOMY IN SERIOUS GAMES
AN  - 1286686450
AB  - Serious Games, along with the various definitions they entangled and the multifaceted approaches they benefitted from in relation to their applicability, are and still gain ground in becoming a resourceful educational material provided they are used as a means to an end, the educational objectives per se. What research still has to cover is a rethinking of all the elements in terms of educational effectiveness, given this landmark has got new dimensions with the 21st century.

              
In this context, SGs offer new ways of learning which are highly consistent with the competence-based approaches that are also reflected in modern theories of effective learning. Subsequently, in deploying Serious Games on the realm of education and training, special tools will be claimed as mandatory in order to both know what games to use, when and where, for what reasons, but also how to measure the gain and the usefulness of playing a game. This stresses the need for an accurate work on taxonomy and metrics, a topic that is currently under complex development within GaLA (Game and Learning Alliance) NoE (Network of Excellence) funded by the EU under the 7FP.

              
This paper documents new perspectives on Evaluation metrics and taxonomy in Serious Games , considering state of the art taxonomies and repositories, such as the Serious.GameClassification7, Imagine8,Engage learning9 databases; in this respect, a new knowledge space is being developed, based on the following dimensions: description/classification of SG, analysis of SG components, application domains, pedagogy, deployment and technologies, with the pedagogical dimension divided into two parts- theoretical frameworks and pedagogical outcomes. Such tools for a multi-faceted enduser from educator to student and labour market stakeholder, from corporate to industria will eventually contribute to a standardized vision over what educational effectiveness represents in the context of Serious Games.

T1  - Factors influencing societal response of nanotechnology: an expert stakeholder analysis
AN  - 1285634497
AB  - Nanotechnology can be described as an emerging technology and, as has been the case with other emerging technologies such as genetic modification, different socio-psychological factors will potentially influence societal responses to its development and application. These factors will play an important role in how nanotechnology is developed and commercialised. This article aims to identify expert opinion on factors influencing societal response to applications of nanotechnology. Structured interviews with experts on nanotechnology from North West Europe were conducted using repertory grid methodology in conjunction with generalized Procrustes analysis to examine the psychological constructs underlying societal uptake of 15 key applications of nanotechnology drawn from different areas (e.g. medicine, agriculture and environment, chemical, food, military, sports, and cosmetics). Based on expert judgement, the main factors influencing societal response to different applications of nanotechnology will be the extent to which applications are perceived to be beneficial, useful, and necessary, and how 'real' and physically close to the end-user these applications are perceived to be by the public.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Innovating entrepreneurial pedagogy: examples from France and Germany
AN  - 762696586
AB  - Purpose - This paper - one of only a few examples - aims to conduct a cross-national research into innovative teaching approaches in entrepreneurship in France and Germany. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on two cross-cultural cases and reflects on the experiences of two innovative teaching approaches in two European settings. The underlying aim of this investigation is to identify commonalities and differences between the approaches, establish learning between the different Higher Education institutions as well as to investigate the transferability of such approaches to other cultural environments. Findings - This research has highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary learning in entrepreneurship research. Whereas, in the German case, management and other disciplines work together to create the example of the "practice firm", in the French case entrepreneurship theories, network theories and cognitive science are brought together to create a new approach to learning about entrepreneurship. Both approaches highlight the importance of the personal development of the course participants by empowering the student to be proactive. Research limitations/implications - The paper builds on the early experiences with both the concept of the "practice firm" and the application of repertory grids in entrepreneurial pedagogy, which justifies the highly exploratory character of this research. More research is necessary to establish students' opinion about such innovative approaches, also on a cross-national level. Practical implications - The paper provides examples of effective practices for encouraging entrepreneurial thinking in the classroom. More such comparative work is necessary on a European, but also on a wider international, scale to encourage learning, in particular for those involved in teaching entrepreneurship, but also for policy makers who are looking for new ways to stimulate entrepreneurial thinking. Originality/value - The paper is innovative as it compares and contrasts two innovative approaches to teaching entrepreneurship in two European countries and hence fills a gap in the literature.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Impact of Group Cognitive Complexity on Group Satisfaction: A Person-Environment Fit Perspective
AN  - 807503150
AB  - Groups have the potential to increase the satisfaction of their members (Campion, Medsker, & Higgs, 1993; Gladstein, 1984; Hackman, 1987; Katzell & Guzzo, 1983; Mason & Griffin, 2002, 2003). Thus, consideration of group characteristics in organizations is an important issue (Druckman & Bjork, 1991). In this study, the interactive influence of group cognitive complexity, task complexity, and group structure with satisfaction was analyzed. The findings suggest that when a task is complex, a decentralized structure leads to greater satisfaction than a centralized structure. Furthermore, groups lower in cognitive complexity were influenced more than complex groups by a mismatch between task complexity and group structure. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - University Science Graduates’ Environmental Perceptions Regarding Industry
AN  - 2259569398
AB  - Throughout the last decade, the issue of sustainable development has become a major public debate topic. University science graduates have the potential of playing an important mediatory role in this debate. This is because their scientific vocation not only provides them with scientific knowledge about the core issues involved, but also puts them in the position of occupying key managerial and leadership positions in the industrial community. This study examines whether environmental knowledge plays a part in university science graduates’ thinking about industry on an intuitive level and also in their mode of responding to concrete environmental problems. Our findings indicate that most of the graduates do not demonstrate an awareness of the relevance of environmental knowledge to questions connected to industry; furthermore, they do not apply their scientific knowledge-base in contexts related explicitly to environmental aspects of the industrial process.

T1  - Measuring psychological change in offenders with intellectual disabilities and alcohol misuse using repertory grids: two case examples
AN  - 213054293
AB  - Measuring psychological change in offenders with intellectual disabilities undergoing psychological therapy presents the clinician with a variety of challenges. They include finding measures sensitive enough to measure the often modest cognitive changes that take place over the course of psychological therapy and finding measures appropriate to use with this client group. Little is known about the use of alcohol in offenders with intellectual disabilities. Repertory grids, based on Kelly's (1955) theory of personality, have been shown to be an adaptable, sensitive, reliable and valid measure of psychological change. Two case examples are used to show how repertory grids can be used to assess the treatment gains made by patients undergoing different (though similar) psychological interventions aimed at reducing alcohol misuse.

T1  - Depression; Studies from University of Barcelona provide new data on depression
AN  - 194582189
AB  - "The RepGrids of participants were analyzed using the computer program GRIDCOR (Feixas & Cornejo, 2002). Consistent with hypotheses, those with depressive disorders perceived themselves and others more negatively, perceived themselves as different from others, and generated fewer constructs to describe self and others in comparison to the non-clinical group. There were no differences in use of extreme ratings or in unidimensional construing (percent variance accounted for by the first factor in correspondence analysis) on the RepGrid. RepGrid techniques offer the potential to better understand the processes of construction of the self and others in persons with depressive disorders," wrote G. Feixas and colleagues, University of Barcelona.

T1  - Team roles and team performance in defence acquisition
AN  - 216355980
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this research is to examine the extent to which Belbin's team role theories are relevant and can be used to predict performance in the context of the Integrated Project Teams (IPTs) responsible for acquisition within the Ministry of Defence (MoD). <b>Design/methodology/approach<b><b><b><b><b></b>- A sample of seven IPTs across the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) completed Belbin's (1981) manual 8 Role Self Perception Inventory in order to determine their team role preferences. A team performance survey, developed by Barbara Senior in 2005, was then used to determine perceived process performance. The relationship between these two variables was examined in detail. <b>Findings<b><b><b><b><b></b> - The results provide support to the proposition that Belbin's Team Role Theory is relevant in MoD acquisition. Certain team roles are more predominant in certain functional roles within IPTs and this duplication could have a negative impact on performance, given Belbin's assertion that "balanced" teams will perform better than "unbalanced". The difficulties in objectively assessing team role balance (both narratively and statistically) are discussed in detail. <b>Research limitations/implications<b><b><b><b><b></b>- Whilst a representative sample of IPTs was investigated, a longitudinal study of a more extensive sample is required to substantiate these initial findings. <b>Practical implications<b><b><b><b><b></b> - Belbin's Team Role Theory provides a cost effective means of potentially improving performance in defence acquisition. <b>        Originality/value<b><b><b><b><b></b> - While there have been some unpublished studies into functional roles in MoD teams, there is a research lacuna with regard to the examination of team roles as a factor influencing performance in defence acquisition.

T1  - Deriving auditory features from triadic comparisons
AN  - 204212642; 17557598
AB  - A feature-based representation of auditory stimuli is proposed and tested experimentally. Within a measurement-theoretical framework, it is possible to decide whether a representation of subjective judgments with a set of auditory features is possible and how unique such a representation is. Furthermore, the method avoids confounding listeners' perceptual and verbal abilities, in that it strictly separates the process of identifying auditory features from labeling them. The approach was applied to simple synthetic sounds with well-defined physical properties (narrow-band noises and complex tones). For each stimulus triad, listeners had to judge whether the first two sounds displayed a common feature that was not shared by the third, by responding with a simple "yes" or "no." Because of the high degree of consistency in the responses, feature structures could be obtained for most of the subjects. In summary, the proposed procedure constitutes a supplement to the arsenal of psychometric methods with the main focus of identifying the type of sensation itself, rather than of measuring its threshold or magnitude.

AB  - The article remembers 50 years of G. A. Kelly's Personal Construct Psychology (PCP). It uses K. Lewins's distinction between "Aristotelian" and "Galileian" modes of thought by a presentation of the PCP. It discusses basic axioms and principles of the PCP (the fundamental postulate and the dichotomy corollary) and presents this theory as an example of the purely Galileian approach which is able to define various concepts used in particular classificatory Aristotelian areas (e.g. mental representation, unconsciousness) and to integrate different methodological approaches (e.g. psychometrical and hermeneutical) with the help of simple formal principles. The study discusses also problems of research in the field of the PCP. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using a Functional Approach to Change Preservice Teachers' Understanding of Mathematics Software
AN  - 274692932
AB  - This study examined the structure of two preservice teachers' understandings of educational software in mathematics using repertory grid techniques. Specifically, the study focused on how teacher educators can enable preservice teachers to discern the features of mathematics software, and develop pedagogical goals that reflect the affordances and constraints of available tools. Results showed a deepening of knowledge and a differentiation of knowledge following experiences of exploration, evaluation, and comparison of different types of software. Results imply that directing preservice teachers' attention to utilizing the functional characteristics of software for developing plans and for the design of instruction may be fruitful for more effective integration of software in their future teaching. However, participants' preexisting content knowledge and their pedagogical worldview tempered this effect. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Constructive Social Work and Personal Construct Theory: The Case of Psychological Trauma
AN  - 203139649
AB  - The complex and changing relationship between theory and practice in social work has received increasing attention in recent years. Parton (2000) has advocated a constructionist approach that underlines the similarity between the roles of the researcher and the practitioner. Personal construct theory (Kelly, 1955) is one member of the constructionist family that has particular implications for social work practice. It evolved as a pragmatic approach to psychotherapy, advocating a research supervisor/student model of the practitioner/client relationship. In this article, we elaborate its application to social work practice, drawing on contemporary work in the fields of trauma and loss to illustrate its value.

T1  - Assessing patients' preferences for treatments for angina using a modified repertory grid method
AN  - 230465738
AB  - A current popular theme in medicine concerns whether and how patients should be involved in treatment choice. Assuming patient involvement is desirable, how should one go about eliciting preferences? A variety of quantitative and qualitative methods exist that may be used for this purpose, one of which is the repertory grid method. This method involves eliciting constructs (reasons) for preferences through comparing sets of three options. This method allows the structured elicitation of the reasons behind individual preferences, but also, when used with generalised procrustes analysis (GPA), allows aggregation of individual data to reveal general preference patterns. In this study the repertory grid method was used to examine patient preferences for angina treatments with the goal of, first, gaining some understanding of general patterns of patient preference, and second, examining the likely utility of the technique in this setting. A sample of 21 patients with mild and stable angina from two general practices in Norfolk, UK was interviewed using the repertory grid method to elicit the constructs underlying their preferences amongst seven angina treatments (including 'no treatment'). Individualised questionnaires were then produced and sent to the patients for self-completion, which required rating the extent to which each construct was relevant for each treatment (scored on visual analogue rating scales). Analysis of the ratings, using GPA, showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: 'some treatment' versus 'no treatment', and drug treatment versus surgical treatment. While some treatment was generally preferred to no treatment, individuals varied in preference for drug treatments or surgical treatments. Although the latter were generally perceived as 'effective' they were also perceived, for example, as 'invasive', 'frightening', related to 'negative experiences', and being more appropriate for when symptoms are severe ('proportionate'). We consider the implications of these results for involving patients in choosing amongst treatments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using diaries to explore the characteristics of work-related gossip: Methodological considerations from exploratory multimethod research
AN  - 199301407
AB  - This paper examines the methodological considerations of diary methods, as used in exploratory multimethod research into the characteristics and function of gossip in nursing and health care organizations. There has, in the past, been a dearth of empirical research into the nature and role of gossip in organizations. Gossip is a disparate phenomenon, difficult to define, conceptually complex and resistant to paradigmatic summing up. However, research agendas are emerging in relation to gossip as both a social phenomenon, and also as an important aspect of organizational communication. This paper contributes to this emerging literature, arguing that diary methods offer a solution to the problems of researching the often private, unseen and unheard worlds of gossip in organizations. It is also argued that diary methods alone are insufficient, and that eclectic, multimethod research designs are necessary in order to manage the challenges associated with capturing and preserving the elusive nature of gossip.

T1  - Destination brand images: a business tourism perspective
AN  - 212678257
AB  - Most studies of destination brand images have been conducted from the perspective of the leisure tourist. This study identifies brand images from a business tourist perspective (people visiting destinations for business meetings, incentive events, conferences and exhibitions) and tests their relationship with perceived quality and commercial criteria. Data on the brand image attributes associated with 15 UK destinations promoting themselves as business tourism centres were collected via repertory grid analysis from a sample of 25 organisations using business tourism facilities. A self-completion questionnaire was used to measure managers' ratings of the perceived quality of each destination and the commercial criteria used to select a destination. The data were analysed and the content analysis identified eight clusters of brand image attributes. Subsequent factor analysis identified three underlying dimensions - overall destination attractiveness, functionality, and ambience. While all three were correlated with perceived quality, commercial criteria were dominated by a destination's functional rather than ambience attributes.

T1  - Combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies in logistics research
AN  - 232593963
AB  - The majority of logistics research is primarily populated by quantitative research viewed through a positivist lens. Increasingly, there are calls for logistics research to more frequently employ qualitative methodologies. The trend in management research generally is increasingly to use methods and approaches which provide a middle ground between the contrasting positivist and phenomenological paradigms and perspectives. Methodological triangulation, using quantitative and qualitative methodologies, increasingly provides multidimensional insights into many management research problems. This paper urges logistics researchers to think about the paradigm through which they view the world and to explore the use of alternative methodologies. If the ultimate aim is to gain knowledge about the world then one needs to do this in the most valid way possible. This paper describes the dominant research paradigms and perspectives and their generally concomitant research methodologies and describes some research (decision-making concerning choice of ports/ferries) where methodological triangulation, using quantitative and qualitative methodologies, yielded greater insights than would have been the case if a single research methodology had been employed.

AB  - This article reports on the use of a repertory grid as a tool for studying conceptual systems in line with Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory. Using 7-point construct continua, students rated the positions of major developmental theorists on various bipolar constructs (e.g., nature-nurture, continuity-discontinuity) representing salient developmental issues. The results of objective testing, combined with the findings from a brief survey of students' attitudes toward repertory grid assignments, indicated that a repertory grid is a useful pedagogical strategy in terms of organizing course content, encouraging students' conceptual understanding, and challenging students intellectually. Moreover, when conjoined with the opportunity for classroom discussion, this technique stimulates active participation in the learning process.

T1  - The changes in ex-mental patients attending a psychiatric rehabilitation program with holistic care
AN  - 305051477
AB  - It is well documented that most patients with chronic mental illness suffer from severe psychosocial dysfunction. Recent studies also suggest many patients have spiritual problems. A review of the present psychiatric rehabilitation services in Hong Kong shows that it lacks structured rehabilitation programs especially the informal community programs in the form of self-help group (SHG). Furthermore, spiritual support is also neglected in most if not all of the psychiatric rehabilitation programs.    This research aims to study the changes and the related factors in ex-mental patients attending the psychiatric rehabilitation program with holistic care organized by a Christian non-government organization, which has successfully formed 12 SHGs within the past 10 years. This holistic care rehabilitation program is characterized by a SHG approach with a holistic care content in which spiritual support is much emphasized. Spiritual intervention is in the form of hymn singing, Bible reading, personal sharing and intercessions.    A mixed research method with three studies was adopted to examine the changes of the participants in the program. In the first study, a non-equivalent group design was used to measure the changes indexed by objective outcome indicators. A control group (N = 154) with no randomization but matched with the experimental group (N = 109) was used for comparison. In the second study, in-depth interviews with the participants (N = 20) were used to measure their subjective experiences in the group. In the third study, repertory grid tests based on 19 informants were used to measure the changes in terms of the self-identity system.   The findings in Study 1 showed that those who joined the SHG had more friends and more satisfaction socially than those without joining the group. Duration of attendance, religious and group involvement were three key factors related to the change of functioning of the group members. In Study 2, the subjective experiences of the participants were positive and they perceived positive changes in the group. SHG was also perceived as a useful means to reduce loneliness and enhance rehabilitation. The findings based on the repertory grid method in Study 3 showed that there were perceived positive changes in the self-identity system of the informants. They perceived themselves more similar to the ideal self and an ideal ex-mental patient while more dissimilar to an unsuccessful person.    An integration of findings from all three studies suggests that the program was beneficial to their participants in the physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects with dominant positive changes in the psychosocial dimension. The findings also underscore the therapeutic forces available in small groups and the positive effect of the long-term nature of SHG. Furthermore, the study indicates the importance of spiritual intervention and its therapeutic values in psychiatric rehabilitation.

T1  - Studies on information as an asset II: repertory grid
AN  - 224648638
AB  - This article presents findings from five repertory grid interviews conducted in early 2001 to identify attributes of information as an asset. Repertory grid is a technique developed by George Kelly based on his theory of personal constructs. Personal construct theory (PCT) assumes that individuals are their own `personal scientists' who mentally represent the world around them. The method was used to enable key senior executives in information-intensive UK organizations to identify attributes of information assets considered to be significant by them for their business. The findings are not intended to be representative, but give an insight into the thinking of these key executives and their approaches to managing information assets. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - (Rethinking) the measurement of service quality in museums and galleries
AN  - 236407147
AB  - Measurement of service quality has been instrumental in making service industries more competitive. The new era of accountability in the museum sector means that if museums and galleries are to be successful in growing visitor numbers and developing greater access, they must learn more about the factors that are important to visitors' evaluation of service quality. The aim of this study is to understand the concepts that are significant to visitors engaging in museum experiences. A repertory grid study was conducted among visitors to 11 prominent London museums; the results suggest that there is greater variety of factors influencing their decisions than is measured by traditional approaches to visitor satisfaction surveys.

T1  - Measuring brand associations for museums and galleries using repertory grid analysis
AN  - 212077349
AB  - This paper is a contribution to the literature on the branding of cultural institutions. In particular it focuses on visitor motivation in the field of museums and galleries. Measurement of visitor motivations and associated brand strength of cultural institutions is a relatively new concern for marketers. The need to develop further understanding of how best to market museums in the twenty-first century motivates this research. Repertory grid analysis was used as the survey method in order to get data that were "rich" in terms of concepts, but also malleable in terms of statistical analysis. The results of an exploratory study of museum brand associations are reported, along with a discussion of the method of repertory grid analysis that was used to obtain the data. A total of 11 museums in London were targeted, with a special focus on the Tate Gallery.

T1  - Career Problem Assessment: A Conceptual Schema for Counselor Training
AN  - 220426338
AB  - Counseling students learn about various theories, models, and career assessment measures during their training. However, the transition to practicum and internship often challenges students to decide on when to apply career theories and measures to specific problems. An assessment schema is proposed to assist counselor trainees with a systematic approach to conceptualizing a client's career problem. With this assessment schema, counselor educators can help trainees organize data into meaningful categories, reduce conceptual confusion, and engage students in the study of careers.

T1  - Why does subjectivity make us nervous? Making the tacit explicit
AN  - 205570501
AB  - Given the increasingly complex and uncertain environment in which contemporary organizations operate, there is a need for managers to embrace complexity and learn how to handle uncertainty. Management activity is, almost by definition, activity which takes place in the absence of standard operating procedures, and we have known for many years that managerial thinking (especially at the more senior levels) requires intuition and the exercise of subjective judgement in all organizations, not simply the entrepreneurial. A paper presents a coping system technique, and goes on to outline the theoretical background which provides it with a respectably solid foundation of principles.

T1  - Manufacturing change The role of performance evaluation and control systems
AN  - 232350894
AB  - This paper reports on research currently being undertaken into change in performance evaluation and control systems. Case study research involving the use of repertory grids, in-depth interviews, and observation has been undertaken to examine the impact of these systems on behavior and the potentially problematic nature of change in performance evaluation and control systems. This contrasts with previous research which has often assumed that such systems can be treated almost as easily manipulable independent variables. The case study illustrates the ways in which performance evaluation and control systems provide a formative context which means that change can be difficult to achieve and requires an understanding of the cultural assumptions underpinning both current and desired systems.

AB  - Operational research plays a major role in improving the profitability of British Airways (BA), which is the largest, and one of the most successful, international airlines in the world. This study explores the knowledge and facilitation conceptions held by operational research consultants in BA in supporting the decisions and management processes of their internal clients. Ten consultants, who were deemed experts in soft OR, were interviewed in order to examine the knowledge they used in helping their clients to manage decisions and change. The findings suggest that while the fundamental ethos of analytical rigor characterizes the worldview that the OR consultants adopt, it may be the modifications to techniques and practices that consultants make in intuitive and creative ways that secure their effectiveness.

T1  - Integrating teaching with other aspects of professorial work: a comparison of experienced and inexperienced faculty's role conceptualization
AN  - 221215729
AB  - Studies also shed some light on how faculty themselves see the relationship between research and teaching. After interviewing twelve professors holding an administrative position as head of their department at a British university, [Rowland] (1996) concludes "All those interviewed expressed a view that active involvement in the research process directly improved the quality of teaching" (p. 13). It seems worth noting that all twelve participants in Rowland's research had extensive experience as members of the professoriate and had reached the highest professorial rank. A recent U.S. study by Li-Ping Tang and Chamberlain (1997) also raises some interesting questions regarding the role of experience in faculty's perceptions of the relationships between research and teaching. These authors compared administrators' and faculty's attitudes towards teaching and research and report that administrators believe that research and teaching are mutually supportive. Faculty, on the other hand, believe that research interferes with teaching, and that they should be required to do either teaching or research, but not both. Interestingly, the sample of faculty consisted of 232 professors at different career stages, with 142 of these being at the rank of assistant and associate professor. Unfortunately, the survey results were not broken down by length of service or professorial rank, so it is unknown whether more experienced faculty might have shared a view of teaching and research that is similar to that of administration. However, the results of Li-Ping Tang and Chamberlain's (1997) and Rowland's (1998) studies indicate a need to further investigate the role of experience in how faculty perceive the relationships between teaching and research. This article reports on a study which investigated whether there are differences between experienced and inexperienced faculty in the extent to which they integrate their various professorial roles. These professorial roles were defined as teaching, research, plus service activities. My main purpose was to explore whether work-related experience may play a role in the development of an increasingly integrated view of professorial work.

              
Experienced faculty were found to integrate the various roles associated with professorial work more strongly than inexperienced faculty. Furthermore, when all activities associated with the teaching role were considered as a single variable, experienced faculty were found to integrate the teaching function more strongly with research and service activities than did their inexperienced peers. The two groups of faculty agreed the most on how they conceptualized the research activities while there was much more disagreement in relation to the other activities listed in the grid. Research was cited earlier that investigated faculty's perceptions of the relationship between teaching and research (Rowland, 1996; Li-Ping Tang & Chamberlain, 1997). In this context, I asked the question as to whether it might be that experienced faculty integrate the two important professorial roles more strongly than inexperienced faculty. The results of this study provide some first evidence to support this hypothesis. However, to what extent are these results attributable to work experience rather than to a sampling effect? The experienced group, after all, was purposively selected including only professors who demonstrated competence and interest in teaching, research, and presumably service work.

T1  - Using qualitative research to establish SME support needs
AN  - 213451207
AB  - SMEs are both users of marketing research and subjects of market research. There is clear evidence that the decision processes in such firms often render the products/services designed for medium and large firms in appropriate. One of the major suppliers of services to the small firms sector is the business support infrastructure. This includes agencies associated with business start-up/expansion and their management consultancy services concerning marketing, finance, insurance, and risk management. This paper considers the value of using in-depth qualitative research to establish the unique features of business support required by small firms. In addition to a review of recent studies that have adopted ethnographic, repertory grid and cognitive mapping qualitative approaches in this context, the paper presents the results from a specific study where the repertory grid procedure was used to establish the risk management practices of high technology firms.

T1  - Projecting the right image: using projective techniques to measure brand image
AN  - 213403789
AB  - Research has shown that consumers very often do not use explicit, concrete, rational factors to evaluate products, and thus their motivation to purchase is not always easy to articulate. Traditionally, marketers have used projective techniques in qualitative research groups to overcome this problem. This method is not infallible as each moderator brings his or her own style to discussions and subjective judgment to the interpretation of results, and it is practically impossible to replicate identically over time. This paper describes the development of a set of implicit characteristics for 2 animation sets to which respondents will respond similarly and with consistency, through which one can identify the brand image held and consequently the motivations behind brand choice.

T1  - Primary and secondary store-loyal customer perceptions of grocery retailers
AN  - 225143323
AB  - Gaining competitive advantage in retailing requires knowledge of the attributes consumers use to evaluate stores and an understanding of why these attributes are important. Although a number of store-image studies have identified store attributes, evidence suggests that these attributes vary by store type and over time, but no work has considered the most crucial aspects to retailers, namely store loyalty. As no study has examined the links between store attributes and store loyalty, the knowledge remains largely speculative. This article explores this link using Kelly's repertory grid methodology to assess the store images of three UK grocery retailers. Important differences were seen between primary store-loyal customers' perception of their store and secondary store-loyal customers' perception of that store. Implications for retail positioning strategies and the development of store loyalty are discussed.

AB  - Belbin's team role theories are evaluated in terms of the claim that high team performance is associated with teams that are balanced in terms of the team roles represented among team members.  Eleven teams from a mixture of private and public organizations were surveyed to test the proposition that a balanced team will be a high performing team and vice versa.  Issues of measurement of team balance and team performance are addressed.  The research is believed to be unique in including a number of criteria for team role balance rather than the single, simplistic measure frequently used.  An innovative measure of team performance is used.  The results of the investigation give some support to the link Belbin makes between team role balance and team performance.  These are discussed in the light of the paucity of rigorous research in this area to date.

T1  - Customer perceptions of service operations: Gestalt, incident or mythology?
AN  - 203354878; 01481211
AB  - It is proposed that scaled perceptions of service quality, such as those elicited by Likert scale questionnaires, are influenced by 2 principal factors.  Noteworthy incidents occurring during the service experience affect perceptions in a largely random way.  In addition, commonly held perceptions of different types of service establishment provide a basis upon which perceptions are built.  These perceptions may be regarded as mythologies: generalizations or exaggerated versions of reality expressed in similar terms by a group of individuals.  Statistical analysis of data obtained from a SERVQUAL-style questionnaire administered to 234 restaurant customers indicated a high level of randomness among scaled perceptions, suggesting the influence of incidents upon perceptions.  In addition, 10 individuals who had filled out questionnaires underwent in-depth interviews in order to discover the basis of the perception scores they had provided.  The results suggest that service incidents play the most obvious part in perception formation, but there is also evidence of mythologies at work.

AB  - Numerous computerized repertory grid programs are available to researchers and clinicians; however, these programs operate in a DOS environment, and many are cumbersome to use.  Baldwin et al introduce the first Windows-based repertory grid program, making the analysis of repertory grids easier and thus more useful for researchers and practitioners in the behavioral sciences.

T1  - Performance issues in U.S.-China joint ventures
AN  - 216139221; 01205295
AB  - An in-depth study of US-China joint ventures offers some insights into the performance of such international business relationships.  While the conventional literature treats government as an amorphous aspect of the political-legal environment, in this case government is an active participant and influence in the performance of international joint ventures (IJV).  It has both a constraining and enabling effect on IJV structure, strategy, and performance.  For example, limits can be placed on ownership shares of joint ventures and on prices of the output.  At the same time, government can cooperate with IJV's and foreign parent companies by creating partners for foreign parent companies, acting as major customers, and improving financial performance by lowering taxes.

T1  - Information search and efficiency of consumer choices of new cars: Country-of-origin effects
AN  - 224313150; 01148868
AB  - Country-of-origin (CO) studies have traditionally focused on consumer product evaluations which are presumed to occur during the evaluation of alternative stages of the consumer buying decision process, where knowledge about product attribute information is either provided or assumed.  The CO effects are examined by incorporating the amount of prepurchase information search and the post-purchase efficiency of choice measured by the amount of loss buyers incur for not choosing the same or higher quality car at a lower price.  It is shown that while CO did not affect the amount of pre-purchase search, it had a significant impact on the efficiency of consumer choices.

AB  - A three-phase study to validate and redesign the graduate assessment centers used by ICL is described.  The results by multimethod multitrait correlation matrix and inter-correlating ratings of dimensions both across and within exercises are analyzed.  Differences between the hired and rejected groups are evaluated by discriminant function analysis.  The predictive validity is assessed by multiple regression analysis on the performance ratings and salary information.  The redesign of the recruitment procedure to select for future competencies as well as present requirements is discussed.

T1  - Gender, diversity and working styles
AN  - 213150619; 00848971
AB  - Evidence from a research study into the impact of gender on management styles is presented using repertory grid as a methodology.  Generalized differences were identified in the approaches of women and men to definition of the job, overall style, decision making, and interpersonal relationships.  Men had greater visibility to other men, while a broader insight was offered by women interviewees into the women managers' approaches.  In the context of patriarchal power relations, in which masculinity is defined as opposite and superior to femininity, feminine working styles are perceived as less effective in organizations, while masculine attributes tend to be regarded as normatively the way to manage.  Such values can imbue recruitment, selection, and development practices with gender bias.  Recent management and leadership theory has advocated the value of a people-centered approach, which traditionally and stereotypically has been associated with women.  There is a need to be alert to a redefinition of patriarchal relations as men seek to maintain status.

T1  - STRATEGIC GROUPS: A COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE
AN  - 231136731
AB  - The strategic group concept provides an attractive middle ground between firm and industry for both theory development and empirical analysis. To date, this concept has been defined by researchers in terms of secondary accounting and financial data, and a number of critics have questioned the validity of this work. Our research shows that industry participants share perceptions about strategic commonalities among firms, and that participants cluster competitors in subtle ways not reflected in extant academic research on strategic groups. Decision makers' perceptions and cognitions are phenomena that can be expected to influence industry evolution. They are of research interest as an additional source of data on firm commonalities which helps address concerns about previous strategic group research.
