T1  - Making it tangible: hybrid card sorting within qualitative interviews
AN  - 2183084518
AB  - PurposeQualitative researchers and information practitioners often investigate questions that probe the underlying mental models, nuanced perspectives, emotions and experiences of their target populations. The in-depth qualitative interview is a dominant method for such investigations and the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how incorporating hybrid card-sorting activities into interviews can enable deeper participant reflections and generate rich data sets to increase understanding.Design/methodology/approachFollowing a review of relevant literature, the case illustration presented is a grounded theory study into the student-researcher information experience with personal academic information management. This study uses hybrid card sorting within in-depth, semi-structured interviews, a unique adaptation that extends multi-disciplinary awareness of the benefits of card-sort exercises for qualitative research.FindingsEmerging from diverse fields, ranging from computer science, engineering, psychology and human–computer interaction, card sorting seeks to illuminate how participants understand and organise concepts. The case illustration draws largely on methods used in interaction design and information architecture. Using either open or fixed designs, or hybrid variations, card-sort activities can make abstract concepts more tangible for participants, offering investigators a new approach to interview questions with the aid of this interactive, object-based technique.Originality/valueOpening with a comprehensive review of card-sort studies, the authors present an information experience case illustration that demonstrates the rich data generated by hybrid card sorting within qualitative interviews, or interactive interviews. This is followed by discussion of the types of research questions that may benefit from this original method.

T1  - Beyond Unidimensionality: Segmenting Contemporary Pro-Environmental Worldviews Through Surveys and Repertory Grid Analysis
AN  - 2122683742
AB  - Environmental organizations have become increasingly interested in identifying groups in the general population that understand scientific issues in an internally cohesive way. However segmenting these groups empirically is contingent on employing metrics with high levels of reliability and validity, and many existing metrics are dated or make assumptions about what constitutes pro-environmental attitudes. This research project explores the heterogeneous worldviews of a non-random sample of contemporary environmentalists. Through the use of surveys and repertory grid interviews, research participants were differentiated into sub-groups based on their attitudes towards nature's resilience, locus of control, catastrophism, and faith in technology. While cognizant of the potentially instrumentalist nature of audience segmentations, this study is descriptive rather than normative. As environmental organizations seek to communicate science more effectively, this study reveals how subgroups of environmentalists make sense of existing problems and challenges and why recognizing these differences can facilitate progress in achieving social change goals.

T1  - The Experience of Being a Qualified Female BME Clinical Psychologist in a National Health Service: An Interpretative Phenomenological and Repertory Grid Analysis
AN  - 2029510523
AB  - This study explores the lived experience of black and minority ethnic (BME) clinical psychologists employed in the U.K. National Health Service (NHS). A mixed method qualitative approach was employed using repertory grids and interpretative phenomenological analysis. Six female BME clinical psychologists took part. Four master themes emerged from the analysis, including standing out as different, negotiating cultural and professional values, sitting with uncertainty, and feeling proud to be a clinical psychologist. The repertory grid analysis supported these findings and enriched the study. Implications of the study are discussed-namely, the importance of the profession increasing the cultural competency and sensitivity of its members as well as becoming more diverse.

T1  - Neuropsychodynamic Approach to Depression: Integrating Resting State Dysfunctions of the Brain and Disturbed Self-Related Processes
AN  - 2287062585
AB  - A mechanism-based approach was developed focusing on the psychodynamic, psychological, and neuronal mechanisms in healthy and depressed persons. In this integrative concept of depression, the self is a core dimension in depression. It is attributed to negative emotions (e.g. failure, guilt). The increased inward focus in depression is connected with a decreased environmental focus. The development of neuropsychodynamic hypotheses of the altered self-reference is based on the investigation of the emotional-cognitive interaction in depressed patients. It may be hypothesized that the increased negative self-attributions – as typical characteristics of an increased self-focus in depression – may result from altered neuronal activity in subcortical-cortical midline structures in the brain, especially from hyperactivity in the cortical-subcortical midline regions and hypoactivity in the lateral regions. The increased resting state activity in depression is especially associated with an increased resting state activity in the default mode network (DMN) and a dysbalance between default mode network and executive network (EN) activity. Possible therapeutic consequences of the neuropsychodynamic approach to depression involve the necessary emotional attunement in psychotherapy of depressed patients and the adequate timing of therapeutic interventions. The hypotheses which have been developed in the context of the neuropsychodynamic model of depression may be used for more specific psychotherapeutic interventions, aiming at specific mechanisms of compensation and defence, which are related to the increased resting state activity and the disturbed resting state-stimulus-interaction.

T1  - Impacts of integrating the repertory grid into an augmented reality-based learning design on students' learning achievements, cognitive load and degree of satisfaction
AN  - 2006846422
AB  - Augmented reality (AR) offers potential advantages for intensifying environmental context awareness and augmenting students' experiences in real-world environments by dynamically overlapping digital materials with a real-world environment. However, some challenges to AR learning environments have been described, such as participants' cognitive overload and the ways to provide assistance in constructing the presented learning materials. In this study, a mindtool-based AR learning system was developed, based on the repertory grid method and the contiguity principle of multimedia learning, for assisting students in constructing their knowledge in a natural science course. Furthermore, an experiment was carried out on an elementary school natural science course to compare the influences of this method with those of the conventional AR learning system on students' learning effectiveness. The experimental results show that the designated approach effectively promoted the students' learning achievements, and no significant difference existed between the mindtool-based AR learning system and the conventional AR learning system in terms of students' cognition load and satisfaction degree; moreover, both the experimental group and the control group perceived low cognition load during the learning activity and rated their own AR learning systems as being highly satisfactory.

T1  - EXPERIENTIAL QUALITY AMONG COFFEE LOVERS: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY IN THE MALAYSIAN COFFEE OUTLETS INDUSTRY
AN  - 2287891636
AB  - Experiential Quality has become extremely important for coffee outlets industry due to the highly competitive environment. The main objective of this study is to analyze the quality of the coffee outlets to win more customers in Malaysia. This study specifically design to investigate the existing literature on experiential quality comprising Interaction quality, Physical environment quality, Outcome quality and Affective quality. Researcher used a self-administrated questionnaire survey with a sample size of 200 respondents from various coffee outlets in Selangor, Malaysia (One of the state with high population in Malaysia). The Findings shows that Interaction quality, Physical environment quality, and Outcome quality have direct effect on experimental quality among coffee lovers. Affective quality shows an negative effect on experiential quality. Coffee is one of the global product. Coffee sold at branded coffee outlets are niche market product. Coffee outlets industry is a classified destination of consumers with intrinsic value of coffee. Coffee outlets offer typical coffer qualities in attractive environment to withhold coffee lovers. This special product is consumed by middle income and higher income social class consumers. The findings further implied coffee outlets focused at managing coffee lovers' service quality expectation to create and enlarge greater coffee loyalist for sustainable competitive advantage.

T1  - FUNIFICATION 2.0: KNOWLEDGE MOBILIZATION MODEL FOR CORPORATE AND EDUCATIONAL GAME-BASED LEARNING
AN  - 1882360055
AB  - Purpose              The purpose of this paper is to review the concepts of "fun and play" and propose a preliminary model that suggests potential benefits for quantitatively/qualitatively rating serious games and simulations associated with corporate and university game-based learning (GBL).              Design/methodology/approach              A relevant literature review was executed to locate significant references to fun and play, assessment of GBL, and the pattern for integrating those elements with knowledge mobilization (KMb). A repertory grid method (RGM) was used to propose a preliminary model.              Findings              The proposed FUNIFICATION Model will be useful as a foundation for further evaluation of GBL environments.              Research limitations/implications              Additional rationalization of the proposed model and applying it to actual games with focus groups as the observers would provide additional validity to the new model.              Practical implications              A threshold for fun involved in serious games and simulations would provide a quantitative/qualitative measure for playability of serious games and simulations. The FUNIFICATION Factor would feed into a KMb model for acquiring, codifying, disseminating, and making knowledge actionable, either within academic, corporate, or public sector environments.              Originality/value              The range of assessment models for GBL is evident from the literature review, and value could be derived in building an evaluation model based upon the RGM to identify a FUNIFICATION Factor for serious games and simulations.

T1  - How Do Allied Health Professionals Construe the Role of the Remote Workforce? New Insight into Their Recruitment and Retention
AN  - 1845256757
AB  - Purpose 
Allied health workforce recruitment and retention in remote areas is a global problem. Using case studies from the Australian allied health workforce, this paper adds new information by combining personality trait information with a detailed understanding of how the cases construe the demands of remote work, which may be useful in addressing this problem.
 Methods 
Four cases (two urban, two remote) are presented from a mixed methods study (n = 562), which used (1) the Temperament and Character Inventory to investigate personality traits of allied health professionals; and (2) repertory grid interviews to reveal quantitatively and qualitatively how the cases construed their Ideal work role compared with their Current and a Remote role. Cases also self-assessed their fit (‘suited’ or ‘not suited’) with remote.
 Findings 
Differences in the way cases construed their fit with remote work was related to prior experience. However all were satisfied with their work, perceiving their Current role as similar to their Ideal. All saw remote work as requiring generalist expertise and a reliance on relationships. Personality traits, especially Novelty Seeking and Harm Avoidance, fit with how allied health professionals perceived their role.
 Conclusions 
The combination of two distinct lines of investigation, illustrates what more can be revealed about allied health professional’s career choices by taking into account the fit or lack of fit between their personality tendencies, their construing of remote work and their life circumstances. Understanding the combined influence of perceptions and traits on an individual toward or away from remote work may enhance recruitment and retention internationally.

T1  - A critical review of research on customer experience management
AN  - 1827863571
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of research on customer experience management (CEM). The objectives are as follows. The paper first introduces the concepts involved in CEM by identifying definitions and dimensions of the customer experience. Second, the paper describes the evolution of CEM research from a theoretical perspective in generic businesses and then in the hospitality and tourism (H&T) sector. Third, the paper investigates the methodological approaches used in CEM research and addresses the challenges in measuring the customer experience. Fourth, this study addresses cultural issues in CEM research. The identification of gaps in CEM research in the general business and H&T sectors leads the authors to consider directions for future research. Managerial implications are also provided.Design/methodology/approachThe paper takes the form of a review of the extant literature in the general businesses and the H&T industry.FindingsDespite the emergence of CEM as a vital research area, a large portion of its studies remain conceptual, which indicates that further empirical investigations are necessary. Importantly, the uniquely experiential nature of H&T products/services calls for systematic, theory-driven research. The paper identifies future research topics, which include total customer experience, transcendent experience, transformational experience, authentic experience and the co-creation of experience. This study delineates potential methods and measurement scales that can be used in CEM research and some challenges in the development of future measurement scales of customer experience. Recognizing a lack of CEM research from a cultural perspective, this paper calls for future studies that consider cultural factors in the identification of the underlying reasons for various perceptions of experiences.Practical implicationsCompanies need to take a holistically integrated approach to creating a memorable experience in which multidimensional value can be delivered through multiple, sequential stages of experience. The co-creation of experience can lead to a sustainable experience that can be life transforming or perspective transforming.Originality/valueAcknowledging the importance of excellent CEM in the contemporary H&T industry, this paper provides a compilation of literature on CEM and offers a foundation for advancing future CEM research in the H&T industry.

T1  - A New Development to Aid Interpretation of Hierarchical Cluster Analysis of Repertory Grid Data
AN  - 1808758920
AB  - Hierarchical clustering is a common way to analyze repertory grid data, as it allows visual identification of homogeneous groups of elements and constructs. This article explores a bootstrap approach to clustering that additionally allows significance testing of dendrogram structures. Given that the choice of the specific clustering method and distance measure can be justified, the method yields indications of closely related element or construct structures. Closely integrated groups of constructs link to the concept of cognitive complexity. Several new complexity indexes are derived from the bootstrap solution. The behavior of the indexes is compared (a) across the most common clustering methods and distance measures and (b) to standard complexity measures. The derived measures reflect a different aspect of complexity than standard measures.

T1  - Dementia-specific quality of life instruments: a conceptual analysis
AN  - 1809162611
AB  - Background:

              
Over the past 20 years, many researchers have worked in developing various methods for measuring quality of life (QoL) of people with dementia. The aim of this review is to develop the conceptual frameworks of the dementia-specific QoL instruments, to identify their evolution over time and to provide elements of reflection on the QoL concept in dementia and its evaluation.

              
Methods:

              
An electronic search was conducted on PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases, from January 1985 to June 2015 using a combination of key words that include QoL, dementia, and review.

              
Results:

              
The analysis of the conceptual frameworks of the 18 selected dementia-specific QoL tools shows a great diversity in: (1) the QoL definitions (e.g. health-related QoL definitions, QoL definitions based on Lawton's work, or similar to this latter); (2) the theoretical QoL models (e.g. Lawton' work and modified Lawton, adaptation, personhood); (3) the domains and dimensions; (4) the way to construct the instrument (e.g. development based on literature, opinion of the experts), and (5) the items' formulation (e.g. use of criterion of intensity or frequency).

              
Conclusions:

              
There are different conceptual frameworks in the dementia-specific QoL measures with improvements over time (e.g. inclusion of interesting concepts such as adaptation, taking into account the views of patients themselves). Each of the conceptual parameters (definitions, models, domains, and dimensions) is discussed to identify the scales that are conceptually the strongest. Through their review, recommendations for future instrument refinement and development are discussed and a new QoL definition is proposed.

T1  - Product Management - Towards a framework of key activities and priorities
AN  - 1781345775
AB  - The importance of Product Management is widely accepted, particularly within the technology sector. However, not enough is known about the key activities of Product Managers and how these are prioritised. This paper sets out to explore and map the role through the lens of product management activities, spanning external market and cross-departmental constituencies. Using depth interviews, the research attempts to map the activities and the management priorities that drive them. The fine-grained nature of the results may be of practical use to managers and practitioners seeking to define the product management function more clearly and also to better understand the factors that drive prioritization and thus impact the managerial salience of the role. Also, it may help researchers better understand the subtleties of the interface between product management and the strategic management of the firm.

This study developed a novel peer assessment system from the approach of knowledge engineering. Gathering information from experts, a dynamic repertory grid was created as a peer assessment form to be used in a computer skills class taught in a vocational school. This form is dynamic in that it allows student reviewers to select personalized assessment criteria from a bank of items, causing students to reflect on the purpose of the assignment being reviewed and how to best characterize the performance of the student completing the assignment as well as providing ample feedback for students. The results compared the performance of the students using the proposed system with that of the ones using conventional approaches, and found that those who applied the proposed approach learned better and made significant improvement.

As RS (recommendation system) presents the advantage of adaptive recommendation, it is gradually applied to e-learning systems to recommend learners for the next learning content. Problems exist in current learning recommender system available to student in that they are often of a general learning content not offering a personalized service. To overcome this, An adaptive learning path recommendation system (ALPRS) is proposed comprising: (a) Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) is applied to acquire the key factors in learning content; (b) Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) is further utilized for establishing the adaptive learning path hierarchical structure; and (c) repertory grid technology (RGT) is further used for acquiring the effects of the recommender element attributes of the adaptive learning path. The result show that the learning outcome with ALPRS is better than it with general learning course guided recommendation mechanism, and the scores of system satisfaction with ALPRS and personal service are higher than 90; recall (95%), precision (68%), F1 index (45%), and MAE (8%) in ALPRS outperform other approaches. Finally, three contributions are organized in this study. (1) The novel hybrid ALPRS is proposed and tested the practicability. (2) A prototype gamification geometry teaching material module is developed for the promotion in MSTE (Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education) areas. (3) The adaptive geometry learning path diagram generated with ISM based on learning styles could offer reference for successive studies.

This paper reports on a study of the design, development and evaluation of two teaching analytics dashboards that visualize students' repertory grid exercise data. The technical objective of the dashboards is to support teachers to investigate and compare personal constructs and element ratings by students for given topics of study at the individual student, group or classroom levels of analysis. The pedagogical objective of the dashboards is to facilitate formative assessment feedback to students and feed-forward refinements to ongoing instructional practices. The teaching analytics dashboards were evaluated with six university teachers in a bio-metric usability study with integrated physiological and performance measures. Eye-tracking data from the two dashboards showed the relative importance of dashboard areas in each case in terms of aggregate gaze allocation. Findings informed the iterative design of the dashboards leading to teachers not being adversely affected by the visual clutter of the less important dashboard areas in their pedagogical decision-making. The results also showed that the dashboards were efficient and effective from a task performance perspective and were rated to be pleasant from a subjective satisfaction perspective. Regarding education technology innovation, teachers reported that such dashboards are lacking in their regular practice and would recommend their use in formal business educational settings.

T1  - All at sea – gender and leadership in Britain’s Royal Navy (RN)
AN  - 2085704190
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to investigate the relationship between leadership and gender in the UK’s Royal Navy (RN) to answer the research question “Do men and women lead in different ways?”. Design/methodology/approach – The research collected factual data on personnel statistics and organisational structure in the RN. The primary research adopted a grounded theory approach using repertory grid and critical incident technique. The research design was to interview a snowball sample of 27 mid-ranking officers, equally split between men and women and drawn from the main branches in the RN. Findings – There is a significant gender deficit in the RN officer cadre with no women senior-ranking RN officers currently in post. A model of RN leadership was developed from a content and statistical analysis of the primary data. This was broadly equivalent for both men and women, except in one regard: women are expected to manage the impact of their gender so that their self-presentation conforms to the prevailing androcentric norms. The analysis also identified the consequences of unreflective leadership for followers and developed the term “damagement” to conceptualise this. Research limitations/implications – The small-scale research design precluded any generalisable findings, but further research, if confirmatory, should make a substantive contribution to both the theoretical field of gender and leadership, and the practice of leadership in the RN. Practical implications – These would relate the practice of leadership in the RN. Given further confirmatory research, the findings should inform the leadership selection, training and evaluation processes operated by the RN. It should also influence the Ministry of Defence’s policy on the wider deployment of women in the armed services, when the issue is next reviewed. Social implications – The research may have social implications for the wider acceptance of the valuable contribution that women can and should be making in the national armed services of the UK and beyond. Originality/value – The research was primary. It has added value though both its contribution to the leadership and gender debate and also the conceptualisation of leadership in the armed services, particularly the RN. In addition, it developed a new concept, that of “damagement” that could be critical in the development of more effective leadership styles.

T1  - From requirements elicitation to variability analysis using repertory grid: A cognitive approach

The growing complexity and dynamics of the execution environment have been major motivation for designing self-adaptive systems. Although significant work can be found in the field of formalizing or modeling the requirements of adaptive system, not enough attention has been paid towards the requirements elicitation techniques for the same. It is still an open challenge to elicit the users' requirements in the light of various contexts and introduce the required flexibility in the system's behavior at an early phase of requirements engineering. We explore the idea of using a cognitive technique, repertory grid, to acquire the knowledge of various stakeholders along multiple dimensions of problem space and design space. We aim at discovering the scope of variations in the features of the system by capturing the intentional and technical variability in the problem space and design space respectively. A stepwise methodology for finding the right set of features in the changing context has also been provided in this work. We evaluate the proposed idea by a preliminary case study using smart home system domain.

T1  - An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis and Repertory Grid Exploration of Anger in Young Offenders
AN  - 1660663972
AB  - Anger and its treatment is a major issue in a variety of contexts, although it remains underexplored. In this study 10 young people completed semi-structured interviews and repertory grids. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and repertory grid analysis were conducted. Findings consistently indicated that anger is a more similar than different experience for participants within dialectical processes involving disempowering, empowering, and disengaging narratives that can be affected by positive personal and interpersonal phenomena and socially driven beliefs. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

T1  - Relationships Among Self, Others, and Persecutors in Individuals With Persecutory Delusions: A Repertory Grid Analysis
AN  - 1497037603
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to examine the way individuals with persecutory delusions construe the self, others, and their main persecutor with reference to the constructs of malevolence and omnipotence, and examine the extent to which these interpersonal beliefs link to distress, self-esteem, and delusion conviction. Repertory grid methodology was used to explore interpersonal beliefs about malevolence and omnipotence in a sample (N = 30) of individuals with current persecutory delusions (mean age 36.4 years; 62% male and 53% White). Participants also completed measures of emotional distress (depression and anxiety) and self-esteem. The findings suggested that persecutors were construed as more omnipotent and malevolent than both the self and others; others in turn were construed as more omnipotent and malevolent than the self. Beliefs about self as powerful were associated with lower anxiety, depression, and higher self-esteem, and beliefs about persecutors' omnipotence predicted delusion conviction. As with voices, the concepts of power/omnipotence and malevolence/benevolence appear to be important constructs when seeking to understand the relationship between individuals and their perceived persecutors. These findings support working therapeutically with negative schematic beliefs about self, others, and persecutors, which is consistent with a person-based cognitive therapy model of distressing psychosis.

T1  - Lecturers' and students' conceptions of authenticity in teaching and actual teacher actions and attributes students perceive as helpful
AN  - 1442928158
AB  - This study investigated an under-explored area in the field of academic practice: the meaning of the complex notion of authenticity in teaching. Combining conceptual with empirical investigation, data included philosophical texts, repertory grid interviews with fifty-five lecturers and students from Law, Physics and English Literature, and fourteen focus groups with forty-six students. Philosophical conceptions were compared to those held by students and lecturers. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of repertory grids revealed differences in experts'/philosophers' and lay-people's conceptions of authenticity and additionally showed how lecturers' and students' conceptions of authenticity in teaching differed from their conceptions of teaching effectiveness. Focus groups identified linkages between authenticity in teaching and actual teacher actions and attributes that students perceive as being conducive to their learning. The findings enhance the meaning of authenticity, show how it matters in university teaching and offer a hitherto lacking theoretical foundation for further research.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Beyond Kansei Engineering: The Emancipation of Kansei Design
AN  - 1432506434
AB  - For over three decades, kansei engineering has expanded greatly and has become a significant discipline both in the industrial and the academic worlds. In this paper, I present the current situation of kansei engineering, and plead for the emancipation of other disciplines, as part of kansei research as well. By reconstructing the historical path of kansei research and exploring the variety of disciplines within kansei research, I point out the opportunities for kansei design to emerge. Whereas kansei engineering and kansei science have found their roots in scientifically established approaches (respectively engineering and brain science), kansei design intends to return to earlier Japanese philosophical or cultural works to rediscover the essence of kansei, and to use them as inspirational means for design. This new discipline certainly needs to be elaborated further. Therefore, this paper aims to contribute to the elaboration of a more expansive point-of-view in design research regarding the relationship between human beings and their immediate environment.

T1  - Perceptions of charities and the ultimate gift: the use of the Repertory Test to elicit salient bequest decision criteria
AN  - 1041314658
AB  - This paper reports a practitioner/academic collaboration that sought to identify the attributes salient in the decision-making process of individuals considering a charitable bequest in Australia. Philanthropy scholars concur that bequest making behaviour is generally not well understood or researched and is fertile terrain for new enquiry. They urge scholars and practitioners to integrate learning from other relevant disciplines to reveal new insights and understandings into why so many individuals elect to make a testamentary gift to a charity in their will or other planned giving instrument. This research draws on the branding literature; and effectively trialed the use of Kelly's (1955) Repertory Test from clinical psychology, the results of which will provide researchers and charity marketing practitioners with an enhanced understanding of bequest decision criteria.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - User Experience in Mobile Phones by Using Semantic Differential Methodology
AN  - 1326437857
AB  - Measuring overall UX is a challenging process because of its versatile nature. Studies showed that hundreds of thousands of products are returned each year not because of its functional behaviour but because of its bad user experience. Researchers and practitioners use different techniques and methods to capture the customer psychological and behavioural aspects towards a product and to put it into design so that the future product form must be in according to his/her expectations. In this paper a research work is carried out to evaluate user experience evaluation methodologies and to identify a method which can be used efficiently to measure the overall user experience of a product use from user experience using mobile phone as a case. As overall user experience constitutes both the experiential as well as non-experiential aspects of a product. Hence semantic differential methodology is identified as a best suited method based on current user experience evaluation methodologies and later on used to measure preference from the overall user experience which can be used to improve product form to ensure customer loyalty.

T1  - A review of the uses of the Kelly's Repertory Grid method in educational assessment and comparability research studies
AN  - 1022704305
AB  - Comparability between different educational qualifications is an important issue within policy discourse in the UK. In this context, the comparability of qualification demands has been explored through the use of expert human judgement. The involvement of human judgement in estimating assessment demands has consequences for methodology. This review considered the ways that the Kelly's Repertory Grid (KRG) technique has been used to compare assessment demands over recent years. The review involved the identification and analysis of research documents as well as consideration of the original theory on which the KRG method was founded. This article describes how the technique has been adapted as it has shifted from its original psychotherapeutic context to be used in educational assessment and comparability studies. The review also explored possible disadvantages that stem from these adaptations, leading to recommendations to ensure the validity of findings when using the technique in educational assessment studies.

T1  - Apply of the Theory of Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation to the Middle-Level Manager's Organizational Identification in Construction Trades
AN  - 1442999235
AB  - Shaping and strengthening the middle-level manager's organizational identification in construction trades, which can make the organization become an important part of their self concept and be willing to become a common destiny with the enterprise, can win core competitiveness for the enterprise's sustainable development. Based on depth interview, aided by the nvivo8 software, the paper uses grounded theory to set up the evaluation index system of middle-level managers' organizational identification in construction trades. The weight of each index is assigned by analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model of middle-level manager's organizational identification in construction trades is constructed.

T1  - A pilot study on conducting mobile learning activities for clinical nursing courses based on the repertory grid approach
AN  - 904536884
AB  - In clinical nursing courses, students are trained to identify the status of the target patients. The mastery of such ability and skills is very important since patients frequently need to be cared for immediately. In this pilot study, a repertory grid-oriented clinical mobile learning system is developed for a nursing training program. With the assistance of the mobile learning system, the nursing school students are able to learn in an authentic learning scenario, in which they can physically face the target patients, with the personal guidance and supplementary materials from the learning system to support them. To show the effectiveness of this innovative approach, an experiment has been conducted on the "respiratory system" unit of a nursing course. The experimental results show that the innovative approach is helpful to students in improving their learning achievements. Moreover, from the questionnaire surveys, it was found that most students showed favorable attitudes toward the usage of the mobile learning system and their participation in the training program.

T1  - Exploring the Promise of Eudaimonic Well-Being Within the Practice of Health Promotion: The "How" is as Important as the "What"
AN  - 889504051
AB  - A brief historical and philosophical analysis suggests that the biomedical model and prevention have been the pillars of health promotion practices with the underlying assumption that these concepts provide answers to people's health woes. Another observation resulting from this analysis is that biomedical, prevention, and more recently, wellness, do not differ much from each other paradigmatically (e.g., instrumental rationality) and, hence, are severely restricted in their short- and long-term effectiveness for helping people with healthy living and quality of life. It is proposed that eudaimonic well-being--if explored, understood, and implemented in a manner that holds true to the purity of the concept--offers significant promise for shifts in health promotion practices that may lead to transformative health experiences and enhanced quality of life.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Important characteristics of software development team members: an empirical investigation using Repertory Grid
AN  - 1766831288
AB  - An information system is typically developed by a team of information systems (IS) professionals. Research shows that teams staffed with the right people are more likely to be effective and efficient. There is a paucity of study that examines the important traits of IS professionals in team contexts. The objective of this research is to identify and understand the important characteristics of good team members in software development projects. We applied an established psychological technique (Repertory Grid) to guide our interviews with 21 experienced IS professionals, who have had extensive experience in software development teams. The comprehensive list of important characteristics was analysed qualitatively using open coding method of grounded theory. Fifty-nine unique characteristics were identified and classified into eight categories. Among them, attitude/motivation, knowledge, interpersonal/communication skills, and working/cognitive ability were perceived by research participants to be the most important categories. Our study provides a context-specific (i.e. software development team) evaluation of important characteristics of IS professionals. The results have significant implications for IS recruiting, IS training, IS staffing, and IS human resource management. Our study also supplements the research on management of IS development teams.

T1  - An overview of Indian research in schizophrenia
AN  - 762299280
AB  - The Indian Journal of Psychiatry published three articles in its first issue way back in 1958. Since then, it has steadily published more than 200 papers on one or the other aspect of schizophrenia. From rudimentary research methodology and descriptive approach, schizophrenia research, as published in the Journal, seems to have come of age with more and more sophisticated research designs and methodologies. Our ardent researchers have made significant contributions in the understanding of this riddle called schizophrenia. Notable contributions have been made in the field of epidemiology, course and outcomes and phenomenology of this disorder. However, research in psycho-social rehabilitation of schizophrenia and related areas is sparse and sporadic. The need to conduct research that impacts health policies and planning of services for this disorder is evident and our researchers would do well to provide impetus in these areas.

T1  - Open Profiling of Quality: A Mixed Method Approach to Understanding Multimodal Quality Perception
AN  - 855471185
AB  - To quantify the excellence of multimedia quality, subjective evaluation experiments are conducted. In these experiments, the tradition of quantitative assessment is the most dominating, but it disregards the understanding of participants' interpretations, descriptions, and the evaluation criteria of quality. The goal of this paper is to present a new multimedia quality evaluation method called Open Profiling of Quality (OPQ) as a tool for building a deeper understanding on subjective quality. OPQ is a mixed method combining a conventional quantitative psychoperceptual evaluation and qualitative descriptive quality evaluation based on the individual's own vocabulary. OPQ is targeted for naïve participants applicable to experiments with heterogeneous and multimodal stimulus material. The paper presents the theoretical basis of the development of OPQ and overviews the methods for audiovisual quality research. We present three extensive quality evaluation studies where OPQ has been used with 120 participants. Finally, we conclude further recommendations of use of the method in quality evaluation research.

AB  - O comportamento organizacional está associado à tomada de decisão estratégica adotada por agentes indutores internos, considerados estrategistas. Esse comportamento leva a organização a buscar melhor desempenho em posições de mercado e no uso de recursos tangíveis e intangíveis. Este trabalho propõe avançar no entendimento de como esses agentes atuam na formulação de estratégias, elaboram heurísticas, conduzem os negócios nessa busca por melhor desempenho. Para tanto, adotou-se o método RepGrid (Kelly, 1955) aplicado a proprietários de pequenas e médias empresas (PMEs) em uma região produtora de calçados de Nova Serrana - MG. Os resultados identificaram os fatores de atenção dos agentes na elaboração de estratégias, os quais centralizam a decisão no dirigente e em seus sócios; baseiam-se em resultados financeiros; avaliam tanto as questões internas atuais quanto as externas de mercado; e conduzem um processo emergente e pouco formalizado.

T1  - IT project managers' construction of successful project management practice: a repertory grid investigation
AN  - 198289209
AB  - Although effective project management is critical to the success of information technology (IT) projects, little empirical research has investigated skill requirements for IT project managers (PMs). This study addressed this gap by asking 19 practicing IT PMs to describe the skills that successful IT PMs exhibit. A semi-structured interview method known as the repertory grid (RepGrid) technique was used to elicit these skills. Nine skill categories emerged: client management, communication, general management, leadership, personal integrity, planning and control, problem solving, systems development and team development. Our study complements existing research by providing a richer understanding of several skills that were narrowly defined (client management, planning and control, and problem solving) and by introducing two new skill categories that had not been previously discussed (personal integrity and team development). Analysis of the individual RepGrids revealed four distinct ways in which study participants combined skill categories to form archetypes of effective IT PMs. We describe these four IT PM archetypes - General Manager, Problem Solver, Client Representative and Balanced Manager - and discuss how this knowledge can be useful for practitioners, researchers and educators. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.

T1  - Increasing Entrepreneurial Intentions through Innovations in Pedagogy: European Approaches, Programmes, and Tools
AN  - 192411614
AB  - As a reaction to the positive effects of entrepreneurship, many universities try to enhance students' entrepreneurial mindsets. Based on existing evaluations of entrepreneurship education, this paper focuses on European innovative pedagogy for classroom entrepreneurship. We highlight innovations in entrepreneurial education from seven European countries: Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Poland, and Sweden. Consulting these approaches, the following seams to be particularly crucial: action-/project-based learning, individual and collaborative (team) experiential learning, interdisciplinary grouping, enhancing entrepreneurial skills and knowledge, key qualifications (creativity, autonomy, responsibility, risk-taking), conceptual and informal learning, critical thinking, reflection, meta-cognition, working with innovative ideas, demythologization, learning through "fun", and student-company-university collaboration/networks.

T1  - Older people's perceptions towards conventional and functional yoghurts through the repertory grid method: A cross-country study
AN  - 225133786
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate older people's perceptions, across eight European countries (the UK, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Italy), towards functional foods. The repertory grid method was used to elicit reasons underlying preferences of five yoghurts with different functional properties and two conventional ones. Familiarity was the key driver in products' separation. For the Italian case, as well as the Spanish, Portuguese, Danish and Swedish the first principal axis could be interpreted as novel-common axis, whilst it was not in the UK, Germany and Poland. Behavioural intention to buy functional yoghurts was more strongly predicted and moderated by single item perceived need (PN) than single item affective and/or cognitive attitude (AA, CA), even though PN, AA and CA could be consistently assessed within the same latent measure (in all countries but Denmark). Nevertheless, beliefs/attitudes towards a novel category of products such as functional foods may be reasonably keeping moving. In this study, preference instructions pertaining to beneficial and imagery attributes, revealed idiosyncratic properties associated with functional yoghurts across eight European samples of older people.

AB  - The research highlighted that those executives who are seen as successful leaders are also seen as open-minded, courageous, have personal impact, empower others, build strong teams and are adaptable. An internal validation of the question "you want to go the extra mile for them" showed that the most significant factors were: 'trusted', 'presence', 'empowers', 'drive and energy' and 'personable' above the factor of 'completer finisher'.

T1  - The search for mastery: An investigation into creativity as an antecedent to early counselor case conceptualization development
AN  - 304606266
AB  - The search for expertise in counseling practice had led to a broad study of counselor development. Calls for the improvement of counselor training programs by improving understanding of counselor cognitive complexity, along with advances in the psychometric measurement of creativity, provided a new direction in understanding how mental health counselors can be more effectively trained and thus develop greater expertise. Using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, this study investigated the unique contribution creativity provided to the case conceptualization skills of counselor trainees. Creative attitudes open to divergent thinking demonstrated statistically significant predictive power whereas variations in early clinical experience did not. These findings provide a building block for future research in the utility of creativity instruments as a measure of predicting counselor development and expertise. Study limitations, as well as issues in the selection, training, and future research of counselor trainees are discussed.

AN  - 215840243
AB  - The growing attention being paid to stakeholders' needs and desires reflects the growing importance of requirements engineering  (RE) in software and systems development. This introduction reviews the RE process: identifying the stakeholders in a project,  determining who and how important they are, prioritizing the identified stakeholder roles, and selecting representative individuals or  groups from the identified and prioritized stakeholder roles with whom the development team can elicit and validate system requirements.  The authors then mention each article in the issue in the context of today's latest thinking on RE.  This article introduces a special  issue on stakeholders in requirements engineering.

T1  - Multiple Museum Construct Motivators: a Multivariable Analysis with Repertory Grid Analysis (RGA) Approach
AN  - 1699001707
AB  - This paper aims to present and highlight the importance of factors resulting from Repertory Grid Analysis (R.G.A.). Strategic planning management issues concerning the management of museum audience are studied. A short description of the R.G.A. and the corresponding literature is cited, and an empirical application of the aforementioned method in a sample of 128 university students, takes place. The application of RGA produced 1345 interpretation models (constructs) which were coded and analyzed with three multivariable statistical techniques. The paper clearly demonstrates the importance of the analysis of constructs in relation to the management (local authorities or private institutions) suggestions that concern the museums of a specific area. Also, it contributes to the evolution of a new research area for the Destination Marketing Management with emphasis on Place design practices and development. Cultural offers and special managerial suggestions about particular groups of museums (strategic museum groups), are also discussed.

T1  - Making a difference: On the constraints of consensus building and the relevance of deliberation in stakeholder dialogues
AN  - 221249278
AB  - This article illuminates the contribution of stakeholder dialogues to environmental policy making. It makes a distinction between stakeholder dialogues as consensus building  and stakeholder dialogues as deliberation. Although consensus building seems to be the dominant approach in participatory environmental policy making, this article questions the merits of consensus building and it uses the experience of the Dutch stakeholder dialogue project Climate OptiOns for the Long term (COOL) to explore, in a deliberative design, the shortcomings of a consensus-building approach and how they are possibly dealt with. The article presents the results of two deliberative methods that have been used in the COOL project - the repertory grid analysis and the dialectical approach - to demonstrate how a deliberative design can help policy makers to critically assess arguments in favor of and against a broad range of policy options, and deal with stakeholder conflict in an early phase of the policy process.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Network pictures: concepts and representations
AN  - 237043647
AB  - There has recently been an increase in interest in the notion of "network pictures" amongst researchers in the field of business-to-business marketing. Network pictures are managers' subjective mental representations of their relevant business environment. They are posited to work as "sense-making" devices, and consequently shape managerial decisions, actions, and evaluations. However, while interest in this concept has been reported in a range of literature that is here identified and discussed, there has been no attempt to rigorously conceptualize the underlying dimensions of such pictures. This paper aims to address this issue. Based on an extensive review of previous work, this study proposes a parsimonious set of interrelated dimensions, and initially tests this approach. This article shows the model's face validity, but also argues that not all dimensions are perceived as being equally useful: utilization of the different dimensions is determined more by what it is that managers wish to represent.

T1  - A Technological Frames Perspective on Information Technology and Organizational Change
AN  - 236297990
AB  - When information technologies (IT) have a central role in organizational change programs, understanding how organization members make sense of technology is critical to influencing their actions and to achieving planned outcomes. Orlikowski and Gash articulated a theoretic framework centered on technological frames of reference (TFR) to investigate interpretive processes related to IT in organizations. The TFR framework has been cited across a wide range of publications and has formed the basis for a genre of studies on the interpretive aspects of IT and organizational change. In this article, the author assesses these research contributions and argues that further theoretic development is needed for the TFR framework to reach its potential contributions to knowledge. The author outlines the following research strategies that could facilitate TFR theory development: focusing analysis on frame structure, investigating framing as a dynamic interpretive process, and examining the cultural and institutional basis of organizational frames.

T1  - More (good) leaders for the public sector
AN  - 234489031
AB  - This paper aims to describe the development of a wholly new model of transformational leadership and its applications in practice. The paper provides a description of a wholly new, inclusive model of transformational leadership and the way in which it can be applied in practice, in the context of embedding good leadership within the culture of an organisation and ensuring "best practice" in 360-degree feedback. The paper finds that the Transformational Leadership Questionnaire (TLQ), which is both gender- and ethnicity-inclusive measure of "nearby" leadership, differs fundamentally from the kind of "heroic" models that have emanated from the USA and which have dominated the literature. Comparative data are presented of the mean scores on the TLQ, based on direct reports' ratings of their line manager, across a wide range of public sector organisations, including local government, the NHS, schools, and two central government agencies. Patterns emerge in areas of strength and developmental need, and the implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the impact of leadership behaviour and its effect on the psychological safety and well-being at work of staff.

T1  - Editorial Preface: In Support of Qualitative Information Systems Research
AN  - 195151709
AB  - There is a growing community of researchers conducting global qualitative investigations in information systems. In situations where relatively little is known about an area under investigation, such as global research, qualitative approaches allow the researcher to conduct investigations to identify emerging themes. Various theories exist attempting to address cultural variability of global research. The selected qualitative approaches for consideration by researchers are behavioral approaches and cognitive approaches. There are many more approaches that may be employed when conducting research. It is very important that the researcher thoroughly understand an approach to be adopted and why it is the most appropriate for the investigation about to be carried out. Finally, it is suggested that researchers not blindly adopt a research approach. The research approach should be based upon the research question and the objectives for conducting the research. Consideration of the approaches should be made in this light.

T1  - Eliciting Managers' Personal Values: An Adaptation of the Laddering Interview Method
AN  - 195078095
AB  - The authors describe an adaptation of the laddering method that allows interpretive researchers to uncover informants' personal values during the course of a single interview where other subjects are also explored. The authors explain laddering and illustrate its outcomes by means of case examples. The method allows the exploration of personal values to be integrated into a more flexible interview method, providing greater scope for probing salient issues while optimizing the (potentially limited) time available with informants.

T1  - Consumer perceptions of novel fruit and familiar fruit: A repertory grid application
AN  - 222672711
AB  - To explore how consumers perceive novel and familiar fruit, repertory grid interviews were carried out with 60 New Zealand women. Participants described their perceptions of nine fruit varying in familiarity. The data analysis established a two-dimensional stimuli space that separated samples with respect to familiarity and the amount of preparation required. Fruit that was familiar was characterised as being well liked, easily available in shops and by a number of different use situations. The primary association with novel fruit was that it was expensive. The participants could not readily think of use situations for fruit they were unfamiliar with. Consumers were separated into groups according to the trait of food neophobia, which pertains to an individual's stable propensity to approach or avoid novel foods. When comparing the most neophobic (n = 14; avoids novel foods) and most neophilic (n = 14; approaches novel foods), individuals perceptual differences were uncovered pertaining to which of the fruit were considered novel and to the suitability of some usage situations (cooking and for children). This finding contributed to the growing evidence of the relationship between food neophobia and consumers' everyday food-related behaviour. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Relevant attributes in assessment for design features of indoor games halls: The application of importance -performance analysis
AN  - 304987597
AB  - The problem of this study was to develop and validate a salient set of related attributes in assessment for design features of Indoor Games Hall (IGH). A total of 39 subjects and 26 subjects, respectively, were invited to interview sessions for the expert judges method and modal salient beliefs method generating attributes. A total of 60 IGH design features attributes were generated from these two methods. Twenty-nine IGH design features attributes passed the minimum frequency requirements of the 15% rule. The validation panel, comprised of four experts, approved these 29 attributes and, at the same time, waived the 15% rule to include eight more attributes into the complete list of salient IGH design features which consisted of 37 attributes. A close-ended questionnaire, consisting of three parts with (1) demographic survey, (2) the relative importance of the 37 IGH design features, and (3) opinion on the performance of the 37 IGH design features, was constructed for a pilot study with 299 respondents and subsequently the main study with 675 patrons. The statistical results of this study indicated that this instrument, comprised of eight factors which made up of 37 attributes, is valid (with eigenvalues ranging from 1.06 to 9.22 and accounting for 56.6% total variance) and reliable (coefficient reliability ranged from .61 to .89). This eight-factor model of the IGH design features was made up of 37 attributes including: (1) exercise related physical environment, (2) orientation and ancillary facilities, (3) facility environment, (4) changing and shower facilities, (5) architectural design, (6) parking and spectator facilities, (7) ceilings and walls, and (8) accessibility. In conclusion, this study constitutes a valid process for attribute development within the context of the conditions set forth in this study.

T1  - Structure of multi-criteria decision-making
AN  - 231332307
AB  - Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is presented as an eight-stage process of shaping information that satisfies the following criteria. The information should be accessible, differentiable, abstractable, understandable, verifiable, measurable, refinable and usable. For some stages, the decision-advisor should emphasize doing the stage convincingly by carrying out first its technical aspects, then relating to the context of the problem, and finally by taking into account the particular situation of the decision. For others, the decision-advisor should emphasize evincing information from the decision-maker first by relating to the situation of the decision, then seeing it in its context, and finally in its technical aspects. Methods for supporting the first four stages are shown to be personal construct theory for accessing the information, grounded theory for differentiating clusters of constructs, critical realism for abstracting their real meaning, and Nomology to understand how they fit into the criteria tree. An illustration is given. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Psychological similarity in work-based relationships and the development of self-efficacy beliefs
AN  - 231485185
AB  - The subject of work-based relationships as a source of support, feedback and development has centrality in much of the research into management development. Specifically, work dealing with manager/subordinate and peer relationships, as well as more formally defined developmental relationships such as that of the mentor, coach or counsellor, are of interest to the management researcher. This article examines the concept of psychological similarity through shared meanings, in relation to the maintenance and development of self-efficacy beliefs. This examination is carried out through comparative case studies in two very different organizational settings; the corporate and the not-for-profit sector. It was found that in the work-based relationships in which the parties are psychologically similar, such relationships are more likely to support the maintenance and development of self-efficacy beliefs.

T1  - Questions are good for you
AN  - 202942447
AB  - [Reg Revans] was right about ignorance, too. Have you noticed that questions starting with something like 'This may be a silly question, but ...' are invariably the most profound, searching questions you are ever asked? I find it takes courage to ask a naive question (the fear of looking stupid has been a deep and enduring lesson from my school days), but these questions are often the best.

T1  - Knowledge acquisition for dynamic personalization in e-commerce
AN  - 305295967
AB  - Information technology is playing an increasingly important role in today's world. Commerce through Internet is not an exception to this phenomenon. Currently the focus in the retailer e-commerce is shifting toward catering to the needs of repeat customers by offering them more personalized services. One of the barriers to such an individualized approach to each customer is the difficulty of collecting information about individual users. This thesis addresses this  knowledge acquisition problem.   Based on a thorough analysis of different kinds of knowledge acquisition tools and techniques, we propose an architecture that allows the use of a combination of different approaches for knowledge acquisition about users in e-commerce. This architecture is designed to support dynamic adaptation of the user profile to changes in the user interests as well as in the store. The architecture is based on two core concepts, namely dynamic personalization and software agent-support. To reduce the time and effort put in the process of knowledge acquisition by the user and by the knowledge engineer software agents in the proposed architecture assist in different aspects of the process, such as profile initialization, processing of results discovered by the web mining, making changes to user profile and tracking their effects, and in trust related issues and interaction with other agents and systems. A proof of concept prototype has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture.

T1  - Significance-testing the validity of idiographic methods: A little derangement goes a long way
AN  - 216451551
AB  - We present an experimental design for validating idiographic data and the mathematical basis for subjecting this to statistical hypothesis testing. The method involves matching descriptions of four or more objects to the people from which they arose. If four or more can be matched, this is unlikely (p < 0.05) to have arisen by chance alone and the null hypothesis that the data communicate no information can be rejected. This criterion score of 4 is sufficient for statistical significance regardless of the total number of objects on which matching was attempted. The mathematics of this somewhat counterintuitive result is given, and we argue that this method is of value in validating idiographic data. Its relationship with the `method of mismatched cases' is discussed.

T1  - Expressions of caring by contemporary surgical nurses: A phenomenological study
AN  - 305462865
AB  - Care and caring forms the basic core of nursing actions. It has been stated that caring is nursing and nursing is caring (Leininger, 1988). The two are inseparable when theories attempt to describe what nursing is. Yet, many nurses today find it difficult to define caring behaviors. Nurses are frustrated in the workplace, as a variety of internal and external forces have rapidly changed the delivery of nursing care in the past 10 years. Nurses attempt to uphold standards of nursing practice in an environment that often defeats the essence of nursing-caring. The lived experience of nurses who work in acute care surgical units was explored in this study in an attempt to better describe the phenomenon of caring in the context of contemporary practice.    Ten nurses participated in this research study. A semi-structured interview guided the conversation between the researcher and the participant. Participants were encouraged to share their expressions of caring in the context of the new practice environment. The data that was gathered provided a rich description of the meaning of caring and the positive and negative expressions that impacted on the nurses ability to care. The data were analyzed using van Manen's (1997) phenomenological guide to human research.    Meaningful expressions by the participants were extracted from the data to formulate four major themes, supported by the essential structures. Research findings were congruent with the nursing literature and the five perspectives of the sensitizing framework by Morse, Solberg, Neander, Bottorff, and Johnson (1990). Recommendations for nursing practice and administration, education, and research are made based upon the study results.

T1  - Dalzell's theorem and the analysis of proportions: A methodological note
AN  - 199583624; 10832520
AB  - The golden section is a well-known proportion that occurs when something (e.g., a line) is divided into two unequal parts such that the smaller (m) is to the larger (M) as the larger is to the sum of the two (i.e. m/M = M/(M+m) = .618). Dalzell's theorem holds that the absolute value of the difference between M/(M+m) and .618 will tend to be smaller than the corresponding difference between m/M and .618.

T1  - Understanding and measuring tourist destination images
AN  - 214525050
AB  - A destination image is 'the expression of all objective knowledge, impressions, prejudice, imaginations, and emotional thoughts an individual or group might have of a particular place' (Lawson and Baud Bovy, 1977). Destination images influence a tourist's travel decision-making, cognition and behaviour at a destination as well as satisfaction levels and recollection of the experience. This paper looks at the concept of tourist destination images and how destination image research has been approached from different academic disciplines and by practitioners such as tourism marketers. In particular, different techniques for the measurement of a tourist's destination images are reviewed and the dominance of structured, word-based approaches is highlighted. This paper adds to previous work that has listed the main attributes used in image studies by including recent studies, many of which are Australian. In the paper it is argued that to provide valid image research, a preliminary phase of qualitative research is important in order to distil the constructs relevant to the population being studied. Construct elicitation techniques, such as free-elicitation, interactive interviews and focus group interviews, are discussed along with new techniques that include the visual aspect of image, such as photo-elicitation.

AB  - How effectively people are used within organisations has become a major issue for employers, and the human resource management movement has developed as employers seek appropriate structures to foster individual potential at work ( Schein, 1980 ). Human resource management has been defined as: '...a strategic approach to the acquisition, motivation, development and management of the organisation's human resources' ( Cuming, 1993 ). It aims to enable employees to develop the attitudes, knowledge and skills needed to manage their work roles ( Kamoche, 1994 ). The organisation gains greater employee commitment and motivation resulting in the achievement of the business strategy ( Storey, 1989 ).

T1  - Seeing the voice of the customer: Metaphor-based advertising research
AN  - 205138203; 01092377; 02869233
AB  - Although improvements in traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques have enhanced their to collect timely, valid and reliable data, and to analyze these data with greater insights, advertising practitioners continue to search for and experiment with alternative methodologies.  Seven basic premises for improving advertising research and company development are presented, and the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) is introduced.  ZMET is designed to surface the mental models that drive consumer thinking and behavior, and characterize these models in actionable ways using consumers' metaphors.  These mental models reveal basic reasoning processes and provide useful insights about consumers and their latent and emerging needs.  Such insights can provide developers of advertising copy and creative staff guidance for capturing consumer attention and engaging consumer thought processes.  It is suggested that ZMET is a promising means for improving advertising research.

AB  - Everyone involved in transportation and land-use planning will at some stage be involved with data collection. Even if not directly concerned with the design and conduct of surveys, they will certainly wish to use data at some time, and at that stage they will realise what should have been done in the design and administration phases of the survey. Each individual's introductions to survey data may have widely differing emotional connotations. For some, it may be an horrific experience as they try to grapple with data which have been collected by someone else, only to find that the documentation associated...

T1  - Meaning of the Concept "Suicide" and Risk for Attempted Suicide
AN  - 848880377
AB  - Previous research (Parker, 1981; Wetzel, 1976a) has shown that within psychiatric populations, individuals at high and low levels of suicide risk assign different meanings to the concept "suicide." In the current study, this issue was investigated in a nonclinical population by having a large sample of college undergraduates rate the word "suicide" on scales reflecting the evaluative (good versus bad) and potency (strong versus weak) dimensions of suicide. Utilizing five separate self-report measures of risk for attempted suicide it was found, as predicted, that while "suicide" is in general perceived very negatively, individuals classified as higher risk for attempted suicide rate suicide as less "bad" and less "weak" than did their lower risk peers. Several future directions for research investigating the association between the meaning that an individual assigns to the suicidal act and risk for attempting or completing suicide are suggested.

T1  - Construct System Organization and Schizophrenia: The Role of Construct Integration
AN  - 848853860
AB  - Personal construct psychology researchers frequently have linked a low degree of construct relatedness to schizophrenia. However, researchers also have found a low degree of construct relatedness to be predictive of accuracy in person perception tasks. Attempting to clarify this, Landfield (1977,1980) proposed that the schizophrenic's construing is characterized by both a low degree of construct integration and a low degree of construct relatedness. The role of both these variables was explored by administering repertory grids to 20 schizophrenic and 20 nonschizophrenic adult psychiatric inpatients. The linkage of schizophrenia to both a low degree of construct relatedness and a low degree of construct integration was supported. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Repertory Grid Methodology and the Analysis of Group Perceptions in Retailing
AN  - 198035495; 00433968
AB  - The use and potential of Repertory Grid Methodology and Personal Construct Theory (Kelly, 1955) in attitude measurement in retailing is investigated.  Researchers have been attracted to the Kelly theory because of its objectivity and the chance of obtaining a group viewpoint.  Case studies using the methodology include: 1.  students' shopping patterns (Hudson, 1974), 2.  shopping centers (Timmermans, Van Der Heijden, and Westerveld, 1982), 3.  comparison shopping -- shoes (Coshall, 1984, 1985), 4.  food shopping -- all store types (Opacic and Potter, 1985, 1986), and 5.  food superstores (Hallsworth, 1987).  The applicability of Kelly's technique was expanded by breaking away from a dependence on the assessment of the opinions of less than 100 persons.  The overriding advantage of the technique is its objectivity; it does not permit researchers to impose ideas on the subjects.  Constructs derived from retail applications of Kelly-type analysis are usually meaningful and easily understood by third parties, but the method can be very time-consuming.  This is reflected often in its sample sizes.

T1  - An Analysis of Three Managerial Jobs Using Repertory Grids
AN  - 194217234; 00124307
AB  - Accurate job analysis is the basis of industrial psychology, and it should provide the framework for decisions about: 1.  selection, 2.  training, 3.  job evaluation, and 4.  organization.  A repertory grid approach to job analysis is a technique that can be applied to the jobs of individual managers.  This technique enables a psychologist to produce a representation of an individual's ''mental model'' pictured as a mental map or dendrogram.  The subjects were 3 managers employed by a large chain of bakers in the north-west of England.  The repertory grid approach was used to define the 3 management jobs.  The results showed that the repertory grid analysis allowed for a more systematic and quantitative analysis, as it identifies: 1.  the most demanding tasks, 2.  the most important qualities, and 3.  the number and nature of any underlying trends.  The repertory grid analysis has the advantage of producing a pictorial representation of a job by plotting the position of each part of a job by using the loadings on the first 2 components as if they were references on a map.
