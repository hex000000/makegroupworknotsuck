TT  - Rigidez cognitiva en pacientes con depresión y fibromialgia
AN  - 2293792796
AB  - Background/Objective: The comorbidity of depression and fibromyalgia chronic syndrome has been well documented in the literature; however, the cognitive structure of these patients has not been assessed. Previous results reported variability in cognitive rigidity in depressive patients, the key for this might be the presence of chronic physical pain such as fibromyalgia. The present study explores and compares the cognitive rigidity and differentiation, between patients with depression with and without fibromyalgia syndrome. Method: Thirty one patients with depression and fibromyalgia were matched, considering age, sex and number of depressive episodes, with 31 patients with depression but without fibromyalgia diagnosis. Cognitive rigidity and differentiation were measured with the repertory grid technique. Results: The results indicated that depressed patients with fibromyalgia presented higher levels of depressive symptoms, greater cognitive rigidity and lower cognitive differentiation than those without fibromyalgia. Conclusions: The results might inform future treatments to address the cognitive structure of these patients.Alternate abstract:Antecedentes/Objetivo: La comorbilidad de la depresión y la fibromialgia ha sido bien documentada en la literatura. Sin embargo, la estructura cognitiva de estos pacientes no ha sido evaluada. Estudios previos muestran variabilidad en medidas de rigidez cognitiva en pacientes con depresión. Los síndromes físicos crónicos podrían ser una variable clave para explicar esta variabilidad presente en estudios previos. El presente estudio explora y compara la rigidez y la diferenciación cognitiva entre paciente con depresión que tienen y aquellos que no tienen fibromialgia. Método: Treinta y un pacientes con depresión y fibromialgia fueron emparejados, considerando edad, sexo y números de episodios depresivos con 31 pacientes con depresión, pero sin diagnóstico de fibromialgia. Resultados: Los resultados indican que los pacientes que presentan depresión y fibromialgia evidencian niveles más altos de síntomas depresivos, mayor rigidez cognitiva y menor diferenciación cognitiva que los pacientes sin fibromialgia. Conclusiones: Estos resultados podrían ser considerados al momento de crear tratamientos ajustados a la estructura cognitiva de estos pacientes.

T1  - A personal construct approach to employability: comparing stakeholders’ implicit theories
AN  - 2224998756
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to adopt the perspective of personal construct theory to conceptualise employability. The study explores differences in the implicit employability theories of those involved in developing employability (educators) and those selecting and recruiting higher education (HE) students and graduates (employers).Design/methodology/approachA repertory grid technique (RGT) was employed to uncover the implicit theories of 22 employers and 14 educators across the UK.FindingsA total of 717 constructs were elicited. A differential analysis of data gathered demonstrated several areas of consensus among employers and educators (including emotional management, confidence, professionalism), as well as divergence in representations of commitment, proactivity, interpersonal competencies and vision to the conceptualisation of employability.Practical implicationsFindings from this analysis indicate a need to integrate group process assessments within undergraduate programmes and recruitment procedures.Originality/valueThis study represents a personal construct approach to employability, utilising the unique value of RGT to further inform our understanding of employability within an HE context. This study contributes to an understanding of employability as a continually re-constructed concept. This study provides insights to its nature via two information rich cases that have extensive knowledge on the topic.

T1  - Cognitive Structures of Teachers in Relation to ‘Ideal School’
AN  - 2184015872
AB  - There are various factors influencing teachers' perceptions of the ideal school concept, but the school they work has a foremost impact shaping cognitive structures of the ideal school quality. However, the research on school and qualities of schools are limited with metaphor analysis. This research addresses this gap by elucidating the similarities and differences between the cognitive structures of teachers working at primary schools regarding the qualities of the ideal school, using the repertory grid technique. The participants of this research are twenty teachers who are working for three years in the same school. The study employs a mixed research design. Decision making grid technique was used as a data collection tool and content analysis and exploratory factor analysis were used in data analysis. Findings show that the structures formed by teachers are composed of two dimensions: individual and institution. The factor that comes to the fore in the individual dimension is the ideal school, and the factor that stands out in the institution dimension is the non-ideal school. The structures that represent the ideal school factor are the managers, teachers, students, parents, satisfaction, trust and hierarchal relations in the individual dimension. Teachers' cognitive fictions are more prominent in the institution dimension of non-ideal schools. In non-ideal schools, teachers' cognitive fictions showed that factors such as socio-economic environment, physical condition of the school, equipment and in-service training opportunities are influential.

T1  - Creating Knowledge in the Design Thinking Process: Reflections on Participatory Design
AN  - 2158168538
AB  - Given the state of inter-connectedness of the world today, and the associated pervasiveness of the internet, there are a growing number of ICT applications becoming available to end-users across all walks of life which are being used on a multitude of devices. However during this boom of application development, too few designers incorporate the user in the design process. Given the foregoing, this paper reports on an aspect of participatory empathetic user design. We argue that from a participatory design point of view, users who possess tacit knowledge and who may possess explicit knowledge as well, may be brought into the design space to work with the designer who already has a wealth of both knowledge types. Both tacit and explicit knowledge types have been debated in the extant literature. Fundamentally, Cook and Brown (1999: 385) believe that "tacit knowledge cannot be turned into explicit knowledge, nor can explicit knowledge be turned into tacit". We argue that the two forms of knowledge may be reciprocal during the process of participatory design. The paper thus lends support to Wynn and Williams (2012) who argue that the generation of new knowledge is the result of "... our interaction with the world," because the world and entities that constitute reality exist 'out there' independent of our human knowledge. We argue that knowledge is not only a belief of knowing and thinking but rather an ability to transform it into real action. The paper posits that tacit and explicit forms of knowledge are inextricably linked and that "knowledge is created and expanded through social interaction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge" using modes of 'knowledge conversion'. This paper presents a model for application empathetic design that describes how knowledge creation unfolds among co-design team thereby enriching the design outcome of the application. Design iterations result into dialogic interaction and participatory learning process which may be formal or informal. This in turn helps to re-align the expectations and experiences of both the designers and the would be users.

T1  - Reconstruction of a Caregiver Burden Scale: Identifying Culturally Sensitive Items in Saudi Arabia
AN  - 2027475876
AB  - For this study, we adapted the Montgomery Borgatta Caregiver Burden Scale, used widely in the United States, to the Saudi Arabian context. To produce an Arabic, culturally sensitive version of the scale, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 Saudi family caregivers. The Arabic version of the scale was tested, and participants were asked to comment on the appropriateness of items for the construct of "caregiver burden" using the repertory grid technique and laddering procedure - two constructivist methods derived from personal construct theory. From interview findings, we examined the content of the items and the caregiver burden construct itself. Our findings suggest that the use of constructivist methods to refine constructs and quantitative instruments is highly informative. This strategy is feasible even when little is known about the investigated constructs in the target culture and further elucidates our understanding of cross-cultural variations or invariance of different versions of the scale.

TT  - Fast Food Consumption Decisions of High School and Equivalent School Students
AN  - 2032718512
AB  - In today's societies, ready-consumed foods or foods that are prepared in short time is gaining importance due to the factors including; increase in family income, transportation problem in metropolitan cities, increase in number of fast food restaurants and their delivery services, and increase women’s part in business life and spending more time at work. Objective of this study was to determine the fast food consumption decisions of high school and equivalent school students and the factors effecting in making their decisions. Thus, 126 students attending high school or equivalent schools in Erzurum in 2012 were surveyed, and the data were obtained through the Repertory Grid Technique. Four criteria were presented to students including foods price, taste, healthiness and being prepared in short time. It was concluded that, among all criteria presented, students give importance the deliciousness of foods the most, and then healthiness, preparation time, and price of them, respectively.Alternate abstract:Kadınların iş hayatına girmesi ve zamanının büyük bir bölümünü işte geçirmesi, aile gelirinin artması, büyük şehirlerdeki ulaşım problemi, fast food restoranların sayısındaki hızlı artış ve bu restoranların evlere servis yapması gibi faktörler nedeniyle kısa sürede hazırlanan ya da hazır tüketilen yiyecekler günümüz toplumlarında önem kazanmaktadır. Bu çalışmada lise ve dengi okullarda eğitim gören öğrencilerin fast food tüketim kararları ve bu kararlarını belirlemede etkili olan faktörlerin ortaya konulması amaçlanmıştır. Bu amaçla 2012 yılında Erzurum ilinde lise ve dengi okullarda öğrenim gören 126 öğrenci ile anket yapılmış ve elde edilen veriler Repertuar çizelgesi tekniği ile analiz edilmiştir. Öğrencilere gıdaların fiyatı, lezzeti, sağlıklı olması ve kısa sürede hazırlanması olmak üzere 4 kriter sunulmuştur. Öğrencilerin bu kriterler arasından tükettikleri gıdaların lezzetli olmasına en fazla önemi verdikleri, daha sonra sırasıyla tükettikleri gıdaların sağlıklı olması, hazırlama süresi ve fiyatına önem verdikleri belirlenmiştir.

T1  - Mothers’ Perceptions of Toddler Beverages
AN  - 2026382873
AB  - Background: The prevalence of obesity among Australian pre-school children is a major concern with links to poor health outcomes. One contributing factor is excess energy intake. Sugar-sweetened beverages are energy-dense, nutrient-poor, readily available and have been implicated in the increasing prevalence of obesity. Furthermore, preschooler beverage consumption may develop into dietary habits that track into adulthood. There is little research on factors influencing parents’ decision-making when serving beverages to their preschoolers, or on mothers’ perceptions of preschooler’s beverages. The aim of this study was to explore mothers’ perceptions of commonly consumed preschooler beverages. Methods: The Repertory Grid Technique and the Laddering Technique methodologies were utilized in interviews with 28 mothers from Melbourne, Australia, to explore beverage perceptions. Results: A large number of diverse perceptual categories (‘constructs’) (n = 22) about beverages were elicited, demonstrating the complexity of mothers’ perceptions when making beverage choices for their preschoolers. The five most common categories were related to health, sugar, dairy, packaging, and additives. Thematic analysis of responses from the laddering method identified three major themes: concerns about the types of beverages mothers would like to provide their preschoolers, the healthiness of a beverage, and the sugar content. Conclusions: Mothers’ perceptions of beverages are sophisticated and need to be included in the design of health communication strategies by health promoters and government agencies to influence mothers’ beverage selections for their preschoolers.

T1  - Emotional eating and cognitive conflicts as predictors of binge eating disorder in patients with obesity
TT  - Alimentación emocional y conflictos cognitivos como predictores del trastorno por atracón en pacientes con obesidad
AN  - 1987346623
AB  - Background/Objectives: Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is often associated with obesity. In order to identify the variables that allow to better detect the presence of BED, people with overnutrition were compared with and without BED in the presence of cognitive conflicts, eating symptoms and anxious-depressive symptoms. The inclusion of cognitive conflicts had been relevant in bulimia studies but had not been investigated with respect to BED. Method: Two groups with obesity were evaluated, one without BED (OB, n = 54) and the other with BED (OB-BED, n = 48), using a social-demographic questionnaire as well as a semi-structured interview to assess BED, questionnaires (DASS-21, EDE-Q, EEQ) and the Repertory Grid Technique. Results: Overall, the OB-BED group presented more conflicts and more symptoms. The model that best differentiated between the groups included emotional eating and level of cognitive conflicts, correctly classifying 91.4% of the sample. Conclusion: These results highlight the role played by cognitive conflicts and emotional eating as differentiating elements between OB and OB-BED, with a high level of predictive accuracy.Alternate abstract:Antecedentes/Objetivos: El trastorno por Atracón (TA) es un trastorno de la conducta alimentaria asociado frecuentemente con la obesidad. Con el objetivo de identificar las variables que permiten detectar mejor la presencia de TA se compararon personas con malnutrición por exceso con y sin TA respecto a la presencia de conflictos cognitivos, sintomatología alimentaria y sintomatología ansioso-depresiva. La inclusión de los conflictos cognitivos había resultado relevante en estudios con bulimia pero no habían sido investigados con respecto al TA. Método: Se evaluó a dos grupos con obesidad, uno sin TA (OB, n = 54) y otro con TA (OBTA, n = 48), utilizando un cuestionario sociodemográfico, una entrevista semiestructurada para evaluar TA, cuestionarios (DASS-21, EDE-Q, EEQ) y la Técnica de la Rejilla. Se realizaron análisis de comparación de grupos y de regresión logística. Resultados: El grupo OBTA presentó más conflictos y más sintomatología. El modelo que mejor diferenció entre los grupos incluyó la alimentación emocional y el nivel de conflictos cognitivos, clasificando correctamente al 91,4% de la muestra. Conclusiones: Estos resultados resaltan el rol que juegan los conflictos cognitivos y la alimentación emocional como aspectos diferenciadores entre OB y OBTA, con un alto nivel de precisión predictiva.

T1  - Transformed Sound as Personal Construct
AN  - 1967838683
AB  - To better understand the function of sound within electronic music it is inevitable to consider the way composers and performers talk about such sound and its different qualities. An attempt to classify sound is a logical consequence of the desire to orient oneself in a vast field of possibilities. It remains difficult, however, to relate such a classification to the intuitive way we talk about sound. Heavily influenced by our individual upbringing, cultural and musical environment and, perhaps most strongly, by our peers in the creation and performance of music, words verbalised in relation to sound and music invite a systematic investigation. This article exemplifies such an investigation, attempting the elicitation and structuring of a vocabulary from eight musically trained individuals in a two-stage experiment. The words examined here are concerned with sounds created by transformation of acoustic sources through electronic processing methods.

T1  - Identification and Classification of Effective Operational Plans on Sustainable Production Using Repertory Grid and Principal Component Analysis: A Case Study on Industrial Production Companies in Semnan Province, Iran
AN  - 2270076299
AB  - Attenuation of natural resources, climate changes, environmental pollution, ecological incompatibility of industrial activities with the environment, and decrease in quality of human's life due to the acceleration of global industrialization are critical factors intensively pushed production to resist against the problems while keep its competitiveness. In this regard, sustainability and, especially for production, moving towards sustainable production in order to respond to challenges that industrial countries may be encountered with in this route are of significant importance. Sustainability is an increasingly important necessity for human activities and making a sustainable development is a key goal of human development. Sustainable development is an approach targeting various social, economic and environmental issues, generally and simultaneously, in the development process. The concept of sustainable production, which is closely related to the concept of sustainable development, targets the production companies and service providers. The current paper is focused on sustainability of productive businesses and aims to identify the structures of sustainable production and to evaluate and classify more effective plans in this field. In this regard, the dimensions and structures of sustainable production were identified using interview and repertory grid method through the viewpoints of the managers of 33 successful industrial production companies with at least 5 years continuous and sustainable activity in Semnan province, Iran. Based on the interviews, 33 individual repertory grids and 175 primary individual structures of sustainable production were created. After analyzing these structures, the aggregated grid of sustainable production including 87 secondary structures was drawn. In the next step, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to divide the major structures which have more important roles for achieving sustainable production into two groups and to identify their components.

T1  - Optical Polling for Behavioural Threshold Analysis in Information Security
AN  - 2139460984
AB  - In terms of information security research, human attitude and behaviour are commonly sought to be assessed and addressed. These aspects remain complex and difficult to understand and control in order to efficiently manage them. Many psychological and sociological models exist to describe and test human behaviour but they are all reliant on data. This research presents a novel approach for data collection for the specific application of behavioural threshold analysis. Optical polling is found to be a viable alternative to traditional data collection methods which provides good quality data. It addresses some of the issues associated with behavioural threshold analysis and information security research in general.

T1  - Expert Teachers' Personal Constructs on Effective Parental Involvement for Adolescent Students
AN  - 2013353322
AB  - Parental roles and societal definitions of the concept of “parent” have changed over the history of U.S. public education. Concomitantly, there has been a marked debate among experts about the importance and effectiveness of parental involvement in education. In addressing this issue, research has concentrated on both the focus (what) and locus (where) of parental involvement but has seldom addressed the conjunction of focus and locus. This expert judgment study on parental involvement in adolescent education expands on the contemporary context of the parental role and offers a framework that demonstrates this multifaceted, contemporary view. This hypothesis-generating, two-phase study relied on Repertory Grid technique to develop a set of social construals shared by 22 individual case study participants, teacher experts who teach adolescent students (Grades 7 through 12) on Long Island. The second phase used an anonymous, online survey asking a larger sample of teacher experts (n = 238) to determine which social construct poles best describe ideal and typical parental behaviors in terms of effective parental involvement. Latent class analysis revealed heterogeneity in teachers’ experiences with typical parents but a shared, homogenous view of ideal parental behaviors. Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed systematic patterns in degree level and school type to predict class membership in the latent classes describing typical parental involvement behaviors. This detailed analysis of the expert judgments and conceptions of teachers about effective parental involvement in adolescent education concluded with implications for educational theory, research, policy, and future practice.

T1  - An Empirical Study of Crowdsourcing Services using Repertory Grid
AN  - 1951123755
AB  - A new form of distributed labor, namely, crowdsourcing is used to solve the real-world business challenges in different fields of services by using people crowds. Crowdsourcing gathers and generates concepts by adopting principles of distributed computing, open networks, and parallel processing. However, currently, there are limited formal methods or guidelines to analyze and develop crowdsourcing services. As a result, there is no clear understanding of different characteristics of various crowdsourcing services. The aim of this paper is to extract the critical factors as guidelines for successful crowdsourcing service development. In this paper, eight crowdsourcing services are analyzed using Repertory Grid, in order to identify the critical characteristics of the crowdsourcing services. In this study, 25 personal constructs are developed as key factors related to the successfulness of the crowdsourcing services. The services and constructs are analyzed with the aid of three correlation measures (e.g., Pearson, Spearman, and Kendal measures). We observe constructs with highly positive correlations and constructs with highly negative correlations with the 'successfulness' construct. As concluding remarks, we discuss the analysis results and future research directions.

T1  - Power, attraction, and reference in macrolevel social relations: An analysis of closed groups and closed societies based on the psychology of the "Soviet person"
AN  - 1916651344
AB  - In this article the features of social-relationship systems are analyzed based on the data from a sociopsychological empirical study conducted in two stages (2002 and 2014) on a large sample with the help of g. Kelly’s Repertory grid Technique. A. V. Petrovsky’s three-factor interpersonal-relationships model as interpreted for closed groups by M. Yu. Kondratev and the concept of the closed society as described by Karl Popper provide the foundation for the theoretical hypothesis we tested. The empirical data obtained in 2002 came from 391 participants of different ages who were living in provincial towns in the Nizhny Novgorod region. The elderly respondents (232 people) had lived almost all their lives under the Soviet regime; the middle-aged respondents (159 people) got their education and started their careers in the USSR. Soviet society is considered to be closed because of its authoritarian and collectivist nature, static social structure, and dogmatic ideology. It is argued that both closed societies and closed groups are characterized by a rigid hierarchical social structure, isolation from other systems, and depersonalization of social relations. We have proved that members of a closed group and citizens of a closed society have similar social-relationship matrices.

T1  - Taxonomy of payments: a repertory grid analysis
AN  - 1858613108
AB  - Purpose              Recent innovations in payment instruments have fundamentally changed the ways we pay. These innovations, such as mobile/SMS payments and online banking, contain features that are likely to influence how people choose to pay. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors that impact payers' choice of payment instruments.              Design/methodology/approach              Through in-depth interviews using the repertory grid technique, the authors explored 15 payers' perceptions of six payment instruments, including coins, banknotes, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and online banking. The approach draws heavily on organizational systematics to better understand payers' choice of payment instruments.              Findings              A four-category taxonomy of payments was developed. The authors refer to the taxonomy as the 4Ps: the purchase, the payer, the payment instrument, and the physical technology. The taxonomy comprises 16 payment characteristics consisting 76 payment features that influence payers' instrument choice. One characteristic not known in prior research was identified - that is, "cancellation" - a characteristic more frequently associated with digital payment instruments than with cash or checks.              Research limitations/implications              The findings suggest that payers view payment instruments in a much broader sense, including context, control, or cultural beliefs. Consequently, the authors suggest that researchers try to understand the essence of an innovation before assuming any economic rationalism in human or organizational behavior. The authors also urge researchers to understand the underlying meaning behind constructs of interest; as this study has shown that concepts like context and convenience have many different interpretations.              Practical implications              According to McKinsey (2014) there are over 12,000 startups in the payment arena. For them, the taxonomy can function as a template for the design of payment instruments, as well as understanding the various factors that influence payer choice of payment instruments.              Originality/value              The main contribution of this paper is the 4Ps taxonomy of payments. The taxonomy builds on and extends the work by Hirschman (1982). Since this work, and despite recent trends in payments, there has not been a comprehensive investigation that takes into account more recent innovations in payment instruments.

T1  - How do third-grade students and their teachers construe each other?
AN  - 1807740177
AB  - This study aims to identify teachers' personal constructs about students and students' personal constructs about teachers and to reveal to what extent they see each other as ideal. The study is descriptive and multiple-case in nature. In this regard, it was conducted with 6 third-grade students with different mean scores and 6 teachers who instructed them in a private school. Teachers' and students' views towards each other were identified through a repertory grid technique, which is a semi-structured interviewing method. Teachers' and students' constructs towards each other are reciprocal. Students who were represented with successful and positive personal constructs, and thus who were placed closely to the ideal student profile, tended to see their teachers as ideal teachers. Similarly, students who were represented with unsuccessful and negative personal constructs by their teachers, and thus were placed as distant from the ideal student profile, tended to evaluate the teachers who had those representations negatively. Findings of the study were discussed in terms of the expectancy effect model and the transactional model.

T1  - Towards a more effective detective
AN  - 1750421186
AB  - The characteristics that detectives believe are required to be an 'effective detective' were explored in this study. A Repertory Grid Technique and Critical Incident Technique were used to explore in detail the views of experienced detectives (N = 30) from five different police services in Australia and New Zealand about what makes an effective detective. The findings suggest that detectives hold a complex and challenging role that requires 11 key skills. By far, the most important factor was communication skills, particularly how to communicate effectively with a variety of people varying from victims and suspects to colleagues and scientific experts. High levels of motivation and thoroughness closely followed communication as essential skills. The implications of these findings for the recruitment, training and management of detectives are discussed. [web URL: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10439463.2014.912647]

T1  - Effort of EAI Projects: A Repertory Grid Investigation of Influencing Factors
AN  - 1714533237
AB  - Many companies struggle with effective and efficient accomplishment of enterprise application integration (EAI), resulting in significant time and budget overruns. Concerning project management, a major reason for failure is considered to be effort underestimation. This underestimation is an aftermath of applying estimation methods that do not account for all relevant factors influencing EAI project effort. Applying the Repertory Grid Technique, we explore factors affecting the effort of such projects by conducting 22 semi-structured expert interviews. We provide an extensive overview of 91 effort-influencing factors and their classification in nine categories, which can be used as a checklist in EAI projects.

T1  - Cognitive Constructions of Low-Profit and High-Profit Business Models: A Repertory Grid Study of Serial Entrepreneurs: ET&P ET&P
AN  - 1709469457
AB  - This study shows how the repertory grid methodology can be used to understand entrepreneurs' cognitive construction of business models and evidence of entrepreneurs' differential cognition of high-profit and low-profit business models. We show that entrepreneurs are more cognitively complex and more nuanced in constructing high-profit business models than low-profit business models. Furthermore, although they are perceived as meaningful, low-profit business models are characterized by relatively less clear cognitive constructions. This study suggests that the repertory grid technique may be useful for future research and entrepreneurship practice to understand the entrepreneurial cognition of business models.

T1  - CSR and Related Terms in SME Owner-Managers' Mental Models in Six European Countries: National Context Matters: JBE JBE
AN  - 1672825763
AB  - As a contribution to the emerging field of corporate social responsibility (CSR) cognition, this article reports on the findings of an exploratory study that compares SME owner-managers' mental models with regard to CSR and related concepts across six European countries (Belgium, Italy, Norway, France, UK, Spain). Utilising Repertory Grid Technique, we found that the SME owner-managers' mental models show a few commonalities as well as a number of differences across the different country samples. We interpret those differences by linking individual cognition to macro-environmental variables, such as language, national traditions and dissemination mechanisms. The results of our exploratory study show that nationality matters but that classifications of countries as found in the comparative capitalism literature do not exactly mirror national differences in CSR cognition and that these classifications need further differentiation. The findings from our study raise questions on the universality of cognition of academic management concepts and warn that promotion of responsible business practice should not rely on the use of unmediated US American management terminology.

T1  - Construal Of Voluntary Environmental Program Participation In The Canadian Residential Construction Industry
AN  - 1821855891
AB  - This is a study of sensemaking of how Canadian new home builders construe their decision to participate in a voluntary environmental program (Built Green Canada). The Repertory Grid Technique was the data collection method. Findings from 32 interviews revealed a number of themes that decision makers used to make sense of their decision to participate in the program. The most prevalent views related to seeing the decision as a function of being a leader or innovator in the industry and using the program as a marketing and sales tool. Furthermore, themes that were seen as important related to legitimacy/authenticity/integrity and environmental impact. An assessment of which drivers/pressures were important to decision makers in making the decision to join the program was also undertaken. Important drivers/pressures included handling competition, appealing to customers, acquiring technical knowledge, obtaining publicity, building corporate culture/identity, and obtaining third party certifications. The findings are significant as it assists in refining the emergent field of environmental decision making and planning. The results are also useful for industry, voluntary environmental program organizations, and government policy makers to provide them with a better understan

T1  - Genre fiction readers: a quantitative exploration of provided construct ratings
AN  - 2121471576
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to adapt a repertory grid technique to investigate fiction readers’ attitudes and beliefs, with a specific focus on minority ethnic fiction. Design/methodology/approach – The study required participants (n=36) to rate on a seven-point Likert scale a series of 16 provided constructs, using ten main elements, namely, the reader of ten fiction genres. Statistical tests investigated participant agreement across construct ratings, where on average fiction readers are rated on a construct continuum, and the extent to which public library work experience affected participants’ perceptions. Findings – Findings were revealed regarding the perceived characteristics of the readers of ten fiction genres, including minority ethnic fiction. The readers of Asian and Black British fiction were similarly rated, but certain exceptions were also noted which had not been reported in previous research. Although intraclass correlations indicated that ratings were consistent for the more established fiction genres, there was little agreement regarding minority fiction. Research limitations/implications – The research was potentially limited by the ethnic homogeneity of the sample population and the gender imbalance of same, and (in some cases) a lack of knowledge of minority fiction genres. It was felt that the repertory grid was an effective technique via which to build a rich profile of the fiction reader. Practical implications – This research could inform the development of fiction collections, and its detailed examination of fiction reader profiles could be adapted in three specific ways, as described in the paper. Originality/value – Little previous research has been conducted to differentiate between readers of different fiction genres, and less still for those of minority ethnic fiction genres.

This paper compares the listening experiences of non-experts and the designers of two sound designs. To date, no such comparisons have been examined empirically, and so for ease of comparison, repertory grids were chosen to explore these experiences, which preclude the need for listener training. The results suggest that (a) it is meaningful to compare designers' and non-experts' listening experiences, (b) points of agreement and disagreement are readily identified and (c) the use of repertory grids is a practical means of conducting such studies. The findings further suggest that a taxonomy of sound attributes based on these experiences rather than designers' intuition or predilection is also possible.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Adaptation to extreme weather: identifying different societal perspectives in the Netherlands
AN  - 1491412394
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Climate change and the food production system: impacts and adaptation in China

              
The intensity and occurrence of extreme weather events are expected to change with climate change. This change necessitates adaptive responses to extreme events, which need to take into account different societal perspectives, in order to be robust. In this paper, we explore the perspectives of different social actors in the Netherlands with respect to extreme weather events and ways to adapt to these events. The paper reports on a set of 41 interviews, using the repertory grid technique. The results were analyzed, to identify (a) the perspectives that stakeholders hold as most important for adaptation to extreme weather events; (b) the determinants of differences in perspectives. We find six different perspectives, all of which prioritize different adaptive actions. Producing robust adaptive responses which include different perspectives is therefore not a straightforward matter and is likely to result in win-lose situations. Further, differences in perspectives were not closely related to different sectors the interviewees belonged to. Thus, the traditional approach of involving different sectors to discuss and produce adaptation measures may be too limiting and needs to be supplemented to involving actors with different perspectives. The level of concern and level of information influenced the ways interviewees perceive adaptation priorities for extreme weather events. Participation in information events does not always result in perceived need to prepare for extreme events, something that adaptation communication needs to take into account.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Student constructs of mathematical problems: Problem types, achievement and gender
AN  - 1837592885
AB  - This study aims to understand students' constructs regarding mathematical problems. Fifty-one Taiwanese primary students' constructs are elicited using interviews with the repertory grid technique based on their responses to creative and non-creative problems. The results of qualitative data analysis show that students' initial constructs can be categorized into three cognitive constructs (perception, strategy, and goal, each with deep and surface orientation constructs) and one affective construct. The results of correlation analysis reveal that deep strategy for both creative and non-creative problems and affect for creative problems are related to mathematics achievement. The results of multivariate analysis of variance reveal that students have fewer surface strategies and more surface goals for creative problems than those for non-creative problems. No significant gender differences or interaction effects between problem types and genders occur for either construct. The results reveal implications for teachers in the development of effective pedagogy for teaching different types of mathematical problems.

AB  - Work life quality can be seen as a technique involving both structure and process which focus on the levels of employees rather than levels of management. It might be said that the original use of work life quality indicates the quality of relationship between employee and business environment, and work is intended to emphasize the human dimension which is generally forgotten. Work life quality might be defined as the degree of meeting personal needs and reaching satisfaction of employees in institutions. It is used phenomenological design within the qualitative research approaches in this study which aims to examine the work life quality in schools according to the perceptions of teachers working in primary schools. The participants of this stduy consist of 30 teachers working in the centre of Erzurum determining by using criteria sampling within the purposeful sampling techniques. The data collection instrument used in the study created by the participants themselves on the basis of repertory grid technique. Repertory grid technique is a technique based on cognitive structures theory. Repertory grid form consists of two parts, structure and element. Structure part consists perception of individuals about the related concept; the element part consists six schools which are recognized and known by the participants for each structure. In the analysis of data is used discourse analysis. 300 pieces of cognitive fiction generated by participants found to be distributed according to fiction groups at the levels of the socio-economic structure (n = 26, 8.6%), collaboration (n = 32, 10.6%), physical structure (n = 32, 10.6%), technological infrastructure (n = 20, 6.6%), democratic environment (n = 20, 6.6%), professional support level (n = 24, 8%), social activities (n = 20, 6.6%), fair practices (n = 19, 6.3% ), organizational commitment, (n = 15, 5%), working conditions (n = 49, 16.3%), trusting environment (n = 18, 6%), the quality of interpersonal relationships (n = 26, 8.6%).It is found that the conditions of employees (n=12, 40%), colloboration (n=6, 20%), socioeconomic structure (n=4, 13.3%), physical structure (n=3, 10%), interpersonel relationships (n=3, 10%), organizational commitment (n=1, 3.3%) take place in primary fiction groups. In the light of the findings obtained from this study, it is said that the situations in school related to the work life quality needs to be determined and the studies based on revealing and improvement the weaknesses of existing the work life quality should be given weight. This situation might help providing opportunity to related people and institutions of evaluating schools from a holistic perspective, since it considers the efficiency of employee and organization with which concept of the work life quality gain meaning

T1  - Evaluating the impact of <i>Consent &amp; Capacity: Everyday Decision-Making In Long-Term Care</i> on staff critical thinking disposition
AN  - 1643604907
AB  - The ability to think critically is valuable in all aspects of life, but staff critical thinking (CT) is particularly valuable in the challenging long-term care (LTC) setting where there are numerous, complex factors at play. Innovative continuing education programs are essential to support the development of critical thinking in LTC staff. Consent & Capacity: Everyday Decision-Making in Long-Term Care (C&C ED in LTC), is a short training course that addresses matters relevant to the LTC setting, and assists staff with the development of critical thinking disposition (CTD). This pilot study used a pre-test-post-test mixed methodology design to evaluate the impact of C&C ED in LTC on staff CTD. The California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) was used to measure CTD pre and post-C&C ED in LTC. The Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) was also used to triangulate the findings. There were 53 multidisciplinary staff participants from Lakeview Manor, a LTC facility in Beaverton, Ontario. The findings indicated that C&C ED in LTC may have had a positive impact on the development of CTD in LTC staff. This is important because strong CTD may help staff provide better quality care to residents in the challenging LTC environment and may help staff achieve greater job satisfaction. The CCTDI results showed a significant increase in the Openmindedness scale, mean CTD scores were predominantly in the positive CTD qualitative category, Systematicity scores showed an increase in qualitative CTD category, and there was an increase in percentage of staff scoring in the positive and strong positive CTD categories after participating in C&C ED in LTC for five of the CCTDI scales. The quantitative and qualitative RGT results show some relationships with CTD and the components of C&C ED in LTC. Study strengths and limitations were discussed with suggestions for future directions.

AN  - 1530083921
AB  - A major challenge when researching on people relates to how reliable information can be retrieved from them. It is a matter of how to access what is literally inside people's mind. Access is limited by the cognitive screening process that mediates human interaction, as well as by human rhetoric. We apply repertory grid, laddering and content analysis as an integrated psychometric approach to contrast two sets of constructs: a set of theoretically based constructs about the management of information technology professionals who work in customer teams, and a set of constructs that lie behind those professionals' cognition in the particular case of implementing enterprise-wide systems (ERP). Results confirm the effectiveness of such a methodological approach to accurately reveal cognitive phenomena and to better understand the information technology workforce.

T1  - Experienced Teachers' Construals of the Teacher's Role Across the Historical Process
AN  - 1500435273
AB  - Understanding the role of the public school teacher and how that role has changed over recent history is critical to comprehending the nature of teaching and teachers in American schools. This 2-phase, hypothesis-generating study was undertaken to develop a deeper understanding of the role of the teacher and, in particular, the ways that role has remained stable or changed across the historical process. It explored how the role of the teacher is construed by current, experienced teachers through personal construct systems and through their shared enactments of a social construct system proposed as an extension to personal construct theory. Departing from the traditional disciplinary approaches that have characterized much of the previous research on this topic and which have been limited in scope and method by their associated paradigms, this study adopted an interdisciplinary, mixed methods approach that integrated the perspectives of several disciplines and professional fields. It employed the repertory grid technique (RGT) from personal construct theory to elicit personal constructs from 16 experienced teachers in intensive RGT interviews to identify shared constructs. Those shared constructs were then employed as an inferred social construct system in an anonymous online survey of experienced practicing teachers (n = 258) to identify the ways in which that social construct system is enacted in construing the role of the teacher across the historical process, envisioning the future role of the teacher, and perceiving the ideal role. Latent class analysis indicated heterogeneity in teachers' views regarding the role and substantial perceived change across recent history, suggesting a lack of role consensus. The study also compared the participants' views of the ideal role of the teacher with their expectations for the future. The findings have implications for future research and for educational theory, policy, and practice.   Keywords: education history, repertory grid technique, teacher role

T1  - Consumers' Perceptual Determinants of Acceptance of Innovative Multimodal Mobility Solutions
AN  - 1749937564
AB  - A significant increase of travellers in urban areas leads to requirements and opportunities for policy makers and mobility providers to offer innovative mobility solutions. While reasons for customers to choose between private and public transfer has been researched, the perceptual mental models of consumers regarding traditional and innovative multimodal mobility options are not yet understood. We close this research gap through conducting a repertory grid analysis of perceptual determinants of travel mode choice. Sixty in-depth interviews with urban travellers revealed 28 perceptual constructs related to six distinct categories. Since attributes closely related to private cars like privacy, flexibility and autonomy are key indicators of travel mode choice; costs and time efficiency also play a major role. Our study provides businesses and policy makers with specific design requirements for new multimodal travel modes.

T1  - Emotional and aesthetic attachment to digital artefacts
AN  - 1442358629
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Cognitive Ergonomics for Designing Collaborative Activities

              
We report a pair of repertory grid studies that explore the attachment people have for digital and non-digital artefacts. In the first study we found no clear distinctions between emotional attachment to digital and non-digital artefacts: people are attached to their mobile phones in much the same way as to a childhood teddy bear. There was also evidence that attachment and the physical availability or proximity of the artefact were associated. In the second study we examined the aesthetics of attachment to digital and non-digital artefacts. Again the proximity or availability of the artefacts appeared to be important. Items that were carried about or worn, such as wristwatches and laptops, were closely associated, while TVs and games consoles were not. In all, there does not appear to be any qualitative difference between the attachment people have for digital and non-digital artefacts. Nor do aesthetics appear to play a part in this attachment. However, the physical proximity of these artefacts is strongly associated with our (inward) feelings of attachment to them, while we can also recognise the importance of this relationship to how we (outwardly) present ourselves to the world and others.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing the value dimensions of outsourced maintenance services
AN  - 1439470434
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the diverse nature of tangible and intangible value dimensions that contribute to customers' perception of value from outsourced maintenance services. Design/methodology/approach - A multiple case study approach has been adopted. Repertory grid, an in-depth structured interviewing technique, has been used in order to draw out the respondents' hidden constructs in evaluating outsourced maintenance services. Data have been collected from four customer organizations of outsourced maintenance services, and a total of 33 interviews have been undertaken. Findings - The paper has identified a range of tangible and intangible value dimensions that are of importance in maintenance outsourcing decision making. The most important value dimensions for maintenance outsourcing were found to be specialist knowledge, accessibility (of the service provider), relational dynamic, range of products and services, delivery, pricing and locality. Although the paper has identified the most important value dimensions the paper also emphasizes the need to take into account the full range of value dimensions in order to understand the whole value pattern in an organization. Practical implications - The results will be of use for maintenance service providers to help them to improve value-adding capacity of maintenance services. The results can also be applied by customers to help them assess the value they receive from outsourced maintenance services. Originality/value - A different perspective on maintenance outsourcing value is provided. The value patterns in different organizations and the viewpoints of respondents in different organizational roles are described. The dynamic nature of these tangible or intangible values over time and their interrelationships has also been explored.

T1  - How Lending Officers Construe Assessments of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Loan Applications: A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 1411667860
AB  - Repertory grid technique and principal component analysis were used to map and analyze how 75 lending officers (LOs) viewed their assessments of small and medium-sized enterprises' loan applications in one bank and region. A standard set of elements and constructs, derived during pre- and pilot studies, was used. Analysis of individual grids demonstrated that the principal components indicated the existence of similarities in LOs' construing at an aggregated level. Analysis of the mean grid of all respondents indicated that the LOs were encouraged by the bank's lending strategy and supporting system(s) to perform "procedural lending" with a focus on hard and future-oriented information. At the same time, the LOs deemphasized relationship lending, in particular, personal relationships. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Classification of human resources based on measurement of tacit knowledge
AN  - 1354991674
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate employees of an organization in order to evaluate and classify them based on their tacit knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, staff's tacit knowledge is measured at the individual level, in automotive sector. Design/methodology/approach - Repertory grid technique has been used as a mechanism to aid the elicitation and evaluation of individuals' personal constructs. Then, Pathfinder analysis was carried out to examine the individual's knowledge structure. The similarities between knowledge structure of expert and novice was measured by the set-theoretic index C, in order to classify staff and ultimately, for analysis of each group, Idiogrid software was used. Findings - Based on closeness index, all employees were classified into four categories. Respondent's perceptions were evaluated by comparing the mental model graphs of the individuals in different categories with experts' graphs. Ultimately, the best or the most effective HR practices were determined for managing knowledge workers. Research limitations/implications - This study may help HRM department to differentiate between low and high-performing employees for determining the most effective HR practices to manage staff. Furthermore, it has significant implications in team building and designing a knowledge map within organizations. Originality/value - This paper reveals effective linkages between human resource management and knowledge management.

T1  - Identifying attributes required by Foundation Year 1 doctors in multidisciplinary teams: a tool for performance evaluation
AN  - 1778810452
AB  - Background

              
Effective working in multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) is promoted as essential in ensuring good healthcare outcomes, suggesting that an understanding exists of the relationship between outcomes and the attributes needed by individuals to function effectively in the MDT. While the characteristics of effective teamwork have been described, the attributes needed by individual MDT members have not been investigated. To address this, the study focuses on newly qualified Foundation Year 1 (FY1) doctors, creating and testing a tool to evaluate their performance in the MDT.

              
Methods

              
Repertory grid technique was used to elicit attributes needed by FY1 doctors to function effectively in the MDT. Study participants (all experienced MDT members) used these to evaluate MDT working by FY1 doctor colleagues. Data on 57 FY1 doctors were collected from 95 MDT members working in five hospitals. Participants also ranked the attributes in terms of importance for effective team functioning and rated an 'Ideal' FY1 doctor.

              
Results

              
The repertory grid permitted differentiation between groups of FY1 doctors' MDT performance. FY1 doctors who undertook interprofessional training were rated no differently than UK-trained graduates without such training. UK-trained graduates were rated significantly higher on all attributes than non-UK-trained graduates. Overall, FY1 doctors were rated lower than the 'Ideal'. Factor analysis and rankings suggested tensions between clinical attributes needed for good team functioning and more 'social' attributes.

              
Conclusions

              
This study demonstrates the potential of repertory grid methodology in eliciting attributes that are important for effective teamworking, and using these to evaluate MDT working by FY1 doctors.

T1  - Categorizing stakeholders' practices with repertory grids for sustainable development
AN  - 1424323032
AB  - In this paper, the authors put forward a method for categorizing stakeholder diversity as a means to facilitate managers' discussions of sustainability issues. Their general contribution is to conduct a stakeholder analysis based on the stakeholders' practices instead of their power and interests, the latter being a more usual focus. Their mapping method consists in codifying stakeholders' practices within an inductive procedure that is deeply rooted in what they currently do rather than literature-driven categories. More specifically, they adapt the well-known repertory-grid technique to represent practices on qualitative scales. Using several working groups dealing with rural sustainability issues, this method has proved effective in collectively building repertories of practices and stakeholder categories. They show that the method is helpful to participants in that it extends their representations of stakeholders and helps them to reframe sustainability. While contributing to practice-based studies, this paper also contributes methodologically to empirical studies on collective problem structuring concerning sustainability issues.

T1  - A Personal Construct Approach to Understanding Stress in Mothers of Children Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders
AN  - 1151997112
AB  - This study explored the contribution of personal construct psychology (PCP) and the repertory grid technique to understanding stress when raising a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Associations between child level of functional impairment, parenting stress, psychological distress, and maternal construing were examined in mothers of 25 children diagnosed with ASD. Results suggest that a personal construct perspective may help delineate factors involved in parent adjustment to ASD. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The present study uses personal construct theory and the repertory grid technique to examine staff views of individual clients with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, in particular those clients who purge and restrict. Fourteen members of nursing staff, both qualified and non-qualified, participated in the research. The results suggest that the 14 members of staff interviewed did construe clients who purge and clients who restrict in markedly different ways. The theoretical implications of this finding are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Personal Construction of Cough Medicine among Young Substance Abusers in Hong Kong
AN  - 2036320660
AB  - Although cough medicine abuse is a growing problem in many places, there is no study examining the views of young substance abusers toward cough medicine. The objective of this study was to examine personal constructions of cough medicine abusers via the repertory grid tests (																					N								=								11																		). Several observations are highlighted from the study. First, personal constructions of cough medicine were mixed, including the benefits and harmful effects of its abuse. Second, although the informants perceived cough medicine to be addictive and harmful, they perceived cough medicine to be less addictive and less harmful than did heroin. Third, while the informants construed cough medicine to be similar to ketamine and marijuana, they also perceived cough medicine to possess some characteristics of heroin. Fourth, relative to the construed similarity between heroin and the gateway drugs (cigarette, beer, and liquor), the informants construed cough medicine to be more similar to the gateway drugs. Finally, a higher level of perceived dissimilarity between cough medicine and gateway drugs was related to a higher level of perceived harm of cough medicine abuse.

T1  - Small-Business Owner-Managers' Perceptions of Business Ethics and CSR-Related Concepts: JBE JBE
AN  - 840670181
AB  - Recent academic articles point to an increased vagueness and overlap in concepts related to business ethics and corporate responsibility. Further, the perception of these notions can differ in the small-business world from the original academic definitions. This article focuses on the cognition of small-business owner-managers. Given the impact of small-business owner-managers on their ventures, corporate responsibility and ethical issues can take a different route in SMEs. The small-business owner-manager is able to shape the corporate culture and to enact values other than profit. Adopting a cognitive perspective, we have identified how the small-business owner-manager makes sense of notions linked to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business ethics. The concept of sensemaking has recently been applied to CSR (Basu and Pallazzo, 2008; Cramer et al., 2006). Applying a cognitive perspective to small-business owners may help in explaining specific phenomena found within small-business ownership. For this research, the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) is used, a method that has not previously been widely applied in the business and society field.              Our findings to an extent invalidate the confusion in terminology found in the academic literature. Small-business owner-managers, pragmatically and rather clearly, differentiate among the various concepts related to corporate responsibility and business ethics but, at the same time, they recognise the interrelationships and interdependencies of these concepts. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how small-business owners think and integrate corporate responsibility and ethical issues into their decision-making.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Use of the Repertory Grid for Collaboration and Reflection in a Research Context
AN  - 745954547
AB  - The Repertory Grid (RepGrid) technique has been used extensively in Management Sciences research, including Information Systems research, in order to reveal the personal views of individual research subjects regarding the issue being studied. These individual constructs are then used to propose criteria for success amongst other things. This paper uses a distinctly different form of RepGrid, renamed a Reflection Grid, as a collaboration tool. Members of a research team use this new technique to probe their individual understanding of what happened and what was achieved during a research event and then to share these insights. Hence, not only is the application new (reflection and construction of shared meaning rather than the analysis and synthesis of personal constructs) but the original grid technique has evolved.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - "Catch me if you can?": A psychological analysis of managers' feedback seeking
AN  - 215871577
AB  - This paper aims to locate managerial feedback-seeking in a self-regulation model in which self-motivational considerations are uppermost. It seeks to use a qualitative psychological approach to address the question of when, what, how, from whom and why is feedback sought in a performance contingent managerial setting.  Using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique, ten managers reflected systematically on their feedback seeking in an organizational context. A grounded theory framework was used to identify higher-order cross-case constructs.  Managers sought performance feedback when they perceived uncertainty and difficulty in the pursuit of their managerial functions and were minded of their need to develop their management skills. Consistent with the instrumental model, feedback seeking was highly goal-oriented and self-affirmative in pursuit of increased managerial competence. However, the finding that adds most to the understanding on both an empirical and theoretical level is in showing how managers sought their feedback remotely, and from largely external sources, to reconcile development needs with self-protective considerations (i.e. image and ego-costs) in relation to subordinates and peers. These findings have implications for understanding feedback seeking as a multi-dimensional highly self-motivated process.  Qualitative research uses small samples and this limits their empirical generalizability; however, the paper's findings link with previous work indicating potential for hypothesis generation and theoretical development.  Questions are raised about whether managers feel able to seek performance feedback for learning and development purposes, without feeling threatened in their capability and worth as managers. The paper argues that the environment most conducive to feedback seeking is one in which managers feel "psychologically safe" rather than defensive about their capability.

T1  - Identifying Competencies of Volunteer Board Members of Community Sports Clubs
AN  - 1928876949
AB  - This study contributes to the emerging empirical studies on roles and responsibilities of boards in nonprofit organizations by identifying competencies of volunteer board members. We identified how two types of constituents--volunteer board members and sports members--perceived competencies of volunteer board members in community sports clubs. We used the repertory grid technique to draw cognitive maps and to reveal the perceived reality of these constituents. Our results suggest that constituents within a group share similar perceptions of competencies of outstanding performing board members, whereas they agree less on perceptions of poor performing board members. This study reveals that cognitive (e.g., having a long-term vision, having professionalism), emotional intelligence (e.g., being reliable, being honest), and social intelligence (e.g., listening to others, being jovial/nice to be with) competencies are necessary to be perceived as an outstanding performing board member.

T1  - General practitioners' perceptions of the effectiveness of medical interventions: an exploration of underlying constructs
AN  - 902306751; 20158896
AB  - Abstract

              
Background: Many interventions shown to be effective through clinical trials are not readily implemented in clinical practice. Unfortunately, little is known regarding how clinicians construct their perceptions of the effectiveness of medical interventions. This study aims to explore general practitioners' perceptions of the nature of 'effectiveness'.

              
Methods: The design was qualitative in nature using the repertory grid technique to elicit the constructs underlying the perceived effectiveness of a range of medical interventions. Eight medical interventions were used as stimuli (diclophenac to reduce acute pain, cognitive behaviour therapy to treat depression, weight loss surgery to achieve weight loss, diet and exercise to prevent type 2 diabetes, statins to prevent heart disease, stopping smoking to prevent heart disease, nicotine replacement therapy to stop smoking, and stop smoking groups to stop smoking). The setting involved face-to-face interviews followed by questionnaires in London Primary Care Trusts. Participants included a random sample of 13 general practitioners.

              
Results: Analysis of the ratings showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: low patient effort versus high patient effort (dimension one), and small impact versus large impact (dimension two). Dimension one represented constructs such as 'success requires little motivation', 'not a lifestyle intervention', and 'health-care professional led intervention'. Dimension two represented constructs such as 'weak and/or minimal evidence of effectiveness', 'small treatment effect for users', 'a small proportion of users will benefit' and 'not cost-effective'. Constructs within each dimension were closely related.

              
Conclusions: General practitioners judged the effectiveness of medical interventions by considering two broad dimensions: the extent to which interventions involve patient effort, and the size of their impact. The latter is informed by trial evidence, but the patient effort required to achieve effectiveness seems to be based on clinical judgement. Some of the failure of evidence-based medicine to be implemented may be more explicable if both dimensions were attended to.

T1  - Developing results-based leadership attributes and team cohesiveness through action learning
AN  - 741546553
AB  - Those who develop leaders in manufacturing settings have little data that describe the usefulness of action learning as a method of developing leaders’ abilities to improve results-based leadership attributes or perceptions about their team’s cohesiveness. The two purposes of this study were to evaluate an action learning program with regards to its (a) usefulness in promoting results-based leadership attributes and (b) modification of team cohesiveness perceptions. The conceptual framework is founded upon a nexus of action learning, results-based leadership attributes, and team cohesiveness in the context of leadership development with the entire population of a 12-member team. Action learning utilizes adult learning concepts and combines contingency and transformational leadership theories. The research questions inquire how such a program improves the demonstration of the attributes and modifies personal psychological constructs of team cohesiveness. Archival records, interviews, journals, and repertory grids were used to collect qualitative data for analysis. Analyses were carried out through thematic coding of categorical aggregation and identification of patterns. Findings indicated that leadership team members thought small groups and vicarious learning experiences, developed through open sharing, were found to be useful, but cohesiveness of the group did not improve. The results of this research may provide positive social impact through influencing leaders who affect the lives of employees. Since many organizations use team structures, it is important that the teams be as effective as they can be. If leaders can help teams function more effectively, they will be more productive for the organization and society as a whole.

T1  - An investigation into digital media: Characteristics of learning objects which K–12 teachers determine meet their instructional needs
AN  - 619971451
AB  - In recent years, learning objects have emerged as an instructional tool for teachers. Digital libraries and collections provide teachers with free or fee-base access to a variety of learning objects from photos and famous speeches to Flash animations and interactive Java Applets. Learning objects offer opportunities for students to interact with digital media in ways that can bring concepts and ideas to life. Students can visualize what changes in matter might look like and practice math skills like multiplying decimals. They can even receive instant feedback and interact with tutorials as many times as needed.    The purpose of this mixed methods study is to examine how K-12 teachers determine the characteristics of learning objects that meet their instructional needs. Capturing snapshots of what characteristics of learning objects that successful K-12 teachers select may lead to a clearer picture that could advance the use of learning objects in the classroom. By incorporating learning objects into their instructional practices, teachers can enhance their instruction as well as demonstrate to media savvy students how to use readily available learning objects to express and communicate what they've learned.    In order to identify the characteristics of learning objects that teachers deem useful, a small sample of K-12 teachers experienced in using learning objects were interviewed using the Repertory Grid Technique. This technique is used to elicit personal constructs. In this study, a representative group of learning objects were examined to elicit constructs or characteristics about learning objects with regard to instructional use. The resulting learning object characteristics were analyzed to determine if the characteristics deemed useful by teachers are aligned to the characteristics that learning object designers use.

T1  - Reconsideration of the Bank Credit Assessment Decision: Theoretical and Practical Issues
AN  - 1697566917
AB  - "The purpose of this paper is to discuss conceptual issues related to the bank credit assessment decision in the context of current events in the financial markets. To add to the theoretical discussion, a case study of a large Swedish bank will be conducted and data will be captured and then analyzed with the repertory grid technique. Additionally, information will be collected through interviews with about 60 bank managers or bank loan officers to allow statistical analyses. Similarities and differences between groups of bank loan officers (e.g. senior experts and novices) are important to identify in the context of current events. To add validity to this study, a ìco-researchî approach will be used by involving the bank managers and bank loan officers in analyzing and interpreting the results. Attempts will be made to identify any differences in the decision approaches of bank managers and bank loan officers pre- and post- the current financial crisis. The credit assessment decision processes will be examined by focusing on the initial encounter between the applicant and the bank loan officer who generates the first screening of the application. Information will be gathered regarding the identity of information used by the suppliers of credit in order to evaluate loan applications for approval or rejection and how this information can be categorized to enhance comparability between application cases, borrowers and personal attributes for bank loan officers. Theoretically the research rests upon financial theory, institutional theory, structuration, sense-making, accountability and cognitive theory. The conference paper outlines the methods to be used, discusses advantages and limitations with respect to validity and reliability of the methods, and tests the repertory grid technique on one respondent in a pre-study. It is concluded that the planned approach is feasible.""

T1  - Eliciting Cognitions of Strategizing Using Advanced Repertory Grids in a World Constructed and Reconstructed
AN  - 1928217279
AB  - Previous application of the repertory grid technique in the strategy field has been noteworthy. However, all have been imprisoned by their adherence to strict element choice based on grid protocol. Elements in past studies have either focused on all competitor companies, or all strategic decisions, or all decision makers, or all strategic issues, inter alia, in an effort to learn more about how strategists see, interpret, and make sense of their strategy experiences. This research note outlines how current strategy research can be advanced by the use of more heterogeneous elements for grid applications, hence allowing researchers to go deeper into eliciting more complex strategic cognitions on how strategy is crafted and recrafted in a world constructed and reconstructed.

T1  - Investigating project managers' work values by repertory grids interviews
AN  - 216306518
AB  - The purpose of the research is to investigate project managers' work values and their relationship with project managers' competence. In this research, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews using repertory grid techniques on 18 Chinese project managers. Three different approaches are utilised to analyse data obtained from the interviews. The authors categorised work values with different perspectives. Project managers' core work values are identified. The authors recommend that work values are an important dimension in relation to project manager's competence. The understanding of a project manager's work values has a potential application in human resources development and competence-based management development. This paper presents an innovative approach to the investigation of a project manager's competence.

T1  - Attributes of identity document credibility: A synthesis of expert knowledge
AN  - 304800848
AB  - In broad terms — including a thief's use of existing credit card, bank, or other accounts — the number of identity fraud victims in the United States ranges 9-10 million per year, or roughly 4% of the US adult population. The average annual theft per stolen identity was estimated at $6,383 in 2006, up approximately 22% from $5,248 in 2003; an increase in estimated total theft from $53.2 billion in 2003 to $56.6 billion in 2006. About three million Americans each year fall victim to the worst kind of identity fraud: new account fraud. Names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and other data are acquired fraudulently from the issuing organization, or from the victim then these data are used to create fraudulent identity documents. In turn, these are presented to other organizations as evidence of identity, used to open new lines of credit, secure loans, “flip” property, or otherwise turn a profit in a victim's name. This is much more time consuming — and typically more costly — to repair than fraudulent use of existing accounts.    This research borrows from well-established theoretical backgrounds, in an effort to answer the question – what is it that makes identity documents credible? Most importantly, identification of the components of credibility draws upon personal construct psychology, the underpinning for the repertory grid technique, a form of structured interviewing that arrives at a description of the interviewee’s constructs on a given topic, such as credibility of identity documents. This represents substantial contribution to theory, being the first research to use the repertory grid technique to elicit from experts, their mental constructs used to evaluate credibility of different types of identity documents reviewed in the course of opening new accounts. The research identified twenty-one characteristics, different ones of which are present on different types of identity documents. Expert evaluations of these documents in different scenarios suggest that visual characteristics are most important for a physical document, while authenticated personal data are most important for a digital document.

T1  - Self, group, and society: Emergence of new political identities in the Republic of Macedonia
AN  - 304496604
AB  - The Republic of Macedonia provides an illustration of how a society's identities reciprocally affect government and politics. This research investigates the extent to which Macedonia is developing a stable and cohesive society and contrasts more traditional investigations that treat identity as coextensive with fixed ethnic boundaries. This study employs an inductive approach to identity formation by investigating how individual beliefs and values function within a society. To accomplish this, a method for discerning and characterizing identity groups was employed, generating a rich mixture of qualitative and quantitative data.    Fieldwork took place in two stages in 2005-2006. In stage one, university students across Macedonia (n=109) were interviewed using an adaptation of George Kelly's repertory grid technique, a semi-structured interview procedure. In stage two, a national follow-up survey (n=496) based on those findings was administered to a random sample of Macedonia's general population, allowing for an evaluation of initial results. Multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, generalized procrustes analysis, and a measure of cognitive homophily were employed to identify and assess similarities and differences among identity groups. This multitier approach made it possible to discern unifying themes that contribute to the previously unrecognized growth in civic identity that is beginning to span ethnic divisions in Macedonia. Although ethnic designations remain important to the assessment of identity, research findings support the contention that emergent identities in this new state are not categorically deterministic. This implies that some members of society are developing identities more strongly associated with Macedonia's viability as a state than with ethnic and other designations.    The methodology employed in this study offers an emic perspective that permits inductively derived comparisons, rather than etic comparisons that limit investigations to easily identifiable fixed categories. The emit methodology, operationalized through the repertory grid technique and Kelly's theory of constructivist alternativism, elicits culturally relevant frames of reference in a manner that preserves the meanings attached by members of society while minimizing the effects of the researcher's own cultural and intellectual biases. This is a promising methodology for investigating potentially emergent identities in other regions and communities where cultural misconceptions pose potential barriers to societal stability.

T1  - Constructing urban green spaces: an application of Kelly's repertory grid
AN  - 1012272555
AB  - Purpose - Urban green spaces are valuable to residents for a variety of reasons and some degree of management is needed to ensure at least their preservation, if not enhancement, in a rapidly urbanising society. Intensification of the urban environment brings pressure upon the undeveloped spaces within a city and an understanding of the needs of residents is needed if green spaces are to be managed in alignment with their wishes, so that changes will be accepted. However, gaining such an understanding of the complex relationships between people and their environment is difficult. Constructs may exist that researcher, respondent, or both have not yet articulated. This paper sets out to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach - The repertory grid method is described as an approach that addresses this problem by researcher and respondent collectively, creating a survey instrument, which the respondent then completes. Findings - The repertory grid technique was applied in Zurich and revealed a surprisingly dominant anthropocentric attitude towards urban green spaces. Practical/implications - The universal anthropocentric perspective allows the interpretation that residents see Zurich essentially as a place for people and furthermore see green spaces as places for themselves to pursue their own interests. Originality/value - Application of this technique, in the context of an exploratory study, simultaneously provides direction for further research and demonstrates its utility as a tool for planners and managers of urban green spaces.

T1  - THE APPLICATION OF PERSONAL CONSTRUCT THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING RESEARCH
AN  - 195123376
AB  - The Personal Construct Theory is applied to assess the contribution that this methodology can make to the understanding of international accounting harmonization. The study was conducted in Taiwan and eight in-depth interviews were conducted with individuals directly responsible for standard setting. The RepGrid was used to collect data and provide an analytical structure for interpreting data from the interviews. The study illustrates how the concepts and procedures of PCT were applied at each stage of the research - from the initial research design to the analysis of the data. The study concludes that Taiwanese regulators perceive potential risks in adopting fully IFRs and mechanisms are used to reduce this risk that has resulted in a 3-part system of standard setting. it also claims that PCT and RepGrid offer conceptual and methodological opportunities to the accounting researcher, but there are challenges in its application.

T1  - Using the repertory grid and laddering technique to determine the user's evaluative model of search engines
AN  - 217962931
AB  - Purpose  - The purpose of this research is to explore a method for the determination of users' representations of search engines, formed during their interaction with these systems. Determines the extent to which these elicited "mental models" indicate the system aspects of importance to the user and from this their evaluative view of these tools. Design/methodology/approach  - The repertory grid technique is used to elicit a set of constructs that define facets within the mental model of an individual. A related technique of laddering then considers each of the user's constructs to determine the reasons for its importance within the user's mental model. Findings  - The model derived from the qualitative data comprises three hierarchical strata and conveys the interrelations between basic system description, evaluative description, and the key evaluations of ease, efficiency, effort and effectiveness. Two additional layers relating to the perceived process and the experience of emotion are also discussed. Research limitations/implications  - Ten participants is considered to be optimum for obtaining constructs in a repertory grid, but limits the findings to the context of the user group and the systems used in this study. Originality/value  - The methodology has not previously been used to determine mental models of search engines and from these to understand users' evaluative view of systems. The resulting model of key evaluations with the conjunctions of procedural elements suggests a framework for further research to evaluate search engines from the user perspective.

T1  - Managers' perceptions of learning in new product development
AN  - 232327532
AB  - Post-project reviews (PPRs) are widely recommended as an appropriate mechanism to stimulate project-to-project learning in new product development (NPD) teams. However, empirical research on their potential is limited and so this study aims to answer two questions: how do NPD professionals perceive PPRs and is tacit knowledge created during PPRs? Five in-depth case studies were conducted in German companies. The main sources of data were: company documentation; in-depth interviews with managers; and observation of PPRs. The different data sources enabled extensive data triangulation and a high degree of reliability and validity to be achieved. The results indicate that NPD personnel perceive PPRs to be a very useful mechanism. They also show that social interactions and tacit knowledge play key roles in NPD learning. Tacit knowledge was investigated using a proxy measure - the usage of metaphors and stories in NPD discussions and documents. More robust ways of studying the generation and transfer of tacit knowledge are needed. The whole area of knowledge and learning in NPD requires significant further study. Management needs to drive the dissemination of the results of PPRs more effectively, in order to make more use of the tacit knowledge generated.

T1  - TAIWANESE REGULATORS' PERCEPTIONS OF ACCOUNTING CONVERGENCE
AN  - 208151538
AB  - This paper constructs the 'mental maps' of eight Taiwanese regulators responsible for accounting convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards. A phenomenological paradigm is adopted and the Repertory Grid Technique used for in-depth interviews. The results demonstrate that the regulators experience tension in their roles as advocates of convergence and guardians of the existing system. The perceived need to protect business interests, combined with the residual influence of standards issued by the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board, as well as insufficient resources, have led to a tripartite structure of standards.

T1  - Experiences Conducting Cross-Cultural Research
AN  - 195151585
AB  - When conducting cross-cultural investigations, it is incumbent upon the information systems researcher to be prepared to reflect upon the differences between the frameworks of the researcher and the research participants. Three cross-cultural projects are discussed in this article. The first project, investigating systems analysts, employs the Repertory Grid from Personal Construct Theory (Kelly, 1955, 1963). The second and third projects both employ Narrative Inquiry (Bruner, 1990). The second project investigates the use of information systems by small business and relies upon multiple regional researchers. The third project, which is currently ongoing, investigates the emerging role of chief information officers and is a single researcher venture. These projects have contributed to the information systems field of study and are presented here to provide researchers with ideas for further qualitative cross-cultural investigations.

T1  - Gossip and emotion in nursing and health-care organizations
AN  - 197381746; 16206920
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between gossip and emotion in health-care organizations. It draws on findings from empirical research exploring the characteristics and function of gossip which, to date, has been a relatively under-researched organizational phenomenon. A multidisciplinary approach was adopted, drawing on an eclectic range of discipline-based theories, skills, ideas and data. Methods included repertory grid technique, in-depth interviews and structured diary records of work-related gossip. The sample comprised 96 qualified nurses working in a range of practice areas and organizational settings in the UK. Template analysis was used to integrate findings across three phases of data collection. The findings revealed that gossip is used to express a range of emotions including care and concern about others, anger, annoyance and anxiety, with emotional outcomes that include feeling reassured and supported. It is the individual who gossips, while the organization provides the content, emotional context, triggers and opportunities. Nurses were chosen as an information-rich source of data, but the findings may simply reflect the professional culture and practice of nursing. Future research should take into account a wider range of health-care organizational roles and perspectives in order to capture the dynamics and detail of the emotions and relationships that initiate and sustain gossip. Because gossip makes people feel better it may serve to reinforce the "stress mask of professionalism", hiding issues of conflict, vulnerability and intense emotion. Managers need to consider what the emotions expressed through gossip might represent in terms of underlying issues relating to organizational health, communication and change. This paper makes a valuable contribution to the under-researched phenomenon of gossip in organizations and adds to the growing field of research into the role of emotion in health-care organizations and emotion work in nursing.

T1  - Leading with integrity: a qualitative research study
AN  - 197366841; 15588012
AB  - This research paper gives an account of a study into the relationship between leadership and integrity. There is a critical analysis of the current literature for effective, successful and ethical leadership particularly, integrity. The purpose and aim of this paper is to build on the current notions of leadership within the literature, debate contemporary approaches, focussing specifically on practices within the UK National Health Service in the early 21st century. This leads to a discussion of the literature on ethical leadership theory, which includes public service values, ethical relationships and leading with integrity. A small study was undertaken consisting of 18 interviews with leaders and managers within a District General Hospital. Using the Repertory Grid technique and analysis 15 themes emerged from the constructs elicited, which were compared to the literature for leadership and integrity and other studies. As well as finding areas of overlap, a number of additional constructs were elicited which suggested that effective leadership correlates with integrity and the presence of integrity will improve organisational effectiveness. The study identified that perceptions of leadership character and behaviour are used to judge the effectiveness and integrity of a leader. However, the ethical implications and consequences of leaders' scope of power and influence such as policy and strategy are somewhat neglected and lacking in debate. The findings suggest that leaders are not judged according to the ethical nature of decision making, and leading and managing complex change but that the importance of integrity and ethical leadership correlated with higher levels of hierarchical status and that it is assumed by virtue of status and success that leaders lead with integrity. Finally, the findings of this study seem to suggest that nurse leadership capability is developing as a consequence of recent national investment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Competitiveness and consumer preferences of U.S. fruits in Taiwan
AN  - 197427038
AB  - This study utilizes the source-position-performance framework to examine the competitiveness and consumer preferences of U.S. fruits versus Taiwanese fruits in the local markets based on the views of retailers and consumers. Retailers who sell relatively more U.S. fresh fruits over total values of fruit sales favor the characteristics of U.S. fresh fruits. Consumers do not value the relative importance of characteristics of U.S. fresh fruits as much as retailers do. Strategic marketing plans need to be designed for both retailers and consumers to strengthen the acceptance of U.S. fresh fruits. A well-balanced promotion strategy emphasizing the overall superiority of profit-driven characteristics of U.S. fruits may encourage retailers to sell more U.S. fresh fruits. Highlighting information related to price and freshness of U.S. fruits may stimulate consumers to purchase more U.S. fresh fruits. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The brand images of tourism destinations: A study of the saliency of organic images
AN  - 220604538
AB  - Assesses the relative saliency of image attributes associated with history, heritage and culture in shaping the perceptions of places as tourism destinations. Such images tend to have been formed over a long period of time and result from exposure to communication processes largely outside marketing's core sphere of influence such as education, literature and the arts. Images formed in this way are referred to in this paper as organic images. The research used the repertory grid technique developed by George A. Kelly in the context of Personal Construct Theory combined with depth interviews to elicit the attributes associated with the images of 25 destinations in the UK. The study identified 11 categories of image attribute. Those associated with a destination's history, heritage and culture were found to be the second most salient category. The implications of these findings are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 236359160
AB  - Teachers' beliefs influence the acceptance and uptake of new approaches, techniques, and activities, and therefore play an important part in teacher development. Consequently, trainers running teacher education courses should consider encouraging participants to think about their personal beliefs and theories about teaching before providing input. This article proposes the use of an instrument designed to elicit teachers' beliefs based on Kelly's (1969) theory of personal constructs, using an adapted version of his repertory grid technique.

T1  - Eliciting and analysing employees' expectations of a merger
AN  - 231482823
AB  - The merger of the head offices of two public service organizations in Sweden was used to examine difference in the meanings that employees attach to the organizations involved and their expectations of the new merger organization, nine month prior to the merger. A two-stage methodology was used, combining the repertory grid method with a survey questionnaire based on the elicited constructs. Predictions from a social constructionist perspective on culture and social identify theory were largely confirmed. The results showed that both groups expected one of them to be dominant after the merger. Member of this organizations expected to change very little, while employees in the non-dominant group felt themselves to be threatened by the prospect of merger and this led them to emphasize theory own distinctiveness. The findings suggest that the success of the integration process after a merger is critically dependent on how employees of mergers partners perceive the culture of the organizations involved and the expectations they have of the new organization. The study has practical implications for how to manager the merger integration process.

T1  - Using repertory grid to identify intangibles in business plans
AN  - 221918849
AB  - The assessment of intangibles in business plans by investors is an important factor of recent interest, particularly in the evaluation of early-stage technology-based ventures. On one hand, investors are challenged to properly assess new opportunities. At the same time, entrepreneurs or innovators face the formidable task of communicating what is, sometimes, nothing more than just an 'extraordinary' idea. In such situations, the decision to continue with the due diligence process, and finally to invest, is based frequently on those aspects that are intangible. In an attempt to reveal some of the intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs, an investigation was conducted using repertory grid, a technique based on personal construct psychology. Five venture capitalists and five entrepreneurs were interviewed. Evidence was found for the importance of intangibles during the investment-decision process of early stage technology-based ventures. For these ventures, the consideration of only tangible criteria is not a guaranteed predictor of success. The repertory grid technique makes a significant contribution to the identification of intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs.

T1  - The use of repertory grid analysis to elicit salient short-break holiday destination attributes in New Zealand
AN  - 217443448
AB  - Repertory grid analysis was developed almost 50 years ago, but its application in destination image research has been rare. The technique was used to identify 17 attributes deemed salient to New Zealanders, when differentiating domestic short-break holiday destinations. These were then compared to those attributes used in 84 previous destination studies, as well as with results from personal interviews with tourism practitioners. A number of differences between the repertory grid findings and practitioner opinion confirmed the value of seeking consumer input when developing attribute lists for use in structured surveys. While both the repertory grid findings and practitioner opinion showed a general consistency with the range of 100+ attributes used in the literature, key differences highlighted the importance of the New Zealand domestic travel context. The article attempts to demonstrate the efficacy of repertory grid, an economical technique that has been underused by tourism market researchers.

T1  - Perceptual dimensions of performance management systems in the eyes of different sample categories
AN  - 233231044
AB  - Past appraisal perception research identify the differences in satisfaction levels towards system effectiveness. But none of them probe into the mental psyche of their respondents to uncover the true core deep-seated perceptual dimensions that influence all other constructions. This study uses the repertory grid technique to elicit personal constructs of how practicing managers experience appraisals in their own organizations. Results show that different sample categories held fundamentally different cognitions when evaluating the effectiveness of performance management systems. Implications to theory and practice are outlined.

T1  - Assessment of the effects of user characteristics on mental models of information retrieval systems
AN  - 231524512
AB  - This article reports the results of a study that investigated effects of four user characteristics on users' mental models of information retrieval systems: educational and professional status, first language, academic background, and computer experience. The repertory grid technique was used in the study. Using this method, important components of information retrieval systems were represented by nine concepts, based on four IR experts' judgments. Users' mental models were represented by factor scores that were derived from users' matrices of concept ratings on different attributes of the concepts. The study found that educational and professional status, academic background, and computer experience had significant effects in differentiating users on their factor scores. First language had a borderline effect, but the effect was not significant.

T1  - Effective leadership behaviour: leading "the third way" from a primary care group perspective - A study of leadership constructs elicited from members of primary care group management boards
AN  - 197376504
AB  - The UK National Health Service (NHS) is undergoing cataclysmic change following the election of the first Labour Government in 18 years. This is primarily embodied in the implementation of the White Paper The New NHS Modern-Dependable, which has resulted in the creation of primary care groups (PCGs) and primary care trusts (PCTs). The task facing both PCGs and PCTs is a radically new and complex one, requiring a new set of leadership skills to the traditional command and control style management. Leadership theories have evolved over the past 70 years. However, it was not until the 1980s that a major change in the paradigm of thinking around what is the nature of leadership occurred. The interaction between the leader and his/her followers is explored in what has become known as transformational leadership theories, developed by Bass and Avolio. Recent studies have, however, questioned the applicability of leadership models derived in the US, to other cultures. This paper explores the leadership behaviors required for the management boards of PCGs and PCTs.

T1  - Factors affecting information systems' success
AN  - 233642918
AB  - There is continuing difficulty in achieving success with information systems, particularly in the sense of meeting users' expectations and offers a fresh examination of those attributes of information systems by which users perceive success and failure, and through which they establish their expectations. Existing research literature is reviewed and it is suggested that, in addition to the process and product viewpoint, an important factor in achieving success is the service management perspective. Repertory grid techniques are applied to uncover a total of 43 constructs which relate to users' perceptions of success with information systems in business. These are reduced to 21 attributes which provide the basis of a new assessment and measurement framework, incorporating and augmenting the attributes found in previous work in this area.

T1  - A Repertory Grid Test of the Claim That Sense of Landscape Naturalness Is Specific to Culture
AN  - 1987643753
AB  - Repertory grid technique was used to test the claim that sense of landscape naturalness is socially constructed and culturally relative, and the reverse claim that sense of landscape naturalness is underlain by universals of human thought. Participants made judgments of sameness and difference concerning elements in a standard landscape of nine elements. Sample groups represented three cultures at extremes along a continuum of ideology concerning human relations with nature: Euro-Canadian at one end, Vuntut Gwich'in and north Baffin Inuit at the other. Results were consistent with the universalist but not the relativist hypothesis. Although principal factors for the three culture samples differ slightly, a common factor is nested within the variation, and it corresponds to the Euro-Canadian construct (natural x man-made). The study has implications for environmental education and environmental planning.

T1  - Subjective constructs and first appraisal in women with breast cancer
AN  - 304168936
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe patterns of personal cognitive constructs and first appraisal in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. A framework integrating the Folkman and Lazarus coping model (1984) and Kelly's Personal Construct Theory (1955) guided this study.    Sixty-two women from five different Italian regional hospitals participated in the study. Subjects were interviewed just prior to breast surgery. Breast surgery consisted of lumpectomy. Personal cognitive constructs were elicited during in-depth face-to-face interviews using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique (Kelly, 1955). First appraisal was measured using a visual analog scale with an investigator developed self report questionnaire. The basis for the questionnaire was Lazarus' three appraisal categories: Challenge, Threat, and Harm/Loss (Lazarus & Folkman, 1985). First appraisal was assessed both as perceived during the interview and as remembered by the subject immediately after the diagnosis. Demographic data were collected using an investigator designed demographic data form. Subjects were interviewed between 1 to 10 weeks following diagnosis. Fifty-two subjects were interviewed prior to the surgery, 10 were interviewed following surgery.    Many events used by the women to elicit their cognitive constructs were similar. The category "Challenge" was referred to by the majority of the women as the most intense at the time of the interview; based on the participant's memory, "Challenge" was also described by the majority as the most intense immediately following the diagnosis. No relationship was found between the participants' demography and category of appraisal. Some differences in the patterns of constructs characterized the subjects within the three appraisal categories.    Three conclusions were drawn: (a) the women generally used some similar typologies of events in construing the meanings of their disease; (b) the women preferred "Challenge" among the three categories of appraisal of cancer; and (c) there were some distinctive features in the patterns of personal cognitive constructs of women who appraised their breast cancer as Harm/Loss, Threat, or Challenge.    This study used a convenience sample of 62 Italian women, therefore the results are not generalizable beyond the participants. An insufficient number of subjects who had had surgery were accrued to the study to determine differences between those who had had surgery and those who had not. It is possible that women who participated had motives that were different than women who may have declined, and/or the physician had motives in approaching the participants. The majority of interviews were held in clinical settings exposed to environmental noise beyond the control of the interviewers. The translation from Italian to English may have caused modifications within the original meanings assigned by the participants. Lazarus's categories of appraisal may assume a different meaning when translated within Italian culture.    This study can be replicated on comparable samples of women across countries to evaluate the role of national cultures upon appraisal and constructs. Longitudinal research is needed to assess changes within constructs from diagnosis through to surgery, and finally, experimental research is needed to test the study's underlying assumption of a link between constructs and first appraisal of cancer and to evaluate the nursing interventions that could be used to help women with breast cancer.

T1  - Validation of the Repertory Grid for Use in Modeling Knowledge
AN  - 231382313; 00603508
AB  - The extrapolation of theories of cognitive modeling from the psychological contexts to the domain of information systems design has raised empirical questions regarding the validity and reliability of these techniques in the new applications environment.  Kelly's (1955) theory of personal construct psychology (PCP) is one such theory that, together with the repertory grid technique of cognitive modeling, is being explored for use in systems development.  Since the repertory grid constitutes a mechanism for both the elicitation and the representation of cognitive models, it has been suggested for incorporation into intelligent front-end interfaces for information storage and retrieval systems (ISRS).  Previous applications of the grid have emphasized the personal and ideographic characteristics of personal construct systems.  The repertory grid is tested for representing commonality of construing among members of a homogeneous group of subjects.  Some differences are noted between constructs generated by subjects and those provided for them by an expert.  Implications of this effect for the application of PCP to ISRS design are discussed.

T1  - A Repertory Grid Analysis of Austria's Image as a Summer Vacation Destination
AN  - 217447123; 00442413
AB  - The appropriateness of Kelly's (1955) repertory grid technique to destination image research is demonstrated.  Images held by UK vacationers of Austria as a summer destination were investigated.  A sample of 25 individuals matching middle-class and opinion-leadership characteristics were asked questions concerning recent vacations, future vacations, and countries to elicit names of countries.  Minimum context form (triadic method) was used to elicit constructs.  Respondents then located each country on a 5-point rating scale to match their image of the destination.  The respondents generated 296 constructs from 17 elements, and 3,062 ratings of 17 nations were obtained.  Content analysis reduced the constructs into 11 clusters.  In general, Austria was seen as an attractive destination for a summer vacation; 8 of the 25 participants rated it at the highest point.  The image data generated by the grid have the potential for more validity than those produced by structured questionnaires.

AB  - A common problem of all cognitive-behavioural models of destination choice is that of the identification of factors influencing the behaviour of interest. This paper considers the applicability of Kelly's repertory grid methodology to identify the factors influencing consumer choice of shopping centres. Firstly, some methodological issues in the assessment of the relative importance people attach to certain variables in deciding where to shop are discussed. Secondly, the main findings of an application of the repertory grid methodology are presented. The paper concludes by discussing some implications of the measurement of the determinants of choice behaviour and the construction of mathematical models of destination choice.

T1  - Allocation of Repertory Grid Constructs to Superordinate Categories: Interjudge Reliability
AN  - 1970427613
AB  - After using a form of the Repertory Grid technique to elicit from teachers constructs of the characteristics of children with behaviour problems, the authors and four other judges allocated the constructs to superordinate categories.Some research reports have indicated that the criterion for interjudge reliability has been product moment correlations of the number of constructs allocated to categories. It is possible that such a method may lead to misinterpretation.Interjudge reliabilities, expressed by product moment correlations, were high when number of constructs was considered. However, an investigation carried out to ascertain percentages of same constructs allocated to the categories revealed that relatively low percentages of constructs were so allocated.

T1  - The Repertory Grid in Action: How to Use It to Conduct an Attitude Survey
AN  - 214110878; 00109517
AB  - The Repertory Grid Technique (Repgrid) may be the best method of discovering people's attitudes or beliefs.  Using the Repgrid as the basis for conducting an attitude survey is the most ambitious of its uses.  While the Repgrid is a survey, it is not a questionnaire.  Managers responding to the survey rate their peers on a numerical basis, according to common traits in handling people.  Then, strong points and weaknesses are listed, along with traits that make some different from others.Analyzing the results is more difficult and is the most crucial phase in the entire exercise.  A 7-step procedure facilitates analysis: 1.  Number the forms.  2.  Score the forms.  3.  Extract top data.  4.  Extract tail data.  5.  Sort and categorize data.  6.  Compare top and tail data.  7.  Produce summary pen pictures.Feeding back the results of the survey in a face-to-face meeting with management is preferred to a written report.  Participants may receive a written summary.  Total time spent should take around 36 hours.

T1  - The Study of Personnel Management as an Occupation, Using Repertory Grid
AN  - 214814717; 00101081
AB  - Part of a research project which examined personnel management as an occupational specialism is described.  The main intention is to understand personnel managers' values and beliefs and the settings which give rise to them.  This objective can be approached through the occupational community or the organizational context of personnel work.   This research draws on Kelly's personal construct theory by examining the way 20 personnel specialists in 4 organizations interpret and make meaningful the roles of others encountered in their working world.  These constructs were discovered by using a repertory grid technique, and results from the 4 organizations are compared.  Possible explanations are suggested of the ways in which the personnel specialists studied coped with values that conflict with their own and of how they are able to integrate within their organization's culture.  Results suggest that the way managers are subjected to competing pressures produces an adaptive response.
