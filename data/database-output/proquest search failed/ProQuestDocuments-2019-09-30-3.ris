T1  - Personal Constructs of Mind-Body Identity in People Who Experience Medically Unexplained Symptoms
AN  - 2280236240
AB  - "Medically unexplained symptoms" (MUS) refers to chronic physical symptoms without a clear medical cause, which produce significant levels of distress and functional impairment. This project modified the repertory grid technique to explore how twenty participants experiencing MUS construed self and others in bodily and psychological ways. Findings suggested that symptoms are well integrated within participants' wider mind-body construct systems. Increased distance between how self in general is construed compared to self when symptoms are worst was associated with reduced anxiety. Measuring intrapersonal and interpersonal implicative dilemmas suggested that moral and relational construing of identity is affected by MUS.

T1  - Mapping Perceptions of Humanness in Speech-Based Intelligent Personal Assistant Interaction
AN  - 2266666129
AB  - Humanness is core to speech interface design. Yet little is known about how users conceptualise perceptions of humanness and how people define their interaction with speech interfaces through this. To map these perceptions n=21 participants held dialogues with a human and two speech interface based intelligent personal assistants, and then reflected and compared their experiences using the repertory grid technique. Analysis of the constructs show that perceptions of humanness are multidimensional, focusing on eight key themes: partner knowledge set, interpersonal connection, linguistic content, partner performance and capabilities, conversational interaction, partner identity and role, vocal qualities and behavioral affordances. Through these themes, it is clear that users define the capabilities of speech interfaces differently to humans, seeing them as more formal, fact based, impersonal and less authentic. Based on the findings, we discuss how the themes help to scaffold, categorise and target research and design efforts, considering the appropriateness of emulating humanness.

T1  - A Study of Young Gifted Learners’ and Their Teachers’ Perceptions of Effective EFL Learners<sup>*</sup>
AN  - 2176101650
AB  - This study compared gifted learners’ and their English teachers’ perceptions of who is an effective English as a foreign language (EFL) learner. The research questions include the following: (a) What are young gifted learners’ perceptions of an effective EFL learner? (b) What are English teachers’ perceptions of an effective EFL learner? and (c) Is there a match between young gifted learners’ and their English teachers’ perceptions of an effective EFL learner? The participants were two gifted learners attending the English classes at the Science and Arts Center (BILSEM) in Adana, Turkey, and two English teachers working with these students. Data were collected through repertory grids, written accounts of the students, and retrospective interviews. Findings include implications for designing appropriate instruction for gifted EFL learners and teacher educators who work with these specific learners.

T1  - Developing an integrated quality network for lean operations systems
AN  - 2117742150
AB  - PurposeMost successful companies have adopted some type of improvement methodology to achieve optimum performance, high quality, lower costs and productivity. Some of the structured methodologies employed indiscriminately are total quality management, quality control, agile, lean and Six Sigma which yield varied results. The purpose of this paper is to explore how to harness the power of an integrated system of quality tools and techniques to create operational excellence. An integrated framework involves matching quality tools and techniques to the multi-phases (input, transformation and output) of lean manufacturing or service ecosystem.Design/methodology/approachCurrent research of lean quality systems provides a conceptual understanding of core tools employed by manufacturing and service organizations. Interviewing domain experts from a series of manufacturing and service organizations highlighted a common challenge. The challenge was lean tools and methodologies were selected and employed arbitrarily for the different operational phases, which resulted in selective synergies of tools between operational phases. This limitation resulted in rework and duplication of quality efforts through the diverse phases of the transformation system. This study is based on the hypothesis that all phases of an operational system must be linked by common tools and methodologies which enables harnessing quality benefits and synergies throughout the entire operational system. The study methodology trailed through cooperative inquiry using a case study approach to design an integrated framework of tools that facilitates a common platform for manufacturing or service ecosystems.FindingsThis study suggests that quality systems in a complex competitive environment must consider an integrated iterative approach. An iterative development of lean quality tools for multiple phases produces an integrated quality system. Such systems employ blending and extending of lean quality tools to multiple phases of the transformation system to synthesize agile and versatile quality system.Research limitations/implicationsA limitation of this study is that the research of integrated framework is based on repertory grid technique only; it should be supplemented by other methods. Second, the proposed framework does not consider the complexity added by the internal and external stakeholders as they interface with the integrated system at different points with reference to phases of the system.Practical implicationsOne of the advantages of this method is its generality, instead of delivering a monolithic system at the culmination of long transformation process we rely on smaller quality sprints which are implemented sequentially at each stage or phase of the transformation system. The phenomena of incremental clustering of time-series of quality sprints for different phases results in true integration from end to end for a transformation system.Social implicationsThis study helps investigate the personal constructs that users and managers employ to interpret and select quality tools or methodologies for the different phases of lean transformational system.Originality/valueThis study aims to understand the impact of blending quality and business process improvement tools and methodologies to enhance outcomes. The basis of this study is “the power of multiplicity” through which a diverse collection of improvement paths is pooled into an integrated framework of quality tools for lean and efficient operations.

T1  - High-impact information types on market value: property appraisers' information sources and assessment confidence
AN  - 2037004810
AB  - This explanatory paper describes and analyses which types of information professional property appraisers perceive to have the most impact on a commercial property's estimated market value, which information sources they primarily use, and how reliable they perceive the information sources to be. The paper also investigates whether appraisers' perceptions differ depending on the location of the business. A sample of 67 authorised property appraisers in Sweden was surveyed using the repertory grid technique as a questionnaire tool (to investigate unconscious behaviour), and non-parametric statistics. Analyses of the data show that four types of information have the greatest impact on estimated market value: the local environment and location are perceived as reliable, and property appraisers have confidence in those assessments; rental income seems problematic, because the property owner is the major source of information; and property appraisers are not confident in assessments based on discount rates. This pattern holds for various geographical locations.

T1  - A qualitative research on travellers' destination choice behaviour
AN  - 1935884141
AB  - The repertory grid technique was used in this paper to investigate the decision-making process of travellers. Results showed that both destination physical attributes and the travellers' feelings towards the destination play a significant role in the choice of holiday destinations. Notably, a distinct choice pattern emerged from the analysis, which showed some travellers begin their planning process not based on the destination features but on the availability of air tickets on sale. This observation suggested the potential influence of the "sequence" of receiving or searching for transport and tourism information on the choice of a holiday destination.

T1  - A Personal Construct Psychology Based Investigation Into A Product Service System For Renting Pushchairs To Consumers
AN  - 1917802679
AB  - This paper explores how consumers construe a product service system (PSS) for the supply of pushchairs. A PSS is a system of products, services, networks of actors and supporting infrastructure designed to be more sustainable than traditional business models. PSSs face an implementation challenge in consumer markets, and this case based research explores some reasons for this. The study applies personal construct psychology (in particular, the repertory grid technique), which has not previously been used in relation to researching PSSs. 
Results suggest that a PSS might be difficult to implement in relation to pushchairs. Renting pre-used equipment may meet resistance because of a perceived risk that acquisition by this means might endanger infants. Participants in the study construed buying new products from specialist infant product shops as being the best way of acquiring them. Accordingly, PSS providers may, for instance, have to implement certified quality assurance processes in order to reassure consumers. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

T1  - An experimental investigation of knowledge acquisition techniques
AN  - 1896807344
AB  - Purpose 
Knowledge is a key driver for the competitive success of organizations, but about 90 percent of organizational knowledge is inside employees' minds with personal essence; therefore, this paper provides valuable vision for managers by exploring knowledge acquisition (KA) techniques and personality type. The purpose of this paper is to examine KA techniques and explore the impact of personality type on the KA process in the aerospace industry. 
Design/methodology/approach 
This paper examines KA techniques through an empirical study involving 83 participants to take part in KA sessions. For exploring techniques, a questionnaire was used, and also the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was used to identify participants' personality type. The impact of personality type on KA processes was determined by correlation analysis. 
Findings 
Analyses confirmed some association between the type of personality and KA process. In addition, the findings of exploring questionnaire items showed that participants gave the laddering technique the highest rating. 
Originality/value 
The paper may be of high value to researchers in the field of KA, especially in aerospace industries, because there is very little experimental investigation of KA, and it also provides valuable information and guidelines that hopefully will help researchers to select appropriate KA techniques.

T1  - A Decision Support Method for Recommending Degrees of Exploration in Exploratory Testing
AN  - 2074532965
AB  - Exploratory testing is neither black nor white, but rather a continuum of exploration exists. In this research we propose an approach for decision support helping practitioners to distribute time between different degrees of exploratory testing on that continuum. To make the continuum manageable, five levels have been defined: freestyle testing, high, medium and low degrees of exploration, and scripted testing. The decision support approach is based on the repertory grid technique. The approach has been used in one company. The method for data collection was focus groups. The results showed that the proposed approach aids practitioners in the reflection of what exploratory testing levels to use, and aligns their understanding for priorities of decision criteria and the performance of exploratory testing levels in their contexts. The findings also showed that the participating company, which is currently conducting mostly scripted testing, should spend more time on testing using higher degrees of exploration in comparison to scripted testing.

T1  - Exploring political risk in offshoring engagements
AN  - 1883514600
AB  - This research focuses on the analysis of political risk in the context of offshoring decisions. The study uses the Repertory Grid Technique, which entails a series of semi-structured interviews exploring key political risk experiences across offshoring engagements. The research extends the spectrum of political risk analysis in the context of offshoring engagements, and explores the varied impact of political risk across business activity types. The research identifies five key political risks affecting offshoring engagements and highlights the moderating effect of specific offshoring activity types Business Process Outsourcing, Information Technology Outsourcing or Knowledge Process Outsourcing on political risk implications. The research explores the conditioning effect of activity specific exposure to political risk and enhances the explanatory ability of the Transaction Cost Economics constructs, offering a novel operationalisation of the political risk component of external uncertainty. From a practical perspective, the research highlights the need for developing managerial tools to improve monitoring and identification of risks. The key practical contribution is the development of differentiated political risk typologies that can capture the nuances of external risks in offshoring, allowing for more accurate risk assessment of offshoring decisions.

T1  - Assessing Intangibles in Lean Start-Ups Using Repertory Grids
AN  - 1970714924
AB  - Conference Title: 2017 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET)
Conference Start Date: 2017, July 9
Conference End Date: 2017, July 13
Conference Location: Portland, OR, USA
The assessment of intangibles in business plans by investors is an important factor of recent interest, particularly in the evaluation of early-stage technology-based ventures. On one hand, investors are challenged to properly assess new opportunities. At the same time, entrepreneurs or innovators face the formidable task of communicating what is, sometimes, nothing more than just an 'extraordinary' idea. In such situations, the decision to continue with the due diligence process, and finally to invest, is based frequently on those aspects that are intangible. In an attempt to reveal some of the intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs, an investigation was conducted using repertory grid, a technique based on personal construct psychology. Five venture capitalists and five entrepreneurs were interviewed. Evidence was found for the importance of intangibles during the investment-decision process of early stage technology-based ventures. For these ventures, the consideration of only tangible criteria is not a guaranteed predictor of success. The repertory grid technique makes a significant contribution to the identification of intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs.

T1  - Personal Constructions of Biological Concepts - The Repertory Grid Approach
AN  - 1882018017
AB  - The identification of a natural kind by science is a claim to have established how nature is divided at one of its many 'joints'.  [...]physics claims that the electromagnetic field is a natural kind, chemistry claims that the stuff labelled 'water' is just that material with composition H2O and is a natural kind.  The key problem is that the hidden essences of folk biology rarely, if ever, coincide with the natural kinds identified by the scientific discipline(s) of biology.  [...]as a biology teacher, one may be faced with the task of displacing or perhaps over-riding a student's strongly held belief.

T1  - Creating places through participatory design: psychological techniques to understand people's conceptions
AN  - 1838429856
AB  - Place making is fundamental in creating human settlements. It is now understood that wholesome places cannot be created by professionals without the active participation of people who should be able to transform them as their own. Approaches to place making such as the Pattern Language of Christopher Alexander and Supports of Nabeel Hamdi attempted to engage people in the process in a number of ways. Participatory techniques are central to these practices, but there remain a paucity of appropriate techniques that can be adopted in facilitating people to articulate their perceptions useful to create places. This paper examines two psychological techniques; sorting task and location task and their applicability as practiced in a recent housing project implemented in Sri Lanka. The tasks divulged a number of facets of people's conceptualizations of their settlements; those related to the present setting, the specific places in the existing settlement, those related to the imagined places and finally the desired geographical features of the imagined places. The paper then interprets and discusses how these conceptualizations have been directed towards articulating the spaces in the designed setting so that they could be transformed by the people to become wholesome places. It demonstrates that when the idea of 'place' is the focus of participatory practices and by using the techniques described, meaningful places can be effectively created.

T1  - A DILEMMA‐FOCUSED INTERVENTION FOR DEPRESSION: A MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A 3‐MONTH FOLLOW‐UP
AN  - 2133357850
AB  - BackgroundSince long ago it has been asserted that internal conflicts are relevant to the understanding and treatment of mental disorders, but little research has been conducted to support the claim. The aim of this study was to test the differential efficacy of group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus an intervention focused on the dilemma(s) detected for each patient versus group individual CBT plus individual CBT for treating depression. A comparative controlled trial with a 3‐month follow‐up was conducted.MethodsOne hundred twenty‐eight adults meeting criteria for MDD and/or dysthymia, presenting at least one cognitive conflict (implicative dilemma or dilemmatic construct, assessed by the repertory grid technique) and who had completed seven sessions of group CBT were randomly assigned to eight sessions of individual manualized CBT or dilemma‐focused therapy (DFT). The Beck Depression Inventory‐II was administered at baseline, at the end of therapy and after 3 months’ follow‐up.ResultsMultilevel mixed effects modeling yielded no significant differences between CBT and DFT with the intention‐to‐treat sample. Equivalent effect sizes, remission, and response rates were found with completers as well. In combination with group CBT, both individual CBT and DFT significantly reduced depressive symptoms.ConclusionsBoth conditions obtained comparable results to those in the literature. Thus, the superiority of the adjunctive DFT was not demonstrated. Working with dilemmas can be seen as a promising additional target in the psychotherapy of depression, but further research is still required.

T1  - Using repertory grid techniques to measure change following dialectical behaviour therapy with adults with learning disabilities: two case studies
AN  - 1806429476
AB  - Accessible summary

              
Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be adapted for individuals with learning disabilities. DBT aims to teach people how to control their feelings, communicate with other people, manage distress and be more self-aware.

              
This article presents the case studies of two adults with learning disabilities who completed DBT and shows how their opinions of themselves and others changed.

              
The results discussed include overall change in construing, changes in self-esteem and changes in dilemmas they had about themselves before DBT.

              
Background: Government strategy indicates that individuals with learning disabilities should have access to adapted psychological therapies. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is recommended for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, there is little published research regarding whether it can be appropriately adapted for adults with learning disabilities. The research available primarily focuses on measures of behavioural and psychiatric change, with little emphasis on the psychological changes that occur.

              
Materials and Methods: Two case studies are presented that using repertory grid technique, based on personal construct psychology (PCP). Both individuals completed repertory grids prior to, and following, adapted DBT for adults with learning disabilities within a specialist community psychology service in the United Kingdom.

              
Results: The case studies show some of the psychological changes that have occurred within adults with learning disabilities who received adapted DBT within a community psychology service. Changes included altered self-esteem and dilemmas individuals have about themselves.

              
Conclusion: The contrasting case studies demonstrate the complexity and idiosyncrasy of the experiences of individuals with learning disabilities who receive DBT, and discuss how this information can be integrated into clinical practice.

T1  - How Does Education from a High-Status University Affect Professional Property Appraisers' Valuation Judgments?
AN  - 1873989523
AB  - The repertory grid technique is used to investigate professional property appraisers' thought patterns, and these patterns' complexity, with respect to the universities from which the appraisers graduated. Nearly half of Sweden's 138 authorized property appraisers participated in the study. The results indicate that the appraisers graduating from the university with the longest tradition of property education and ranked highest among the universities offering such education in Sweden have less complex thought patterns than do those graduating from other Swedish universities. This indicates that appraisers graduating from the highest ranked university simplify their valuation judgments more than do other appraisers.

T1  - Mixed or merged? Integration as the real challenge for mixed methods
AN  - 1826809850
AB  - Purpose

              
Giampietro Gobo called for new methods that combine qualitative and quantitative approaches in a single instrument, suggesting this was the next challenge facing social research and mixed methods in particular. The purpose of this paper is to respond to that challenge.

              
Design/methodology/approach

              
An overview of methods, demonstrating their inherently mixed qualities, with special emphasis on a range of methods that can be classified as merged.

              
Findings

              
The real challenge is not to find merged methods, but to ensure integration of the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the methods used during the analysis and writing processes.

              
Practical implications

              
Researchers need to be alerted to the mixed elements within their work, to learn how to better tap into these and to exploit the integrative potential of their methods during analysis and writing. Researchers need more "rounded" methods training.

              
Originality/value

              
This paper refocuses the challenge facing mixed methods research.

T1  - How Business Customers Judge Solutions: Solution Quality and Value in Use
AN  - 1799224311
AB  - Many manufacturers look to business solutions to provide growth; however, success is far from guaranteed, and it is unclear how such solutions can create superior perceived value. This article explores what constitutes value for customers from solutions over time -- conceptualized as "value in use" -- and how this arises from quality perceptions of the solution's components. The authors develop a framework for solution quality and value in use through 36 interviews combining repertory grid technique and means-end chains. The findings significantly extend the extant view of quality as a function of the supplier's products and services, and show that customers also assess the quality of their own resources and processes, as well as the quality of the joint resource integration process. The authors report that value in use corresponds not just to collective, organizational goals but also to individuals' goals, a finding that strongly contrasts with prior research. Four moderators of the quality-value relationship demonstrate customer heterogeneity across both firms and roles within what the authors term the "usage center." When shifting toward solutions, manufacturers require very different approaches to market research; account management; solution design; and quality control, including the need for value-auditing processes.

T1  - Dilemma-focused intervention for unipolar depression: a treatment manual
AN  - 1850505456
AB  - Background

              
This article introduces a new treatment protocol for depression. Based on previous research which indicated the presence of cognitive conflicts in depression, this study created an intervention manual to address these conflicts.

              
Method

              
The therapy manual for depressive patients followed the guideline for inclusion in clinical trials (stage II), which has received high recognition. A preliminary version (stage I) of this manual was formulated based on other, more general dilemma-focused therapy publications, inspired by personal construct theory (PCT), and input from clinical experience. The resulting version was then applied during the 8-session format of a pilot study with patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder or dysthymia. Finally, feedback was requested from seasoned and highly respected therapists, some of whom were familiar with PCT.

              
Results

              
According to the mentioned guideline, the intervention manual selected the theoretical framework, in this case PCT, to include its conceptualization of depression and resolution of dilemmas (to foster clinical improvement) as a main treatment goal. The manual was then contrasted with psychoanalytic psychotherapy, cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI), and other similar approaches such as cognitive-analytic therapy and coherence therapy. Following these conceptual clarifications, the specific interventions included in the manual were defined according to both categories: their unique and essential components and those conceived as common psychotherapeutic factors. Next, the general structure and content for each session were presented. The structure consisted of seven well-defined individual sessions with an additional session, which could complement any of the former sessions to address the patient's issues in greater depth, if needed.

              
Conclusions

              
This Dilemma-Focused Intervention manual aimed to improve the treatment outcome for depression by offering an intervention that could be combined with other general approaches. At its present level of definition, it allows for inclusion in controlled trials (eg, the current RCT combining group CBT with this intervention). Thus, this manual added to the existing resources in psychotherapeutic research and practice for treatment of depression.

The key factor for new products or services' success is to meet the needs of user, while it is difficult to identify potential needs since users have difficulty in expressing them or do not realize them at all. Previous researches have suggested that designers often could not predict users' views of the product and their preferences accurately. In this study, we explore the discrepancies, if any, between designers' and users' perception toward a set of application products in its concept design stage. We apply the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT), and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) to quantify rich qualitative insights. One can minimize the gap between designers' and users' perceptions in end products by this way.

T1  - Cognition, Behavior, and Team Structure in Enterprise Systems Implementation: A Comparative Study
AN  - 1755482375
AB  - The METRICS framework was developed during a landmark enterprise-wide system implementation in a Brazilian university. It was designed as a tool for managing the social subsystem (cognition, behavior, and structure) of customer teams as they work with external technology and business teams. Our research draws on METRICS to verify the stability of cognitive, behavioral, and structural attributes that are expected to impact the performance of customer teams in projects. We compare two studies developed in different periods, with different methods, theories, projects, and types of teams, and in different geographical, cultural, and economic regions of Brazil -- the south and the northeast. Data collection and analysis were based on personal constructs theory and the repertory grid technique applied to select information technology professionals from external teams (that worked with customer teams) in the northeast. With 77.3% (68/88) of the original measures verified empirically, the framework was considered stable across multiple settings. Given that enterprise-wide system implementation usually involves global technology vendors, and since Brazil is an illustrative case of Latin America and the developing world, our research contributes with insights into the social aspects of customer teams that impact project performance.

T1  - What Are the Characteristics That Software Development Project Team Members Associate With a Good Project Manager?
AN  - 1714533226
AB  - In this study we investigate what software development project team members consider to be a good project manager. Previous research has been carried out using project manager self-assessments, other project stakeholder views, or recruiters' views. This qualitative study used the repertory grid technique to identify the characteristics that project team members associate with a good project manager. This technique has been adopted because of its strength in eliciting personal constructs. Among the 18 characteristics identified, the seven most relevant were classified and compared with previous findings, which reveals differences between the team members' and project managers' and other stakeholders' perceptions. Those findings complement the existing skill set and could be considered when recruiting and training project managers and staffing projects.

T1  - Customer usage processes: A conceptualization and differentiation
AN  - 1708001165
AB  - For more than a decade, marketing scholars in the field of service-dominant logic have discussed the ideas of customer value and value creation. An important element in customer value creation is the resources customers use in usage processes. A thorough investigation of these processes, however, is absent in the literature. The purposes of this article are to (1) provide a conceptual understanding of customer usage processes and (2) identify the dimensions for differentiating these processes. Building on an extensive literature review, we derive a conceptualization of customer usage processes and identify three dimensions to differentiate these processes, namely, actor intensity, interaction intensity, and resource intensity. We specify these dimensions further by using the repertory grid technique. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the nature of customer usage processes, the possibilities for differentiating them, and their relationship to the value creation process.

T1  - Leadership skills as construed by nonprofit chief executives
AN  - 1695754656
AB  - Purpose              - The purpose of this paper is to explore how chief executives of 20 nonprofit organizations construe and prioritize the skills they use to perform typical leadership tasks.              Design/methodology/approach              - The in-depth interview protocol used in the study is based on the Repertory Grid Technique, which elicits assumptions, beliefs, and values of respondents without imposing the researchers' implicit frame of reference.              Findings              - The interviews generated 285 skill constructs. Respondents in this study report that they utilize a mix of technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills. Interpersonal skills, especially communication and trust building, appear to be particularly prevalent among the many skills used by executives to perform their leadership tasks.              Research limitations/implications              - Because this is an exploratory study, its findings cannot yet be generalized to other contexts. Therefore, the paper concludes with some propositions for further research.              Practical implications              - The study may have implications for the design of curricula to prepare people to assume leadership positions in nonprofit organizations.              Originality/value              - This study uses a distinctive methodology to elicit from nonprofit leaders their assumptions and beliefs about the skills they use to perform leadership tasks. In this respect, the findings are grounded in the frames of reference of the subjects, not those of the researchers.

The aim of this study is to investigate visualization concepts by eliciting users' experience when using university campus maps. A pragmatic paradigm was applied to elicit subjective view of users' perception and aggregate their personal constructs in a more general, objective context. The methodological approach taken in this study was a mixed-method approach, in the form of repertory grid technique to elicit a list of factors when using a campus map. Thirteen usefulness factors of visualization were derived using thematic analysis. A triangulation between these factors and Principal Component Analysis results was conducted to provide more holistic classifications. This study offers important insights by adopting an uncommon paradigm in generating valuable data concerning the perceived characteristics of visualization based on users' perception.

T1  - The Couple's Grid: A Tool for Assessing Interpersonal Construction in Couples
AN  - 1627735864
AB  - In the study of human relationships, interest in interpersonal construction is increasing because of its implications for the quality of the couple's relationship. The processes involved in construing self and others may play a key role. However, a precise methodology to study those processes has not yet been developed. The aim of this article is to present a dyadic assessment tool, the couple's grid (CG), which is inspired from constructivist and systemic perspectives. Derived from Procter's (1985) family grid, the CG is similarly based on the repertory grid technique. The CG assesses perception of self and partner, and their ideals, and also the metaperception of the partner's view (e.g., "What does your partner think about you?"). These two levels of analysis provide measures of perceived similarity, commonality, and sociality. This article describes the development of CG as an assessment tool with a case illustration.

T1  - Heart Diseases and Conditions; New Findings from Queensland University of Technology Update Understanding of Myocardial Infarction (Impact of community pharmacist intervention discussing patients' beliefs to improve medication adherence)
AN  - 1625993334
AB  - Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the Queensland University of Technology, "To investigate if community pharmacists discussing patients' beliefs about their medicines improved medication adherence at 12 months post myocardial infarction. This study included 200 patients discharged from a public teaching hospital in Queensland, Australia, following a myocardial infarction. Patients were randomised into intervention (n = 100) and control groups (n = 100) and followed for 12 months. All patients were interviewed between 5 to 6 weeks, at 6 and 12 months post discharge by the researcher using the repertory grid technique. This technique was used to elicit the patient's individualised beliefs about their medicines for their myocardial infarction. In the intervention group, patients' beliefs about their medicines were communicated by the researcher to their community pharmacist. The pharmacist used this information to tailor their discussion with the patient about their medication beliefs at designated time points (3 and 6 months post discharge). The control group was provided with usual care.

T1  - Heart Diseases and Conditions; New Findings from Queensland University of Technology Update Understanding of Myocardial Infarction (Impact of community pharmacist intervention discussing patients' beliefs to improve medication adherence)
AN  - 1626028811
AB  - Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the Queensland University of Technology, "To investigate if community pharmacists discussing patients' beliefs about their medicines improved medication adherence at 12 months post myocardial infarction. This study included 200 patients discharged from a public teaching hospital in Queensland, Australia, following a myocardial infarction. Patients were randomised into intervention (n = 100) and control groups (n = 100) and followed for 12 months. All patients were interviewed between 5 to 6 weeks, at 6 and 12 months post discharge by the researcher using the repertory grid technique. This technique was used to elicit the patient's individualised beliefs about their medicines for their myocardial infarction. In the intervention group, patients' beliefs about their medicines were communicated by the researcher to their community pharmacist. The pharmacist used this information to tailor their discussion with the patient about their medication beliefs at designated time points (3 and 6 months post discharge). The control group was provided with usual care.

T1  - The strategic role of the sales force: perceptions of senior sales executives
AN  - 1552797963
AB  - Current models of sales force strategy imply formidable information processing demands, which leads us to take a cognitive approach to studying the issue of sales force strategy. We focus on how top-level executives use mental models of sales force performance to simplify the issue of sales force strategy. We interviewed 74 senior executives responsible for their firms' selling function using the repertory grid approach, as this methodology has been shown to be particularly effective at uncovering the collective cognitive maps on which executives' decisions and behaviors are based. Executives identified a broad set of 37 strategic concepts that they felt distinguish the sales force efforts of directly competing companies. A second set of sales executives classified the 37 concepts into capabilities, resources, and organizational context concepts. Based on the classification results and feedback from both sets of executives, we developed research propositions for examining sales force strategy and provide directions for future research.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Lobbying the 'Energiewende'. Assessing the effectiveness of strategies to promote the renewable energy business in Germany
AN  - 1520422251
AB  - The article examines the influence of renewable energy companies on the decision-making process related to the German energy transition. It identifies clusters of different lobbying activities and styles through in depth interviews with 20 stakeholders from policy-making and business. The research used Repertory Grid Technique in combination with HOMALS multivariate analysis. Its main findings are: First, although the big four electric utilities operating on the German energy market still possess wide influence, companies of renewable energy have developed from a niche into important players of the energy regime. Second, lobbies by the renewable energy sector are mainly aimed at the legislative framework, particularly on the Renewable Energy Sources Act and the feed-in-system. Third, interviewees identified 36 different lobby activities; the most effective ones are: 'Regular and personal maintenance of contact to politicians', 'Lobbying within an association', 'Knowledge development with correct information' and 'Top-down contacting of most powerful politicians'. Fourth, the statistical analysis reveals clear distinctions between companies with regards to their lobby strategies which are evaluated differently by stakeholders. Finally, the article concludes that companies have a strong influence on political-decision making and -- together with governmental actors -- form a 'policy network' that strongly shapes the German energy transition.

T1  - Female and male risk aversion: An empirical study of loan officers' assessment of SME loan applications
AN  - 1536541757
AB  - Purpose - The aim of the paper is to analyse female and male loan officers' (LOs) risk aversion as they assess different types of small- and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) loan applications. Design/methodology/approach - The data were gathered from a sample of 75 Swedish LOs, using the repertory grid technique and related questions. The data were analysed statistically. Findings - The findings demonstrate that female LOs focus more on collateral (used as a proxy for risk aversion) in their evaluations of first-time loan applications than male LOs. However, the findings also suggest that there are no significant differences between the two groups as far as risk aversion when they evaluate additional loan applications. The other variables controlled for (age, tenure, insight, education, and location) did not significantly affect the LOs' risk aversion. Research limitations/implications - The study might have benefited from the use of complementary data collection approaches. Access to actual assessment and decision-making procedures could have increased the understanding of female and male LOs' attitudes toward risk. Practical implications - The findings suggest that by the use of female-male LO teams, banks may achieve more balanced assessments of SMEs' loan applications. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, the literature has not explicitly addressed risk aversion among female and male LOs with respect to different types of bank loans. Moreover, the authors investigated risk aversion in the context of standardised assessments procedures used to reduce exposure to credit risk.

T1  - The Semantics of Freedom in Agoraphobic Patients: An Empirical Study
AN  - 1500708005
AB  - This study aimed to empirically test the clinical theory, common to constructivist and constructionist psychotherapeutic approaches, that the semantics of freedom (i.e., bipolar constructs regarding the dimension of meaning "free/constrained") are psychologically linked to agoraphobia. Repertory grid technique was used to elicit constructs from 30 agoraphobic patients and from a matched control group of patients suffering from other psychological disorders, and the two sets of constructs were compared in terms of their semantic content. Results confirm the hypothesis, suggesting that freedom semantics seem to be prevalent in agoraphobia in terms of both frequency and importance. These results and their limitations are discussed in relation to their clinical applications and in light of the methodological issues arising from the study. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Characteristics of the Construct Systems of Women Victims of Intimate Partner Violence
AN  - 1500707856
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the structural characteristics of the construct systems of women who had suffered intimate partner violence (IPV). We compared a group of 40 women victims of IPV and 40 controls using the symptom check list (SCL-90-R) and the repertory grid technique (RGT). IPV victims showed more psychological symptoms, higher polarization and unidimensional thinking, and more implicative dilemmas than the comparison group. In contrast to previous assumptions and findings about their low self-esteem, no significant differences were found with the control group in the actual self-ideal self discrepancy measure of the RGT. These cognitive characteristics of the construct system should be taken into account in efforts to assist IPV victims psychologically. For example, if results were confirmed by further studies, interventions should give priority to dilemma resolution over self-esteem enhancement as a focus of therapy. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluating the User experience of Tangible Interface Prototypes
AN  - 1952245947
AB  - In order to choose the right method to evaluate the user experience (UX) of products, several UX dimensions need to be taken into account. The choice of a method for evaluating these dimensions also depends on other factors such as development phase, time constraints or available expertise. We present an adapted method for qualitatively evaluating tangible user interface (TUI) prototypes based on three existing methods (the explicitation interview, Open Profiling of Quality and the Repertory Grid Technique) , which can be used for evaluating physical characteristics of TUIs. Two case studies are presented which will be used to further refine and validate the adapted method.

T1  - Investigating Readers' Impressions of Typographic Differentiation Using Repertory Grids
AN  - 1509047246
AB  - Document designers combine a range of stylistic and structural typographic attributes to articulate and differentiate information for readers. This paper explores how the kind of typographic differentiation used in a document influences readers' impressions of documents. A preliminary study indicated that three patterns of typographic differentiation might underlie participants' impressions of magazine design. Subsequently, a set of nine magazine layouts with controlled content was purposefully developed to systematically examine the impact of high, moderate and low patterns of typographic differentiation on participants' impressions of documents. These documents were used in a repertory grid procedure to investigate the kinds of impressions readers articulate in relation to typographic presentation and whether readers are likely to formulate similar or differing impressions from high, moderate, and low patterns of typographic differentiation. The results suggest that typographic differentiation influences a range of rhetorical and experiential judgments.

T1  - The Semantics of Power Among People With Eating Disorders
AN  - 1151997498
AB  - The study aimed to empirically test the hypothesis, developed within the systemic-constructionist theory of family semantic polarities, that the semantics of power are particularly meaningful for people with eating disorders. The repertory grid technique was used to elicit constructs from 30 young patients (10 anorexic, 10 bulimic, and 10 obese) and from a matched control group; the two sets of constructs were compared in terms of their semantic content. Overall the results confirmed the hypothesis, although further investigation into the semantic peculiarities of individual eating disorders is required. Methodological limitations and possible clinical applications are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The practical utility of using repertory grids with sexual offenders maintaining their innocence: a case study
AN  - 1154461157
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper is to highlight the practical utility of using repertory grids with sexual offenders in denial and to demonstrate through a case study how they can be used to bolster both initial assessment and psychological formulation. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a single case study design and applies a repertory grid methodology, which is underpinned by personal construct psychology, to make sense of the case study. The analysis predominately focuses on the structure of the repertory grid. Findings - The case study appeared to elicit factors that were of clinical utility and which could be used as tentative hypotheses for problem formulation and also seemed to point to an adequate starting point for intervention. Research limitations/implications - The use of the case study makes generalisation difficult and future research may benefit from more large-scale research. Practical implications - Rather than subscribing to fatalist notions of deniers as untreatable, the paper argues that constructive work can be done with this population and that repertory grids can be one way to initially facilitate this process. Originality/value - Currently "total deniers" are excluded from treatment and are seen as untreatable. It is argued here that this need not be the case and it is demonstrated how repertory grids can inform initial formulation with such offenders. Repertory grids have not been used with deniers before and this is an original feature of this research.

T1  - Comparación de efectividad de las técnicas de educción de requisitos software: visión novel y experta/Comparison on effectiveness of the software requirements elicitation techniques: novice and expert vision
AN  - 1321927293
AB  - Requirements engineering can use a lot of techniques to gather the users' needs. However, currently there are few practical guidelines and criteria for selecting techniques in a software development project. This paper tries to know the vision that novice requirements engineers have about the effectiveness of requirements elicitation techniques and compare it with the requirements experts' vision. To carry out the comparison, repertory grid technique was used. This technique allows knowing indirectly the subject's opinion on the techniques. The results show a substantial difference between both visions with regard to the techniques and elicitation context. This implies that a more extensive training, and primarily practice, is necessary in order for novice engineers to recognize differences in techniques effectiveness and decide with greater certainty about the most appropriate techniques to use in requirements elicitation sessions.

T1  - Perceptions of Industrial Design: The "Means" and the "Ends"
AN  - 1032776352
AB  - It is widely accepted that industrial design can play an important role in the development of innovative products, but integrating design-thinking into new product development (NPD) is a challenge. This is because industrial designers have very different perspectives and goals than the other members of the NPD team, and this can lead to tensions. It has been postulated that the communications between NPD managers and industrial designers are made more difficult because each group uses very different language. This research made the first empirical investigation of the language used by designers and managers in describing "good" and "poor" industrial design. In-depth interviews were conducted with a sample of 19 managers and industrial designers at five leading companies. Multiple sources of data were utilized, including the repertory grid technique to elicit the key attributes of design, from the perspective of managers and designers.

T1  - Mental Health; Research from Royal Manchester Children's Hospital Provide New Insights into Mental Health
AN  - 1017815186
AB  - Our news editors obtained a quote from the research by the authors from Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, "Ten psychiatric nursing staff working in a specialist mother and baby unit in the North of England were interviewed about their views of various types of client by using the repertory grid technique. A total of 86 constructs that clustered under 21 headings were elicited. All staff made critical judgements about some clients. Staff often described the context in which these perceptions were reached such as the behaviour of clients and the quality of the nurse-client relationship. Clients with a personality disorder and those who were thought to be 'bad' mothers were construed as being furthest from the self and more negatively than clients with depression or psychosis. Further training is indicated for staff working with mothers displaying challenging interactional styles; however, training packages must consider the individuality of perception and experience present within staff groups.

T1  - Changes in the Construct Systems of First-Year University Students: Impact on Psychological Symptoms and Problem-Solving Skills
AN  - 1030253758
AB  - This article studies the levels of psychological symptoms, problem-solving skills and self-construction in 28 freshmen, as assessed at the beginning and end of their first year at university. The repertory grid technique was used to assess self-ideal discrepancy, cognitive differentiation, and existence of implicative dilemmas. Results showed an improvement in psychological symptoms and self-ideal discrepancy, an increase in differentiation, but no significant differences in problem-solving skills. One or more implicative dilemmas were found in over half of the sample at the initial assessment and only in one-third at the final one, although this difference was not significant. Psychological symptoms at the end of the first year were predicted only by the initial reported symptoms. However, problem-solving skills at the end were predicted by a model including both initial skills and implicative dilemmas at the beginning of the year. Some implications for the adaptation of students during the first year at university are discussed.

T1  - Self-Construction, Cognitive Conflicts, and Disordered Eating Attitudes in Young Women
AN  - 1030251938
AB  - The aim of this study is to identify cognitive variables that predict disordered eating attitudes in a nonclinical sample composed of 50 female university students. Repertory grid technique was used to assess cognitive features of self-construing and cognitive conflicts. Drive for Thinness and Body Dissatisfaction scales from the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 were used as dependent variables, as previous studies suggested that high scores on these scales are associated with the risk of developing or aggravating eating syndromes. Results suggest that drive for thinness can be associated with cognitive conflicts, whereas body dissatisfaction may be higher for those who construct themselves as inadequate and similar to others. In addition, both dependent variables were predicted by being younger and having a higher body mass index.

T1  - Fibromyalgia; Research from University of Barcelona Reveals New Findings on Fibromyalgia
AN  - 863644943
AB  - Several authors have emphasized the need to explore issues related to self in these patients. The repertory grid technique (RGT), derived from personal construct theory, is a method designed to assess the patient's construction of self and others. A group of women with fibromyalgia (n= 30) and a control group (n= 30) were assessed using RGT. Women with fibromyalgia also completed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and a visual-analogue scale for pain, and painful tender points were explored. suggest that these women had a higher present self-ideal self discrepancy and a lower perceived adequacy of others, and it was more likely to find implicative dilemmas among them compared to controls.

T1  - Management Science; New Findings Reported from K. Goffin and Co-Authors Describe Advances in Management Science
AN  - 862871967
AB  - Post-project reviews (PPRs) are recognized as a highly effective mechanism for stimulating learning in NPD teams but, surprisingly, neither the typical ''lessons learnt'' that emerge from PPRs nor the role of tacit knowledge in NPD learning have previously been studied. To address this gap, five in-depth case studies were conducted at leading German companies. Three main sources of data were used: interviews with experienced NPD personnel using repertory grid technique, inspection of company process and project documentation, and observations of PPR discussions. Systematic coding of the qualitative data was conducted by two researchers working in parallel and verified through checks involving independent researchers. The coding process identified the lessons learnt and also the usage of metaphors and stories (which signifies tacit knowledge generation). The lessons that NPD personnel perceive to be the most important were identified from the repertory grid data. These included: knowing how to deal with project budgets, solving technical problems, meeting schedules, resource management, and managing organizational complexity.

T1  - Tacit Knowledge, Lessons Learnt, and New Product Development
AN  - 853750165
AB  - New product development (NPD) is a complex activity that is dependent on knowledge and learning. Post-project reviews (PPRs) are recognized as a highly effective mechanism for stimulating learning in NPD teams but, surprisingly, neither the typical "lessons learnt" that emerge from PPRs nor the role of tacit knowledge in NPD learning have previously been studied. To address this gap, five in-depth case studies were conducted at leading German companies. Three main sources of data were used: interviews with experienced NPD personnel using repertory grid technique, inspection of company process and project documentation, and observations of PPR discussions. Tacit knowledge is a popular management concept but one that is poorly understood, as empirical evidence to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical concepts is sadly lacking. This provides a unique opportunity for NPD scholars -- they have the ideal arena in which a deeper understanding of tacit knowledge can be generated.

T1  - Obituary: Fay Fransella: Pioneer of a radical people-centred theory of psychology
AN  - 854030352
AB  - Professor [Fay Adah Rachel Fransella], who has died aged 85, devoted most of her life to promoting a view of psychology centred on people. Personal construct psychology (PCP), a radical approach developed by an American, George Kelly, was for Fay something of an oasis in the "psychological desert" she found during her clinical training. The introductory book that she wrote on it with Don Bannister, Inquiring Man (1971), inspired a generation of psychologists, including me, who had become disillusioned by university courses dominated by behavioural approaches.              The book's message was that psychology could actually be about people, whose views, or constructions, of the world should be taken seriously, rather than about rats and pigeons. Not only that, but people could actively make choices about their worlds rather than being passive victims of their histories or biochemistry. Other highly influential books among Fay's more than 100 publications included A Manual for Repertory Grid Technique (1977), with Bannister and Richard Bell, detailing the approach's principal assessment method, and the International Handbook of Personal Construct Psychology (2003), which she edited.

T1  - Complexity Tools For Smart Grids: PCT And ABM Join Forces
AN  - 1349794950
AB  - This paper presents an innovative way of combining existing complexity tools to offer a better description of the diffusion of distributed electricity generation and Smart Grid. These complexity tools are Personal Construct Theory (PCT) and Agent Based Modeling (ABM). The primary value of ABM is that it permits multiple iterations of a model using slightly different input conditions (or variables), demonstrating how small changes can be amplified as the dynamics of the system evolve. The challenge for ABM is to accurately capture the behavior (or rules) of individuals (or agents). Agent rules and associated variables in existing models are determined using a wide variety of research methods which are not usually stated explicitly. The culminating rules are often mechanical, treating agents as automaton, and so do not reflect the complex emergence of new variables in the system being modelled. PCT, and its associated structured interview methodology called Repertory Grid Technique, elicits from respondents a set of constructs which reflects how individuals understand their behavior (towards electricity generation and consumption), consciously or otherwise. The constructs of multiple respondents provide a legitimate set of increasingly mature constructs which describe evolving rules for differentiated behavior in Smart Grid adoption. These agent rules, together with environmental information, such as the technological trajectories of products, political/regulatory incentives/taxes, economic wealth, population structure, climate information and housing stock, allow the ABM to be developed for a particular region or country. Running the ABM will show barriers to adoption and allow interventions to be tested in order to speed an emerging landscape of increased distributed energy generation and more use of renewables. Importantly, interventions will be linked to both sustained, behavioral change and contextual settings making for a more robust description of the diffusion of Smart Grid. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Thirty two women who met criteria for BN and were treated in a specialized center were compared to a non clinical group composed by 32 women matched by age. All participants were assessed using Repertory Grid Technique (RGT). In BN patients it was more common (71.9%) to find IDs than in controls (18.8%). They also showed higher polarization and higher self-ideal discrepancies (even more for those with a long history of BN). The measures provided by the RGT can be useful for the assessment of self-construction and cognitive conflicts in BN patients and to appreciate their role in this disorder," wrote G.

T1  - Management Psychology; New management psychology study findings recently were reported by researchers at University of Surrey
AN  - 577311977
AB  - Design/methodology/approach Using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique, ten managers reflected systematically on their feedback seeking in an organizational context. A grounded theory framework was used to identify higher-order cross-case constructs. Managers sought performance feedback when they perceived uncertainty and difficulty in the pursuit of their managerial functions and were minded of their need to develop their management skills. Consistent with the instrumental model, feedback seeking, was highly goal-oriented and self-affirmative in pursuit of increased managerial competence. However, the finding that adds most to the understanding on both an empirical and theoretical level is in showing how managers sought their feedback remotely, and from largely external sources, to reconcile development needs with self-protective considerations (i.e. image and ego-costs) in relation to subordinates and peers.

T1  - Cultural and Biological Determinants in the Evaluation of Urban Green Spaces
AN  - 580117788
AB  - Dramatically increasing urbanization is observable worldwide and brings pressure on space within urban areas as the built environment intensifies. Considerable evidence suggests that contact with nature is important for city dwellers, although it is not known whether residents' appreciation of the forms of urban green spaces is constant across different contexts. More specifically, it has not yet been shown whether our appreciation of nature is innate and inherently human, is cultural and something that we learn, or is a mixture of both. This article describes an exploratory study consisting of 17 interviews carried out in Zurich, Switzerland. Kelly's repertory grid technique is used to identify preferred urban landscapes, which were contrasted with identified rejected landscapes. Principle components analysis and multidimensional scaling reveal a clear separation of cultural and biological modes of landscape assessment in some respondents. The research contributes to an understanding of the meanings of urban green spaces, which would in turn provide planners with a tool to match urban natural resource management with the needs of residents.

T1  - Holistic approach to learning and teaching introductory object-oriented programming
AN  - 880189210
AB  - This article describes a holistic approach to designing an introductory, object-oriented programming course. The design is grounded in constructivism and pedagogy of phenomenography. We use constructive alignment as the framework to align assessments, learning, and teaching with planned learning outcomes. We plan learning and teaching activities, and media with an understanding of variation theory and the ways in which students learn to program. We outline the implementation of the course, and discuss the findings from the first cycle of an action research study with a small sample of undergraduate students. An investigation of the preferred (deep/surface) learning approaches of the students led us to believe that these approaches can be influenced through course design. Personal constructs of the students, elicited through the repertory grid technique, revealed that rich inventories of learning resources are highly valued. We comment on the transformational processes of the experience of the participants, and identify areas for further refinement and investigation in the next action research cycle.

T1  - Heart Disease; Researchers' work from King's College London, Department of Psychology focuses on heart disease
AN  - 207509618
AB  - Adult smokers (n=18) completed interviews and questionnaires using the repertory grid technique to elicit personal constructs underlying perceptions of effectiveness of a range of medical interventions (three to stop smoking, three to prevent heart disease, one to reduce pain, one to lose weight, and one to treat depression). Principle components analysis was applied to identify the key underlying dimensions within the constructs. Numerical estimates of the effectiveness of the interventions were also collected from participants to compare them with the published evidence. Constructs clustered around three dimensions: 'therapeutic impact,' 'behavior-dependent impact,' and 'impact facilitates general health.' Smokers perceived impacts that are dependent on the individuals' behavior to offer small therapeutic impacts, while facilitating individuals' general health.

AB  - This study aims to explore general practitioners' perceptions of the nature of 'effectiveness'. The design was qualitative in nature using the repertory grid technique to elicit the constructs underlying the perceived effectiveness of a range of medical interventions. Eight medical interventions were used as stimuli (diclophenac to reduce acute pain, cognitive behaviour therapy to treat depression, weight loss surgery to achieve weight loss, diet and exercise to prevent type 2 diabetes, statins to prevent heart disease, stopping smoking to prevent heart disease, nicotine replacement therapy to stop smoking, and stop smoking groups to stop smoking). The setting involved face-to-face interviews followed by questionnaires in London Primary Care Trusts. included a random sample of 13 general practitioners. Analysis of the ratings showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: low patient effort versus high patient effort (dimension one), and small impact versus large impact (dimension two).

T1  - Identifying Competencies of Volunteer Board Members of Community Sports Clubs
AN  - 231498133
AB  - This study contributes to the emerging empirical studies on roles and responsibilities of boards in nonprofit organizations by identifying competencies of volunteer board members. We identified how two types of constituents - volunteer board members and sports members - perceived competencies of volunteer board members in community sports clubs. We used the repertory grid technique to draw cognitive maps and to reveal the perceived reality of these constituents. Our results suggest that constituents within a group share similar perceptions of competencies of outstanding performing board members, whereas they agree less on perceptions of poor performing board members. This study reveals that cognitive (e.g., having a long-term vision, having professionalism), emotional intelligence (e.g., being reliable, being honest), and social intelligence (e.g., listening to others, being jovial/nice to be with) competencies are necessary to be perceived as an outstanding performing board member.

T1  - Assessment of destination brand associations: An application of Associative Network Theory and network analysis methods
AN  - 755287928
AB  - Recent tourism management research has seen increasing discussions of applying branding concepts into destination marketing. However, brand association and its importance in creating strong and unique brands have not been studied adequately. The purpose of this study was to identify the underlying dimensions that people use to describe destination brands and examine the structural relations of the destination's brand association.    Brand association focuses on analyzing the characteristics consumers' knowledge, perceptions and attitudes associated with a brand and how brand associations interact with each other. Research on brand association provides measurement constructs to evaluate branding effectiveness and offers marketing professionals the strategic information to build strong and unique brand identity.    Through two surveys (n=29) and individual interviews (n=13) using repertory grid method, the study elicited the brand associations of four golf destinations. Applying network analysis methods, the study examined the centralities and cohesion measures of those brand associations. The results identified brand associations that are critical in creating strong brand identities, controlling the activation other brand associations, or complement to each other. The study demonstrated the ability of network analysis in destination brand association research and provided an analytical tool for destination brand management.

T1  - Corporate Governance in the Debate on CSR and Ethics: Sensemaking of Social Issues in Management by Authorities and CEOs
AN  - 194911605
AB  - The goal of this exploratory cognitive study is to uncover how opinion leaders - CEOs and other authorities in the domain of social issues in management - understand and differentiate the various concepts pertaining to corporate governance, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and business ethics. This study extends the analysis to the whole spectrum of social issues in management. For this research 41 Repertory Grid Technique (RGT)  interviews were conducted in Belgium with top experts and CEOs of the Belgian economy and civil society. Both authorities and CEOs pragmatically and rather clearly differentiate the various concepts related to corporate governance, CSR, and business ethics. While CSR is seen as the best candidate for an umbrella term, no unified paradigm has yet to be achieved in the business and social field. Three basic concepts of corporate responsibility, corporate governance, and business ethics emerge as being complementary. Corporate governance has acquired an important place in the hierarchy of business and society concepts. Corporations cannot restrict their actions and communication regarding social issues in management to one single domain. Several complementary issues have to be addressed simultaneously.

Participants were interviewed using the repertory grid technique (RGT), a qualitative technique to explore individual values and preferences regarding specific choices and events. The participants generated distinctive patterns of personal constructs and ratings regarding prosthetic use and different prosthetic options available. The RGT produced a unique profile of preferences regarding prosthetic technologies for each participant. User choice is an important factor when matching prosthetic technology to the user. The consumer's values regarding different prosthetic options are likely to be a critical factor in prosthetic acceptance and ultimate quality of life," wrote E.

T1  - Development of a team measure for tacit knowledge in software development teams
AN  - 229558256
AB  - In this paper we operationally define and measure tacit knowledge at the team-level in the software development domain. Through a series of three empirical studies we developed and validated the team tacit knowledge measure (TTKM) for software developers. In the first study, initial scale items were developed using the repertory grid technique and content analysis. In Study 2, supplied repertory grids were administered to novices and experts to establish differential items, and Study 3 validated the TTKM on a sample of 48 industrial software development teams. In developing the TTKM we explored the relationships between tacit knowledge, explicit job knowledge and social interaction and their effect on team performance as measured by efficiency and effectiveness. In addition we assess the implications for managing software development teams and increasing team performance through social interaction. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Eliciting Cognitions of Strategizing Using Advanced Repertory Grids in a World Constructed and Reconstructed
AN  - 195092015
AB  - Previous application of the repertory grid technique in the strategy field has been noteworthy. However, all have been imprisoned by their adherence to strict element choice based on grid protocol. Elements in past studies have either focused on all competitor companies, or all strategic decisions, or all decision makers, or all strategic issues, inter alia, in an effort to learn more about how strategists see, interpret, and make sense of their strategy experiences. This research note outlines how current strategy research can be advanced by the use of more heterogeneous elements for grid applications, hence allowing researchers to go deeper into eliciting more complex strategic cognitions on how strategy is crafted and recrafted in a world constructed and reconstructed.

T1  - Relational schemas as sources of evaluation and misevaluation of leader-member exchanges: Some initial evidence
AN  - 200775188
AB  - We investigated whether dyad members' relational schemas, a cognitive representation of exchange experiences, would affect how leaders and members evaluate and misevaluate the quality of their exchange relationships. Based on data derived from repertory grid technique and two waves of survey data, we found that leaders and members tended to form different relational schemas of their partners. While leaders developed LMX schemas focusing on work-related issues, members' schemas focused more on interpersonal concerns. These findings confirmed that the different schemas employed by each party affect how they stored, retrieved and (mis)evaluated their LMX experiences with each other. Implications for theory and practice, limitations of this study, and future research directions are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Through the Eyes of Experts: A Socio-cognitive Perspective on the Automation of Fingerprint Work
AN  - 218135810
AB  - Prior research on technological frames indicates that many of the difficulties associated with systems implementation stem from differences in the meanings users, managers, and system developers attribute to automation projects. Although the concept of technological frames has been used to explore the bases for intergroup conflict during implementation, it is also a useful device for probing more deeply into the effects complex systems have on users' perceptions of their work and the role-altering effects of new technologies. Drawing upon personal construct theory and job characteristics theory, we adapted the  repertory grid technique to explore the technology-in- use frames of a group of occupationally certified fingerprint technicians (FPTs). Our investigation reveals the important role the FPTs' occupationally  defined values and norms played in structuring their existing work practices and the tensions produced by organizationally mandated efforts to restructure the logic of their expertise-based hierarchies. These insights illuminate the effects work redesign had on the FPTs' task environment, the process logic that guided specific work practices, and the roles defined by their expertise-based hierarchies, and provide a basis for understanding the FPTs' unanticipated reactions to it.

T1  - Job-matching and employee diversity: an exploratory study
AN  - 219241561
AB  - Purpose - The investigation reported here aims to: adapt existing recruitment theory to add to tools available to small business recruiters for job matching; provide job-specific scoring methods to help employers in recruitment processes; and enhance the consideration of reasonable adjustment issues in the possible employment of disabled individuals. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 32 interviews were conducted on-site with managers to devise and test templates combining person specifications with job characteristics, based on managers' judgements of what is important. The methods devised and used are an original adaptation of repertory grid principles. Where there were disabled employees, indications of the employees' success and difficulty were elicited. Findings - A simplified derivative of repertory grid method to give a combined abilities/tasks matrix was found usable and clarifying by respondents. Research limitations/implications - The investigation was confined to hotel and leisure small to medium-sized enterprises in Sussex, UK. As they stand, the methods could be used in business sectors beyond the sector to which the research reported in this paper has been confined, but further work is needed on resource consequences, and on the implications for state benefits and related support in the case of disabled applicants. Originality/value - Results of the analysis could be used almost immediately by a company: for future applicants, the company could make direct use of the completed matrix by scoring the applicant on the matrix variables, superimposing the applicant matrix on the requirements matrix, and calculating the percentage of desirable scores met.

T1  - An Empirical Assessment of User Perceptions of Feature versus Application Level Usage
AN  - 200722167
AB  - Users often use application software because of particular features. However, little remains known on whether user perceptions of application use is merely feature-driven or whether users perceive their application use as being more than an amalgamation of features. As the software industry ushers trends such as Web services, it becomes evermore important for vendors and users alike to clarify how users perceive features and applications. The paper is an attempt to confirm whether users can perceptively unbundle application software features from the overall applications themselves. Using a modified version of the repertory grid technique, this study investigates user perceptions of application features using data collected from users in the design and development departments across five firms. The results suggest that user perceptions of overall applications overshadow their perceptions of independent features, suggesting application-level lock-in effects and pointing out the difficulty in vendor attempts to unbundle features from feature categories and applications. The study closes with a discussion of the findings and offering cues for future research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - How Does Our Brain Constitute Defense Mechanisms? First-Person Neuroscience and Psychoanalysis
AN  - 235471098; 17426413
AB  - Current progress in the cognitive and affective neurosciences is constantly influencing the development of psychoanalytic theory and practice. However, despite the emerging dialogue between neuroscience and psychoanalysis, the neuronal processes underlying psychoanalytic constructs such as defense mechanisms remain unclear. One of the main problems in investigating the psychodynamic-neuronal relationship consists in systematically linking the individual contents of first-person subjective experience to third-person observation of neuronal states. We therefore introduced an appropriate methodological strategy, 'first-person neuroscience', which aims at developing methods for systematically linking first- and third-person data. The utility of first-person neuroscience can be demonstrated by the example of the defense mechanism of sensorimotor regression as paradigmatically observed in catatonia. Combined psychodynamic and imaging studies suggest that sensorimotor regression might be associated with dysfunction in the neural network including the orbitofrontal, the medial prefrontal and the premotor cortices. In general sensorimotor regression and other defense mechanisms are psychoanalytic constructs that are hypothesized to be complex emotional-cognitive constellations. In this paper we suggest that specific functional mechanisms which integrate neuronal activity across several brain regions (i.e. neuronal integration) are the physiological substrates of defense mechanisms. We conclude that first-person neuroscience could be an appropriate methodological strategy for opening the door to a better understanding of the neuronal processes of defense mechanisms and their modulation in psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

T1  - A repertory grid evaluation of a multidimensional theory of courage
AN  - 305174778
AB  - Courage is a fairly common expression of behavior, with benefits for society as well as the courageous actor. As often as it is identified in the media or literature, little research has directly studied courage as it has been difficult to define. Courage has been described as comprising three types: physical courage (i.e., physical action for a socially valued goal), moral courage (i.e., authentic expression of one's values and beliefs despite possible risk), and vital courage (i.e., perseverance to maintain physical or emotional well-being). This study sought to evaluate laypersons' views of the nature of courage. Two main questions were asked: how is courage conceptualized by people in everyday life, and how do other factors such as age and gender relate to views of courage? College-age adults and adults over age 40 completed a repertory grid measure used to compare courageous situations. The grid measure provided scores of construct integration (i.e., variability of intensity), level of differentiation among elements and constructs (i.e., construct ordination, element ordination), cognitive differentiation (i.e., matching score), and meaningfulness of ratings (i.e., extremity analysis). By categorizing the courageous situations provided by participants according to the type of courage suggested, moral courage was most frequently reflected by the situations. Younger and older adults were consistent in listing situations of moral courage most often, followed by vital and physical courage, respectively. One hypothesis was that there would be age-related differences on the repertory grid scores due to changes associated with aging and gaining life experience. The analyses demonstrated no differences among older and younger participants for the repertory grid scores, except for an effect of age on extremity analysis scores. A second hypothesis was that differences would be detected according to gender; this was not supported by analyses. Participants for this study were obtained from classes at Michigan State University, community centers in East Lansing, Michigan and personal contacts of the researcher. The lack of difference due to age or gender suggests few differences between how people conceptualize courage according to scores of construct integration or cognitive differentiation.

T1  - Behavioral activity associated with onset in chronic tic and habit disorder
AN  - 214424343
AB  - Seventy-six people (aged 18-62 years) diagnosed with either a chronic tic disorder or a habit disorder, entering a treatment study, kept a baseline daily diary for at least ten days, noting tic frequency and activity at time of onset. Together with an evaluator, participants completed a form ranking three high-risk activities where the tic or habit was likely to appear, and three low-risk activities where the tic was absent or barely present. Subjective appraisals distinguishing the two types of activities were also elicited and their relevance to the tic was measured on a seven-point scale using an adaptation of Kelly's repertory grid technique. Overall, the most frequent high-risk and low-risk activities were, respectively, passive attendance and physical activity. There were, however, significant differences in types of high-risk activities amongst the tic and habit disorders. Conversely, appraisals of the high-risk activities seemed to center on negative evaluations of tenseness, boredom, dissatisfaction, and disinterest.

T1  - Exploring teachers' instructional design practices from a systems design perspective
AN  - 740300641
AB  - Curricular changes in higher vocationaleducation have rendered teachers' instructionaldesign activities increasingly important. Usinga repertory grid technique, this paper sets outto analyse current design activities of tenteacher trainers. Their actual approach iscompared with an instructional systems design(ISD) approach and related to innovativeteacher roles. Teachers' activities show animbalance in two ID phases, that is problemanalysis and evaluation. The results suggestthat they attempt to translate curricular goalsdirectly into concrete lessons and they payrelatively little attention to evaluation. Inline with this finding, they underrate the twoinnovative teacher roles of the `diagnostician'and the `evaluator'. It is argued thatimbalanced or incomplete design approaches andperceived roles may hinder innovation ineducation. Implications for the support ofteachers' design activities are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Steps Across the Border – Cooperation, Knowledge Production and Systems Design
AN  - 2259953788
AB  - The computer support of cooperation andknowledge production across sociallydistributed activity systems has become animportant topic in the context of the discourseon ``knowledge management''. The present articlewill draw on concepts of cultural-historicalactivity theory to discuss the problem of howthe notion of ``knowledge'' is conceptualized andimplicitly implemented in computer systems tosupport knowledge management, often neglectingthe social embeddedness of knowledge productionin everyday work practices. From the point ofview of cultural-historical activity theory wewould propose to look upon the generation ofknowledge as a process embedded in sociallydistributed activities that are constantlybeing reproduced and transformed in and betweenspecific communities of practice. We willpresent a model of cooperation that relatesprocessual and structural aspects of jointactivity. Methodologically, it draws on theanalysis of unexpected events in the course ofjoint activity. Our model also proposes to useforums for co-construction to make visibledifferent perspectives in the process ofsoftware design. The concept of cooperativemodel production is highlighted as a means tomediate, not to eliminate, differences ofperspectives involved in the course of systemsdesign. An empirical example will be given inwhich the repertory-grid technique is used tovisualize similarities and differences ofpotential users' viewpoints and requirements inearly stages of systems design.

T1  - Facilities management in medium-sized UK hotels
AN  - 228363501
AB  - The paper explores the application and value of facilities management concepts in medium-sized UK hotels. Using the results of recent research into the extent and context of application of facilities management in hotels, some apparent advantages of the approach are identified. Facilities management is not a term commonly applied in hotels and the paper considers its value in this field. The hotel manager is in the business of generating revenue from space. If this space is well managed, in a strategic manner, there is considerable scope for improving not only revenue, but also profit. The research uses personal construct theory and repertory grid analysis to identify the aspects of managing facilities which are perceived as important by the owners/managers themselves. A model is then developed of the suggested application of facilities management within the medium-sized hotel sector.

Language does not seem to effect mental models of information retrieval systems.Herrera-Viedma, believes that quantitative weights computed from term occurrence are appropriate for the characterization of documents, but not for queries or the estimated relevance levels for ranking of retrieved documents, where human understanding argues for qualitative expression.

Relevance judgements were made on the basis of topical matching (aboutness) by the contributors of the queries reviewing the Union 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 52(6):443 444, 2001set of the responses to the query forms where each retrieved list was limited to a length 15 or less citations.

T1  - How do directors of public health perceive leadership?
AN  - 197359138
AB  - This study examines how directors of public health (DsPH) perceive effective leadership. Kelly's (1955) repertory grid technique is used. A total of 13 out of a possible 14 DsPH in one NHS region of England were interviewed. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were carried out. The findings show that male DsPH rate their leadership ability more highly than do female DsPH. Qualitative analysis produced a number of categories of constructs, some of which are perceived to be indicative of effective leadership, these being working for others, personal attributes, vision and innovation, and courage and integrity. Some categories appear to be applicable only to the UK (or to public health) and not to the existing dominant US models of leadership. In general, DsPH perceptions of effective leadership converge with current theories; most specifically the UK-based theories. This study therefore refutes any simple extrapolation of US theories of leadership to UK health organizations.

T1  - An investigation of the effectiveness of a voluntary sector psychodynamic counselling service
AN  - 218887247; 11003380
AB  - Clients attending a London voluntary sector counselling centre completed assessments pre- and post-psychodynamic counselling and at follow-up. Although there was a very high attrition rate following initial assessment, this did not appear to affect adversely the representativeness of the sample completing the later assessments. Clients were found to improve in terms of psychological well-being, control and various other aspects of their lives, and attributed many of the changes to counselling. Counsellors also rated the counselling as effective with most clients, and particularly those who were inner directed, had expectancies favourable towards psychotherapy, had greater perceived control over their lives, attended more sessions, and with whom an interaction/transference approach was taken. Clients with more severe problems showed less improvement in other areas of their lives. There was no difference in the outcome of clients seen by qualified and trainee counsellors.

T1  - Measurement of tourists' images: The repertory grid approach
AN  - 217442339
AB  - Repertory grids are suggested to be an underused method of eliciting tourists' images of potential destinations. However, repertory grids possess great potential in the field of tourism research. As opposed to methods commonly used in studies of image, the repertory grid approach is couched in well-tested psychological theory and avoids bias inherent in alternative methods due to prespecification of study attributes.

T1  - Characteristics of well-performing organisations in Singapore
AN  - 226850629
AB  - Very little is known about the characteristics of successful organizations which are located in the East. This paper seeks to add to this limited knowledge and, in so doing, uses 6 of Singapore's most successful companies as its sample. The repertory grid technique is used to analyze case studies relating to each of the 6 companies and appropriate concepts are developed. The results suggest that the 6 selected companies have become successful as a result of: 1. being customer oriented, 2. creating new products to enter existing markets, 3. having a clear vision and direction, 4. offering career training, and 5. having a disciplined informal professional atmosphere. Some of these characteristics may seem, on the surface, to be similar to those identified in Western organizations. Indeed, such values might be useful in interpreting the way that different organizations illustrate the 5 identified characteristics.

T1  - Theoretical papers: Effective leadership within hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Units
AN  - 197380563
AB  - In this study the Repertory Grid interview technique was used to investigate constructs of leadership held by a group of male and female senior managers from within hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Units (SPCUs) in the UK. The themes that emerged were compared with those from existing research models of leadership. Results: men and women in these roles describe different constructs of effective leadership. The women's constructs that emerged were predominantly transformational, while the men's were predominantly transactional Themes were also identified in this study, which differed from previous studies, i.e. those of political and environment awareness and the valuing of others' views regardless of their status. These themes do not feature highly in other research, and may be in response to the environment within which hospice and specialist palliative care functions.

AB  - Until recently little attention has been given in Accounting and Finance literature to the problem of linking the results of financial evaluation techniques such as Net Present Value (NPV) and Shareholder Value Analysis (SVA) to managers' cognitive evaluation of strategic factors and the risk profile of projects.  Various authors have called for research in this area, but very little has so far been published.  This paper reports on a field-based study carried out in the logistics industry. It builds on earlier research, which elicited constructs that managers use to assess project risk using a repertory grid technique.   It provides an insight into how a project risk analysis process can be linked with project returns in strategic investment appraisal (SIA) in a divisionalised organisation. An action research approach was taken to develop a decision matrix to link the risk assessment results to expected project returns as an aid to management in strategic investment decision-making. It is now embedded in the investment appraisal procedures across the European group of companies that participated in the research. It is suggested that the framework adopted in this experimental study is transferable to other organisational contexts.

T1  - Project risk assessment: A European field study
AN  - 204773608; 00740386
AB  - A field-based study was carried out in the logistics industry, which followed an innovative action research approach, operationalized by the use of focus groups and repertory grids.  Using a repertory grid technique, constructs were elicited, which managers used to explain the riskiness of a particular project, compared to other projects of a similar type that they had knowledge of from past investment appraisals.  The results include a set of 12 project risk attributes, a project typology which defines 3 types of projects, each with a set of weightings reflecting the relative importance of the attributes to the participants.  These provide a useful insight into managers' perceptions of the risk attached to strategic investment projects in a large European group.  In addition to the context-specific results, conclusions are drawn regarding the use of repertory grids as a framework for a risk assessment technique in other organizational settings.

T1  - A model for subcontractor selection in refurbishment projects
AN  - 213188400; 01830318
AB  - A model is presented for analyzing the subcontractor's risk elements in construction refurbishment projects.  The system is based on the use of fuzzy set theory with the fuzzy set representing the overall weighted average rating of refurbishment contractors criterion for the selection of subcontractors.  A prototype knowledge based expert system is described, which provides a systematic and objective approach to the selection of subcontractors.  Knowledge elicitation methodology using the repertory grid technique is detailed.  The implementation of a subcontractor selection and appointment model for refurbishment contractors in linguistic terms allows the user to interact with the system in a very friendly manner using natural language expressions.

T1  - An exploration of students' personal constructs: Implications for clinical teaching in psychiatric mental health nursing
AN  - 304422586
AB  - Despite revolutionary rhetoric in the nursing education literature calling for collaborative student centered learning, few opportunities actually exist, particularly in the psychiatric clinical teaching area, to include the voices of student nurses in the scholarly dialogue surrounding their learning. This thesis was designed to understand students' own ways of knowing during their six-week mental health practicums on acute hospital units. A constructivist conceptual perspective and George Kelly's personal construct psychology are the theoretical bases of the research. Qualitative methodology using the case study approach was used to describe the experiences of six Canadian second year nursing students from their own perspectives. Data sources included before and after repertory grids, a questionnaire and audiotape-recorded transcribed interviews. Content was theme analyzed, Vee Heuristic diagramed and concept mapped. The case studies were written collaboratively with students and member checking by correspondence six months after the practicum ended confirmed that the reports authentically narrated the personal construct changes which occurred, or did not occur, as a result of the course. The study spanned three years, included a pilot project and incorporated the resulting student "stories" into a clinical curriculum. The case reports are snapshot portrayals of how student nurses construed the professional activities they observed on hospital units which recently underwent organizational changes. They reflect human faces behind the paradigm shifts occurring in nursing education and health care. The following four overarching themes represent key findings. The research approach invited constructivist teaching. Students' anxiety related more to feeling unable to help than to mentally ill patients. Students felt a lack of inclusion in staff nurse groups. Non evaluated student-instructor discussion time was vitally important. Suggestions for clinical teaching strategies are made to assist instructors in the selection of experiences which can help link university curricula to hospital practicum sites. The research contributes to the conceptualization of how students learn nursing by re-valuing what they bring to clinical experiences, by increasing understanding of what students find engaging or difficult and by developing a pedagogical mode of inquiry which extends clinical instruction beyond demonstration and evaluation to creating a space for student perceptions.

T1  - Images of a culture in transition: Personal constructs of organizational stability and change
AN  - 199401329; 01501351; 03392227
AB  - An investigation was undertaken in a large government business enterprise in a bid to examine the utility of the repertory grid technique in the investigation of organizational culture and to conduct an "audit" of performance culture.  The development of a methodology is described to gauge the rate of up-take of a new culture - from a public service orientation towards a customer service orientation.  Schein's (1990) theoretical framework was adopted in developing a 2-stage approach to the collection of data, which incorporated qualitative (in-depth interviews), and quantitative (survey) methods.  Results indicated that there was progress in the direction of the new culture desired by management.  There were 3 active cultures or groupings, articulated through the language of participants, which essentially mirrored a culture transition: those who had adopted the new culture, those who had partially adopted the new culture, and those who had not adopted the new culture.

T1  - "In the Eye of the Beholder": A New Approach to Studying Folk Theories of Leadership
AN  - 2181259982
AB  - Awareness that questionnaire ratings of leaders may be subject to systematic errors has led to increased emphasis on understanding the perceptual/memory processes underlying leadership ratings. Subordinates may judge leadership effectiveness based on their implicit leadership theories. Folk theories of leadership refers to these deeply felt and idiosyncratic theories of leadership behaviors. Borman's (1983) "Trait-Implication Procedure" based on Kelly's Repertory Grid technique was used to examine the leadership categorization schema of ten senior executives from a wide variety of organizations. Results indicate some association between the folk theories of leadership and the background/experience of the respondent. Implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.

AN  - 213757331; 01318524
AB  - The repertory grid technique is used as the main research instrument for eliciting drivers' knowledge to explore the factors that have impact on seat belt use.  Principal components analysis identified 5 factors underlying drivers' risk assessments: severity, predictability/foreseeability, fault, frequency/unsafe behavior, and hit/air bag impact.  The results show that the perceived risk and perceived importance of seat belt use are influenced by situational factors: the direction of collision, the location of collision, and the existence of an air bag system.  The implication is that belt use campaigns might be more successful if they focused on modifying perceived risk.

T1  - The structure and content of organizational identity in hypercompetitive environments
AN  - 304164476
AB  - This research explored the structure and content of the organizational identity--members' beliefs about central, distinctive, and enduring organizational attributes--for a high performing organization operating in a rapidly and discontinuously changing hypercompetitive environment. The study compared the dimensions of organizational attributes provided by members for similarities and differences across subunits and the organization as a whole. Analyses examined the extent to which organizational identity attributes are shared, and assessed the potential existence of distinct, coherent subidentities across geographic locations, business units, and organizational levels. The study also examined a new theory of organizational identity structure and content. This theory posits that intangible aspects of organizational identity will be more central than substantive elements in high performing organizations. As a first step in validating this theory, the study examined whether organizational identity dimensions for a hypercompetitive organization can validly be classified into intangible and substantive categories.    A sample of Intel Corporation employees completed an instrument based on a method that originated in cognitive psychology, the repertory grid technique. This method allowed organization members to identify dimensions of organizational attributes of Intel without the imposition of the researcher's frame of reference. This technique provided insights into the cognitive frameworks members hold regarding their high performance organization in a hypercompetitive environment.    The study found that organization members do share organizational identity attributes, although the number of widely shared attributes is small. Additionally, when members rated various organizational identity components along self-supplied dimensions, they made significant distinctions between current and ideal organizational identity. Evidence also was discovered supporting the existence of distinct subidentities by location, business unit, and organizational level. Preliminary support was obtained for the classification of identity attributes as either intangible or substantive.    The major theoretical contributions of this research are the verification of shared organizational identity attributes, the documentation of distinct organizational subidentities, and a theory of two types of organizational identity attributes for hypercompetitive organizations was proposed and tested. This study's primary methodological contribution is the application of a promising methodology for the study of organizational identity.

T1  - You're stopping me from giving quality service
AN  - 228367288; 00861423
AB  - Quality initiatives need to be translated into actions by employees.  The importance of eliciting the knowledge and beliefs that employees use to guide their decisions at work is highlighted, and it is argued that everyday discourse (for example, conversation and group discussion) is an inadequate basis from which to unearth this information.  A variety of psychological techniques that can be used to help people "get at" their own views are outlined.  A study is reported that used situational interviewing and the repertory grid technique to elicit the models that food servers in the hospitality industry have of internal systems and procedures.  The "maps" that food servers have of service situations and colleagues reveal areas for quality improvement.

T1  - Management Consultancy: Dimensions of Client-Consultancy Relationships
AN  - 1698137239
AB  - Although a great deal of management consultancy has been carried out in a wide variety of settings, very little research has been conducted examining underlying dimensions of the client-consultant relationship. The present study examines consultant and client perceptions of the consulting relationship. A procedure based on repertory grid technique was employed to elicit dimensions of client consultant relationships from 22 management consultants and 16 of their clients within a major UK company. A questionnaire was then developed in order to determine the importance and frequency of these dimensions to participants, and also to highlight the differences between the views of clients and consultants. Dimensions were found to fall within four broad categories: those relating to the client; those relating to the consultant; dimensions associated with contract details; and dimensions focused on relationship building. While both clients and consulting relationships, they differed in emphasis they placed on the different categories. More specifically, consultants viewed dimensions relating to relationship building as most important, while clients placed greater emphasis on dimensions associated with contract details. Recommendations, based on these findings are made for monitoring and enhancing client-consultant relationships.

T1  - Intuition in Venture Capital Decisions: An Exploratory Study Using a New Technique
AN  - 195844086; 00497375; 00270535
AB  - An exploratory study used the repertory grid technique, drawn from personal construct psychology, to develop an understanding of intuition.  In-depth interviews with 5 venture capitalists were conducted to obtain information about the particular constructs each uses in thinking about investment proposals.  The goal was to obtain systematic data on the content and structure of intuitions prior to the development of a questionnaire to be issued to a larger sample.  The results indicated that investment constructs can be grouped into 3 areas: management, unique opportunity, and appropriate return.  A cluster analysis showed that each venture capitalist had his own way of structuring the intuitions involved in the investment decision.  The results suggested that individuals seeking venture capital may need to adjust their approach to different venture capitalists in view of the diversity involved.

T1  - Building Societies as Retail Banks: The Importance of Customer Service and Corporate Image
AN  - 231439820; 00449302; 00097163
AB  - UK building societies have successfully attracted funds in a deregulated environment; however, they have begun to lose some of their dominance in the mortgage market.  In a more competitive environment, building societies are diversifying and using more effective marketing techniques.  They have tended to distinguish themselves from competitors by emphasizing qualitative factors, such as friendliness and quality of service.  A survey on the topic of financial institutions was made of 30 individuals using Kelly's (1955) Repertory Grid technique.  It was found that building societies were perceived as distinct from banks in terms of traditional functions.  Building societies were generally considered more friendly, and banks were perceived as more efficient and businesslike.  Building societies have a competitive edge in terms of their favorable image, which they should emphasize in their attempts to develop stronger corporate identities.

T1  - Cognitive Performance Appraisal -- Mapping Managers' Category Structures Using the Grid Technique
AN  - 214807150; 00377095
AB  - The repertory grid technique, a systematic method for eliciting the constructs that make up a person's cognitive structure, permits the mapping of a manager's frame of reference toward employee performance.  After selecting the elements to be used in obtaining managers' reference frames toward employee performance, the logical elements, i.e., the employees under the manager's supervision, are divided randomly into triads.  The manager is asked to show ways in which each combination of 2 employees varies from a 3rd.  This typically generates a construct mix related to personal traits of the employee and job performance.  The manager differentiates between triads until all personal constructs are exhausted and, by using a 5- or 7-point scale, rates the extent to which each employee is characterized by each construct.  Rating all elements in terms of all constructs produces a standard matrix or grid.  Several indexes can be constructed on the basis of the completed grid: 1.  frame differentiation, 2.  frame complexity, 3.  frame integration, 4.  construct centrality, and 5.  construct ranking.

T1  - Portrayals of Teacher Development
AN  - 1979471370
AB  - The paper presents an ideographic research approach that is being developed to describe the career biographies of individual teachers. These 'portrayals' were seen as a means for exploring the notion of professional development and the personal and contextual conditions that bear upon it. Interviews, together with a variation on the repertory grid technique, were used with two experienced teachers as the means for constructing their phenomenological life-worlds. Implications for in-service education policies and strategies are drawn from the case studies, and a case is presented for the importance of developing models of teacher development complementary to models of curriculum innovation.

T1  - Investigating occupational stress: a methodological approach: SUMMARY
AN  - 227214073
AB  - One of the main methodological difficulties in carrying out research in the field of occupational stress is the use of pre-designed health and behavioural questionnaires. This has the serious disadvantage of either not including important stressors at work or distorting the importance of those that are included. This article describes the use of the Repertory Grid technique in identifying sources and manifestations of occupational stress which overcomes this obstacle. A detailed description of the Grid technique as it was applied to air traffic controllers is provided.
