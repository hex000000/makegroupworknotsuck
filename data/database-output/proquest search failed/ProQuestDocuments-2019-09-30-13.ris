T1  - Communicating healthier food choice- Food composition data, front-of-pack nutrition labelling and health claims
AN  - 1889864397
AB  - Background: Food composition data, front-of-pack nutrition labelling and nutrition and health claims have an important role to play in the development of appropriate policy, regulation and public health interventions ultimately aimed at reducing the burden of diet-related chronic disease. The overarching aim of this thesis is to explore whether the communication of healthier food choice through front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition labelling and health claims can be enhanced by the development of consumer derived frameworks (typologies) of these domains, a greater understanding of the degree to which the different FOP labelling schemes impact on consumer health inferences and an improved approach to the sharing of food composition data between stakeholders. Method: The potential for more effective approaches to the transfer of food composition data on processed foods, was explored via a survey conducted within the UK food industry (Study 1). To facilitate the development of a consumer derived typology of FOP nutrition labelling schemes in Europe, a free-sorting study utilising the ‘Multiple Sort Procedure’ (MSP) was performed in four countries; France, Poland, Turkey and the United Kingdom (Study 2). Building on the MSP methodology utilised in Study 2, a further study on nutrition and health claims was performed in five countries; Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom. (Study 3). The final study in this thesis sought to quantify the extent to which consumer perceptions of healthiness are impacted by the interpretative elements of the prevalent FOP labelling schemes in four countries; Germany, Poland, Turkey and the United Kingdom (Study 4). Conclusion: The outcomes of this research propose an optimised approach to the sharing of food composition data, an optimised approach to FOP labelling and consumer derived typologies for both the FOP labelling and nutrition and health claims domains.

T1  - Tacit Knowledge Capture and the Brain-Drain at Electrical Utilities
AN  - 1795527903
AB  - As a consequence of an aging workforce, electric utilities are at risk of losing their most experienced and knowledgeable electrical engineers. In this research, the problem was a lack of understanding of what electric utilities were doing to capture the tacit knowledge or know-how of these engineers. The purpose of this qualitative research study was to explore the tacit knowledge capture strategies currently used in the industry by conducting a case study of 7 U.S. electrical utilities that have demonstrated an industry commitment to improving operational standards. The research question addressed the implemented strategies to capture the tacit knowledge of retiring electrical engineers and technical personnel. The research methodology involved a qualitative embedded case study. The theories used in this study included knowledge creation theory, resource-based theory, and organizational learning theory. Data were collected through one time interviews of a senior electrical engineer or technician within each utility and a workforce planning or training professional within 2 of the 7 utilities. The analysis included the use of triangulation and content analysis strategies. Ten tacit knowledge capture strategies were identified: (a) formal and informal on-boarding mentorship and apprenticeship programs, (b) formal and informal off-boarding mentorship programs, (c) formal and informal training programs, (d) using lessons learned during training sessions, (e) communities of practice, (f) technology enabled tools, (g) storytelling, (h) exit interviews, (i) rehiring of retirees as consultants, and (j) knowledge risk assessments. This research contributes to social change by offering strategies to capture the know-how needed to ensure operational continuity in the delivery of safe, reliable, and sustainable power.

T1  - Strategies for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises to Engage Third-Party Logistics Providers
AN  - 1794167113
AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) managers struggle to stay competitive. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the strategies SME managers located in Canada use to engage third-party logistics (3PL) providers to improve their supply chains. Porter’s value chain theory formed the conceptual framework for this study. Data collection included semistructured interviews with 3 managers from 3 different SMEs in the province of Ontario and a review of the documents related to the use of 3PL providers. Member checking was conducted to enhance credibility of interpretation of the data collected. Data analysis was used to identify key themes, and data triangulation was performed on data from interviews and relevant company documents. Main themes that indicated the benefits of 3PL providers were identified through data analysis. The main themes included access to resources, competitive advantage, and enhanced customer service. Study findings may contribute to social change by helping SME managers improve their survival rate in Canada, maintain or create employment, and generate more personal income and taxes.

T1  - Engineering design: A cognitive process approach
AN  - 1652477639
AB  - The intent of this dissertation was to identify the cognitive processes used by advanced pre-engineering students to solve complex engineering design problems. Students in technology and engineering education classrooms are often taught to use an ideal engineering design process that has been generated mostly by educators and curriculum developers. However, the review of literature showed that it is unclear as to how advanced pre-engineering students cognitively navigate solving a complex and multifaceted problem from beginning to end. Additionally, it was unclear how a student thinks and acts throughout their design process and how this affects the viability of their solution. Therefore, Research Objective 1 was to identify the fundamental cognitive processes students use to design, construct, and evaluate operational solutions to engineering design problems. Research Objective 2 was to determine identifiers within student cognitive processes for monitoring aptitude to successfully design, construct, and evaluate technological solutions. Lastly, Research Objective 3 was to create a conceptual technological and engineering problem-solving model integrating student cognitive processes for the improved development of problem-solving abilities.   The methodology of this study included multiple forms of data collection. The participants were first given a survey to determine their prior experience with engineering and to provide a description of the subjects being studied. The participants were then presented an engineering design challenge to solve individually. While they completed the challenge, the participants verbalized their thoughts using an established "think aloud" method. These verbalizations were captured along with participant observational recordings using point-of-view camera technology. Additionally, the participant design journals, design artifacts, solution effectiveness data, and teacher evaluations were collected for analysis to help achieve the research objectives of this study. Two independent coders then coded the video/audio recordings and the additional design data using Halfin's (1973) 17 mental processes for technological problem-solving.   The results of this study indicated that the participants employed a wide array of mental processes when solving engineering design challenges. However, the findings provide a general analysis of the number of times participants employed each mental process, as well as the amount of time consumed employing the various mental processes through the different stages of the engineering design process. The results indicated many similarities between the students solving the problem, which may highlight voids in current technology and engineering education curricula. Additionally, the findings showed differences between the processes employed by participants that created the most successful solutions and the participants who developed the least effective solutions. Upon comparing and contrasting these processes, recommendations for instructional strategies to enhance a student's capability for solving engineering design problems were developed. The results also indicated that students, when left without teacher intervention, use a simplified and more natural process to solve design challenges than the 12-step engineering design process reported in much of the literature. Lastly, these data indicated that students followed two different approaches to solving the design problem. Some students employed a sequential and logical approach, while others employed a nebulous, solution centered trial-and-error approach to solving the problem. In this study the participants who were more sequential had better performing solutions. Examining these two approaches and the student cognition data enabled the researcher to generate a conceptual engineering design model for the improved teaching and development of engineering design problem solving.

T1  - Memory in transition: Historical consciousness and civic attitudes among youth in "postwar" Guatemala
AN  - 1647750810
AB  - In the aftermath of mass violence, history education that depicts the violent past is considered an essential element of transitional justice processes, clarifying the historical record, reestablishing moral frameworks, promoting reconciliation, and acknowledging public memory of past atrocity for future generations. But how do individuals and communities narrate recent injustice in ways that empower youth, foster civic agency, and promote democratic culture? And how does this story shift or lose credibility when the transitional justice process fails to transform society? This study centers on Guatemala in the aftermath of a thirty-six-year "armed conflict" (1960-1996), which included ethnic genocide. More than a decade after peace negotiations, Guatemala's "postwar" context is characterized by pervasive violence and impunity, and is consistently referred to as a failing state at risk of renewed conflict.    Comprising a multi-sited ethnography, this study documents the way that adolescents at four schools, embedded in distinct urban and rural communities, make meaning of their country's history of authoritarianism, while developing their civic identities within a struggling democracy. Through multi-year ethnographic data, this research demonstrates how adolescents' construction of the violent past functions as a mediator in their development as civic actors, illustrating the way that youth draw on historical understanding in everyday interactions, as they decide whether to engage with, trust, question, or challenge fellow citizens and the institutional structures that organize their society.   Civic attitudes and actions are critical components of democratic culture, yet we know little about the mechanisms underlying civic development, the quality of educational experiences that nurture this growth, and how young people shape their civic identities after the human rights and civil contracts have been egregiously violated. Drawing on youth perspectives, this research contributes to a body of knowledge dedicated to improving the quality of education in states undergoing democratic transition, while expanding the empirical base for civic education.

T1  - The role of computer mediated communication (CMC) media in patient empowerment: A "uses and gratifications" perspective
AN  - 1615374017
AB  - Empowerment has been studied extensively in the field of psychology for more than three decades. Extant research in the area of empowerment is often at the employee level in an employee-employer relationship or at the team level in an organizational setting. However, research that examines the role of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) media in consumer empowerment in the healthcare context has been neglected in the Information Systems (IS) literature. This dissertation uses three studies to address this gap in IS literature.      In Study 1, an interpretive approach using a qualitative methodology was used to understand patients' motivations and barriers for health information seeking and/or sharing online. Results from the interviews showed that there are seven major motivations and barriers dimensions namely media-enabled health information seeking, health output quality produced by media, media-enabled health-related content management and communication, media-enabled convenience, media-enabled health information sharing, and media-enabled health problem solving and decision-making.      In Study 2, a positivist approach using a survey methodology was used to test a research model linking the motivations and barriers dimensions identified in Study 1 to CMC media use and patient empowerment. The Uses and Gratifications theory was used to categorize the seven motivations and barriers dimensions identified in Study 1 into the three gratifications, namely, content gratifications, process gratifications, and social gratifications. Results from a national survey of 230 patients showed that content gratifications and social gratifications are positively related to CMC media use for health information seeking and/or sharing online, and that CMC media use for health information seeking and/or sharing online is positively related to patient empowerment.      In Study 3, a survey methodology was used to examine the consequences of CMC media-enabled patient empowerment. Survey results showed that patient empowerment positively impacts quality of care, patient coping with illness, and patient confidence in treatment, and that quality of care mediates the relationship between patient empowerment and patient satisfaction.     Together, the three studies help understand the role CMC media play in empowering healthcare consumers thereby addressing calls from IS researchers to focus on the consumer-perspective on the use of health information technologies (HIT).

T1  - Guiding the Work of Professional Learning Communities: Perspectives for School Leaders
AN  - 1559188618
AB  - Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are groups of educators committed to working collaboratively in ongoing processes of collective inquiry and action research to achieve better results for the students they serve.  PLCs operate under the assumption that the key to improved learning for students is continuous job-embedded learning for educators (DuFour, DuFour, Eaker, & Many, 2006).  Researchers and practitioners agree that PLCs are critical to the overall success of schools.  The problem is that implementing PLCs with fidelity to an inquiry process is a real challenge.  Most school districts do not have a systematic or comprehensive approach to guide their PLC process.  School leaders are in need of quality tools and resources to assist them in implementing PLCs.    As a possible solution to this problem, a design team of four Estacada School District principals and one vice principal was convened to create, field-test and refine a handbook for PLC leadership.  The handbook was field-tested in four schools and evaluated to determine its usefulness.  The study's primary research questions were: (a) Is the PLC handbook a useful resource for school leaders? and (b) What are the handbook's strengths and weaknesses?  Secondary research questions focused on specific topics and sections of the handbook: (a) How do school leaders organize and support a PLC framework? (b) How can PLCs support school change initiatives? (c) How can PLCs gather and analyze student data? (d) How can PLCs plan for future action? and (e) How can PLCs troubleshoot challenges?    The design team relied on a problem-based learning approach (Bridges & Hallinger, 1995) and the use of a research and development process (Borg & Gall, 1989) to design an educational product ready for operational use in their schools.  The design team met weekly for regularly scheduled meetings.  They used the Critical Friends Consultancy Protocol (Harmony Education Center, 2013) as a systematic way to problem solve and collect qualitative data. The data collected from these sessions were transcribed, coded for themes, and analyzed.  Other data sources that were used included the review of institutional documentation, structured interviews with teacher leaders, and survey results.  The design team then refined its PLC handbook through the first seven steps of the research and development process: (a) Research and information collecting; (b) Planning objectives, learning activities, and small scale testing; (c) Developing a preliminary form of the product; (d) Preliminary field-testing; (e) Main product revision; (f) Main field-testing; and (g) Operational product revision.    The design team determined that the handbook was in fact a useful resource for school leaders, and it helped move PLC work forward in each of the four schools.  The team found that the handbook had a number of strengths, including the clarification of key terminology and the establishment of a common language for PLCs.  Another noted strength was that the activities included in the handbook were user-friendly.  A noted opportunity was that the field-tested handbook did not create viable ways to involve parents, families, and community members in PLC work alongside educators.  This opportunity is being addressed by the design team in future handbook revisions.   The handbook helped school leaders organize and support a PLC framework.  The design team confirmed that the handbook assisted PLCs in completing the work required of major school change initiatives, including Differentiated Instruction/Sheltered Instruction, Response to Intervention/Positive Behavioral Intervention Support, Common Core State Standards, and Proficiency-Based Learning.  The design team also found the PLC handbook to be useful as an orientation tool for new staff members, as well as a valuable review tool for PLC veterans, particularly regarding how to collect and analyze student assessment data.  The handbook also helped PLCs plan future action relative to providing intervention and enrichment opportunities for students.  Finally, the handbook provided tools to help educators troubleshoot challenges that surfaced during their PLC work.    The design team will continue to refine its handbook and provide support for the Estacada School District and community as mutually-beneficial PLC-related activities, grants, and projects are pursued.  The optimal next step for future use of the handbook would be for several schools and districts throughout Oregon, particularly from small, rural areas, to pilot the handbook.  The piloting schools and districts could then share the roadblocks and success stories pertinent to their use of the handbook, which would in turn support the design team in making a quality final product revision.

T1  - Cross-sector segmentation: A framework for collaborative alliances between nonprofit and for-profit organizations
AN  - 1032539407
AB  - This study examined how market segmentation strategy can assist nonprofit organizations to identify potential corporate partners, establish collaborative alliances, and secure new sources of capital. Recent economic concerns and increases in competition have seriously affected the nonprofit's business environment. Therefore, a proactive approach is essential, so nonprofits can successfully secure desperately needed capital and continue to provide for those less fortunate. The study seeks a better understanding of the construct of alliance formation. Existing literature on alliances mostly focused on the nature of alliances; much less has been written about characteristics of alliance partners. Based on limited empirical evidence, this study integrated partner and partnership characteristics to develop a comprehensive theory of alliances. The research was conducted with the assistance and cooperation of several nonprofit organizations located in the tri-county area of South Florida. Participating nonprofit organizations were surveyed using several scales adapted from extant literature. Multiple regression technique, specifically stepwise regression was utilized to examine the hypothesized relationships between the dependent and independent (4) variables. Results indicated that organizational memory, governance, and firmographics were correlated to alliance formation and significant. However, the correlation between organizational culture and alliance formation was weak and not significant, despite extant literature review to the contrary. Further research is recommended to explicate causes for this lack of strength between organizational culture and alliance formation.

T1  - Managing web projects in academic libraries
AN  - 898964480
AB  - The activities used "rarely" or "never" by 50% or more of respondents - or in other words, used by the fewest respondents - were computing return on investment/analyzing cost-benefit, writing a software quality assurance test plan, creating a PERT chart, requiring change request forms, creating a [Gantt] chart or schedule, and budgeting for outsourcing, hardware, software. Responses related to budgeting for in-house staff time were in almost-equal proportions: about as many did this "frequently" or "sometimes" as "rarely" or "never."              The respondents were asked to indicate if members of the committee included "representatives from throughout your library" (hereafter referred to as "representatives"), "technical and design professionals" (hereafter referred to as "web professionals"), or "other" with a text entry option. The majority of the 59 committees described included representatives (85%) and web professionals (64%), with 56% of them including both representatives and web professionals. Twenty-nine percent of the groups were composed of representatives without web professionals, while only a small number (8%) were web professionals without representatives. Among the "other" text responses, 7% of the groups included administrators and 3% included students.              This survey supports existing literature about the myriad ways web project management fits into someone's job and into a library organization. Based on this survey's results, web projects in academic libraries are often managed by the same individuals, but they hold numerous types of positions in a wide variety of library departments. Information technology and systems-related departments predominate, but many people work in public services or administration. Even people who claim to manage "all" or "most" of their library's web projects have plenty of job responsibilities that are not web-project-related, and in this group, project management is likely not to be listed as a job responsibility - only 31% of those who managed "all" or "most" of their institution's web projects include it in their job descriptions. Yet, they spend an average of 36% of their time on management activities such as project planning, communicating, and implementing. In fact, of all respondents, only 39% have project management included in their job descriptions. In addition, the group that manage "all or most" projects also frequently engage in web development activities, are responsible for the library web site and support or train others in web-related tasks. It is somewhat disturbing to think such people are doing so without having this in their job descriptions. This suggests project management came about not by intention, but as a result of their other web roles. These findings highlight a need for libraries to review job descriptions where project management duties may have become a regular part of the job. Libraries also need to review job descriptions for those who engage in web development activities to be sure these duties are explicitly stated. In addition to ensuring an accurate description of the job, this ensures individuals have time, official authority, and appropriate skills to engage in these mission-critical activities. In some cases, libraries may need to create new position descriptions to support web project management. While most libraries struggle to add new positions, there may be opportunities to redefine an existing job when someone retires or is interested in exploring a new area of expertise.              4 Barry Z.

T1  - Exploring Teacher Identity: Teachers' Transformative Experiences of Re-Constructing and Re-Connecting Personal and Professional Selves
AN  - 923876087
AB  - This research explored the complexity of language teacher identity from a holistic perspective involving two features: the integration of teachers' personal and professional experiences, and the application of conscious/rational and intuitive/tacit thought processes.     The study examined four ESL teachers' beliefs, perceptions, and interpretations about the influences of their important personal, educational, and professional experiences on the development of their teacher identity. It also investigated the overall impact of an autobiographical reflective process combined with a guided visualization activity on the re-construction of participants' perceptions of teacher identity.     The interdisciplinary theoretical orientation was grounded in theories and concepts from psychology and educational research, e.g., Personal Construct Theory (Kelly, 1955, 1963), the complementary nature of reason and intuition, and the concept of “perspective transformation” (Mezirow, 1978, 2000). The methodology was heuristic research (Moustakas, 1990, 1994) and methods included reflexive autobiographical journaling, guided visualization, and in-depth interviews.    The results confirm that teacher identity is deeply embedded in one's personal biography. Participants' beliefs, perceptions, and interpretations nurtured in the family environment strongly influenced their school experiences, career choice, instructional practice, teaching philosophy, and teacher identity. The use of the guided visualization technique, integrated with rational reflection, considerably enhanced the depth and breadth of participants' self-understanding and personal/professional growth, which is an important methodological contribution of the study for teacher development.    The results strongly suggest that it is essential to explore teachers' personal life experiences in order to gain a holistic understanding of the dominant influences on the development of teacher identity. The study presents a model for designing a longitudinal professional development program offered in a series of workshops to raise teachers' awareness of the implicit influences on teacher identity and instructional practice through the application of both conscious/rational and intuitive/tacit methods to access their beliefs, perceptions, and interpretations of their life experiences.

T1  - The Building of a Trust Relationship between a Nurse and Parent in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
AN  - 875239887
AB  - Defined from a parents' perspective, the purpose of this study was to determine which conditions of trust are necessary for a trust relationship between a nurse and parent in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The research hypothesis proposed that if a specific set of trust conditions occurred, then interpersonal trust would develop between a NICU nurse and parent.    The research employed an explanatory two phased, mixed methods design using John K. Butler's Conditions of Trust Inventory (1991) survey to generate data relevant to the research question and follow up interviews to further explain the quantitative components. A convenience sample of 100 parents whose children had been patients for a minimum of 14 days in the NICU and discharged live participated in the survey, and as follow up, 11 parents and 5 NICU nurses joined in the interview portion of the study.    Measuring ten conditions, behaviors considered include competence, availability, consistency, discreteness, integrity, fairness, loyalty, promise fulfillment, receptivity, trust, and openness. An Exploratory Factor Analysis was applied to identify statistical correlations of survey data. Factor loading of the conditions identified items clustered on themes registering a minimum of .700 during the extraction process. The four themes included receptivity and competence, promise fulfillment, openness, and availability explaining 60.37% of the variance.    The qualitative phase provided descriptive narrative derived from open-ended questions related to each condition of trust. The interviews were coded and analyzed, offering clarification of survey detail. Data recognized in the primary source was supported by the qualitative findings with expanded themes around availability, competency, and consistency/promise fulfillment. In addition, parents and nurses introduced the theme of nursing control.    Overall, the study strongly supported that parents do perceive certain conditions as essential components of a trust relationship with a NICU nurse. Findings suggest that a parent's trust of a NICU nurse is built upon expectation of technical competency but measured in a nurse's goodwill competency. In addition, parents defined the trust relationship as a consistent partnership with a nurse based upon openness, receptivity, and availability.

T1  - Making sense of evolving health information: Navigating uncertainty in everyday life
AN  - 1269794581
AB  - While evidence-based practice and knowledge translation (or transfer) has garnered much attention, research has not focused on health information as provisional and emergent, and on knowledge translation (KT) as a process of social construction. The challenge of evolving information is magnified within everyday life contexts where informal and formal sources mediate health information. This qualitative study explores the experiences of women as they respond to and make sense of uncertain health information mediated by diverse sources (including health professionals (HPs), media, internet, and intrapersonal and interpersonal sources). A medical case in which evidence is explicitly evolving—health management during the menopause transition—facilitated exploration of information use and personal health management. Using a social constructionist approach and social positioning theory, and semi-structured interviews (narrative and 'elicitation' approaches) with information seekers and HPs, this study draws attention to women's complex information worlds, their engagement with information sources, their independent information seeking and interpretation, the pervasive influence of the internet, the role of intrapersonal sources, and the facilitating roles valued when women gathered information from HPs. Findings highlight the influence of the 'symptom experience'; women's desire to align lived experience with perceived 'normal' experiences; and notions of responsibility engendered by upheavals in conventional medical knowledge. Data analyses demonstrate: construction of menopause-related information was influenced by women's construction of evidence as research, material object, negotiated belief, and lived experience; women positioned themselves as autonomous, collaborative and/or dependent information seekers and decision-makers, and positions were influenced by context and perceived quality of interactions with HPs; a predominant feature of health information behaviour was complementarity, not competition or displacement; and social contexts were critical to knowledge construction. Findings raise new considerations related to KT as an on-going, personal process of social construction, and the contribution of interdisciplinary research: theory from Library and Information Science facilitated investigation of information sources and behaviour, positioning theory brought focus to relational elements, and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework facilitated exploration of KT as a process shaped by evidence, context and facilitation. The study has implications for women's health, health literacy and shared decision-making.

T1  - Three essays on customer chemistry
AN  - 250854967
AB  - The focus of much marketing research for the past two decades has been on the role of consumption in consumers' lives. Relationships with products, brands, and favorite possessions have captured the interest of researchers and practitioners. More recently the concept of brand love has emerged to describe the lengths to which some consumers will go to maintain relationships with certain consumed objects. But is consumer love contained only to favorite brands or might there be different types of love as in interpersonal relationships? This dissertation presents a case for the development of one type of consumer love – customer chemistry, the consumer process of forming a positive, environmentally-derived attachment to a retailer.   Because the concept of customer chemistry is new, this dissertation employs a methodical approach necessary for building theory. Essay One (Chapter Two) explores the reactions of consumers to a select group of retailers. Through analysis of their reactions to various retail servicescapes, the researcher draws conclusions regarding the levels of importance that consumers place on specific elements of the retail experience.   Essay Two (Chapter Three) delineates the bridging laws that allow for theory development. Conclusions from the previous essay inform the creation of a model that describes the customer chemistry process and allows for prediction of specific antecedents and outcomes. The model is tested using structural equation modeling (SEM).   With customer chemistry established empirically, Essay Three (Chapter Four) explores the purpose that customer chemistry serves in consumers' lives. Modified consumer life histories describe customer chemistry in the context of life narratives, suggesting that customer chemistry plays an important role in identity construction. While the concept of consumption serving an identity creation purpose for consumers is not new, the idea that a place (in this case, a retail store) can serve that purpose is unique to this research.    This dissertation argues for a better understanding of consumers' relationships with loved retailers and suggests several avenues for future research. The surface of a broad phenomenon has only been scratched, but important groundwork is laid for the development of a rich stream of research, one that can benefit researchers, practitioners, and consumers.   Keywords. Identity construction, life history, narrative, SEM, retail, consumer behavior.

T1  - Supervision experience and ego development of counseling interns' site supervisors and supervisees' level of ego development and occupational stress
AN  - 305094272
AB  - The primary purposes of this study were (a) to investigate the relationship between counseling interns' site supervisors' experience and training in supervision and their own levels of ego development and (b) to investigate the relationship between supervisors' levels of ego development and the ego functioning and occupational stress of their intern-supervisees. The theoretical framework for this investigation included cognitive developmental models of supervision (e.g., Blocher, 1983; Stoltenberg, 1981), ego development (Loevinger, 1976, 1997) and the Person-Environment Fit theory of occupational stress (French, Rogers, & Cobb, 1974). The findings of this study contribute to an understanding of (a) the levels of ego development and post-degree clinical supervision experiences of internship site supervisors in different areas of counseling specialty; (b) the relationship between social-cognitive developmental levels and levels of perceived occupational stress in counseling interns; and (c) cognitive development theory and counseling supervision.    Ninety-six counseling internship students in three master's level counseling programs accredited by the Council for Accreditation for Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) in Central Florida as well as 58 (73% response rate) of their internship site supervisors participated in the study. The site supervisors completed the Supervisors Experience Questionnaire  (Walter, 2008) and the Washington University Sentence Completion Test—Form 81 (WUSCT; Hy & Loevinger, 1996). The participating counseling internship students completed a demographics questionnaire, the WUSCT—Form 81, and the Occupational Stress Inventory – Revised (OSI-R; Osipow, 1998). The statistical procedures used to analyze the data included chi-square, ANOVA, simultaneous multiple regression, and MANOVA procedures.    The primary research hypotheses for the study were (1) that formal training in supervision and participation in post-graduate clinical supervision would predict supervisor ego development and (2) that supervisor ego development would predict supervisee ego development and occupational stress levels; these were not supported for these data. However, the results identified statistically significant relationships between supervisor participation in post-graduate clinical supervision and area of counseling specialty, with school counselor supervisors less likely to have participated in supervision than other supervisors. Additionally, the findings identified a negative correlation between interns' levels of perceived occupational stress and their ego development levels (14.6% of the variance explained), as well as a negative correlation between interns' levels of satisfaction with their internship site supervision and their levels of occupational stress (40% of the variance explained). The data from this investigation suggested that school counseling interns experienced higher levels of occupational stress due to occupational roles and lower levels of personal resources than interns in other counseling tracks, with the track accounting for 25.6% of the variance in the occupational stress levels. Implications for counseling supervisors and counselor educators are presented, along with areas for future investigation.

T1  - College student's perceptions of public service anouncements across broadcast, social, and mobile media
AN  - 305077798
AB  - This study examined differences in the perception of Public Service Announcements (PSAs) among traditional-aged college students between those delivered via Internet; mobile broadband devices; and traditional television and radio programming. Many researchers have established the growing use of Internet-based, social, and mobile media use among college students and this has generated a concern among public health practitioners that PSAs delivered through traditional media may not be effectively engaging college students. The study employed correlation analyses of data from a convenience sample of 300 undergraduate students that included 189 female students and 111 male students attending a liberal arts university located in the Midwest to examine relationships between the various types of media employed to deliver PSAs and their perceived engagement stratified by age, gender, class level, ethnicity, perceptions of media attributes, and media preferences. This exploratory inquiry, routed in the confluence of McLuhan's medium as message construct and Kingdon’s public policy formulation model, is intended to broaden understanding of college student perceptions of PSAs and the media used to deliver them. The study found that despite their heavy use of the Internet, college students perceived television to exhibit the highest overall degree of synchronicity between its attributes, PSA delivery prowess, and college student lifestyles which is conducive for elevated levels of PSA engagement. The results from this study can be used by public health practitioners to leverage television's perceived high entertainment and portability attributes to drive social change on issues like HIV/AIDS, gambling, drug abuse, smoking, binge drinking, and sexual promiscuity among college students thus reducing preventable diseases and improving public health.

T1  - A qualitative examination of master's degree level counselors' experiences and development in the first professional year
AN  - 304882005
AB  - This study is a qualitative investigation of master's degree level counselors' perceptions of their experiences and development during their first professional year after graduation. The main research questions of the study are (1) what is the first professional year like for master's degree level counselors?, (a) what are the challenges master's degree level counselors face during the first professional year?, (b) what are master's degree level counselors' perceptions regarding their preparedness for their first professional year?, and (c) what are master's degree level counselors' perceptions regarding their own professional counselor development during their first professional year?   Grounded theory methodology was used for data collection and analysis. Theoretical sampling of participants occurred in order to maximize opportunities to discover variations among concepts and to expand the limits of the research findings until data saturation was reached. Participants were interviewed from a semi-structured phenomenological stance. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed on an on-going basis throughout the study so that themes could be identified and negative cases sought out until data saturation was reached. Steps in analysis involved microanalysis, open coding, axial coding and finally selective coding per Strauss and Corbin's prescribed approach.   The results uncovered a rich model of master's degree level counselor development and experiences in the first professional year whereby aspects of the counselor's existing self interact with current factors that support and challenge the counselor as they attempt to deal with the primary tasks and experiences of the first professional year. The integral aspects of the counselor's existing self were found to include personality, self-awareness, coping styles, and past education and clinical training. The interacting support and challenge factors that emerged fell under three categories: relational, environmental, and educational. The dominant primary tasks and experiences that emerged were: adjusting to realities of the job/field, managing practical aspects, managing wavering confidence, managing emotional aspects of the work, managing independence, and gaining clinical confidence.

T1  - The effects of constructive realism and attachment orientation on the adjustment of university students
AN  - 304860469
AB  - Adaptation to stressful transitions is considered from the perspective of Kellian constructivism and attachment theory. It was hypothesized that: (a) constructive realism (i.e., thinking about both negative and positive future possibilities) should be related with better adjustment during transition to university than positively biased or negatively biased thinking; (b) secure attachment style would buffer transitional stress and change to towards attachment insecurity would be predicted by an unrealistic orientation; (c) constructive realists would use different strategies to prepare for an anticipated stressor, including setting different expectancies of success.    In Study I, first year students at Carleton University (N=143) filled out the Orientation to University Scale (OUS) that was administered in mass testing (N=1294) to test the reliability and validity. Results indicated that the OUS has a good test-retest reliability, convergent validity (regarding to the measures of optimism, defensive pessimism and proactive coping), and discriminant validity (regarding to the measures of impression management and self-deception). Study II conducted in the Winter term (N=341) showed that: (a) realistic orientation can be more adaptive in terms of satisfaction with university than a negatively biased orientation when unexpected adversities strike, but realistic orientation is not significantly more adaptive than a positively biased orientation; (b) decreasing levels of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were associated with higher levels of satisfaction with university and satisfaction with life; and (c) change towards attachment insecurity was partly predicted by a negatively biased orientation to university. Study III (N=54) showed that: (a) positively oriented students tended to perceive higher levels of future performance than realists and they did not alter their perception of past performance after a difficult experimental test; (b) positively oriented students who were instructed to imagine “only success” did not significantly reduce their positive mood after the test.

T1  - Expatriate selection and retention
AN  - 304827038
AB  - A significant amount of research is focusing on attributes beyond knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) since KSAs alone are only sufficient assessments for domestic candidates and are inadequate dimensions for assessing true potential expatriate selection. The "O" in KSAOs is known as the "other characteristics" even-though the creator of the term is unknown. The "O" itself is widely recognized, acknowledged, and used in addition to KSAs by researchers and practitioners in the field. In the odyssey to discover, define, and categorize the "O" dimensions, numerous characteristics have been considered to be included in what is professed to be paramount in the selection of successful expatriates. Among these characteristics, I argue that currently Mocks are too short-term oriented. They need to balance their needs short-term needs to prematurely end expatriate assignments with the need to consider more long-term approaches to developing cross-cultural competencies.    Each of these three characteristics has been thoroughly researched. Among the three characteristics, stable competencies are defined as having the following three dimensions: (a) self-maintenance, (be) relation, and (c) perception. This study explored the significance and paramount roles that the "O" characteristics play in the selection of processes of expatriates. Sixteen retried, current, and potential expatriates, and/or human resources personnel involved in the selection processes were reviewed. Their "O-related" experiences, traits, and opinions were collected through a one-time interview; and common and differentiating themes were identified and analyzed, to better understand the efficacy of "O" characteristics and their relationship to successful expatriate selection.    Based on the experience of the sixteen participants, none of the Mocks uses expatriate-assessment manuals for selecting expatriate candidates and many (14 or 87%) do not even have such manuals. Among the organizations that have but do not use the manual, twelve participants (75%) indicated that the manuals were "not useful." On the other hand, based on the experience of four participants, there is a perceived need for Mocks to strategically assess, utilize, and manage these other characteristics in order to produce successful expatriates. As a result, practical recommendations facilitating the selection of expatriates are provided.

T1  - Leadership perceptions of staff in the context of the hotel industry in China
AN  - 304809230
AB  - Leadership skills are crucial in the hospitality industry, given its intense competition, dynamic environment, service orientation and labour-intensive nature. With increasing globalization and internationalization of the hotel industry, a thorough understanding of expatriate and local hotel staff becomes crucial. Although China's tourism industry has been open since 1978, the industry is still in a state of relative infancy. With accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 and projected to become the world's top tourist destination by 2020, China will continue to need expatriate hotel managers for their expertise and for technology transfer. Because most expatriate assignments involve a managerial/leadership role in a host country, cultural similarities and differences will certainly influence the degree to which leadership is effective. Moreover, grooming future international hospitality leaders to be effective in various contexts is becoming a challenge.    The objective of this study is to explore leadership perceptions of staff in the context of the hotel industry in China. A conceptual model that integrates the "micro" and "macro" contextual constraints on leadership perceptions is adopted for use in this research project. The "micro" aspect uses the leadership prototype approach that describes the match/mismatch of leadership schema between leader/manager and follower/subordinate, which in turn affects the effectiveness of leadership. The "macro" aspect examines the impacts of societal contexts on leadership. This study combines qualitative and quantitative methodologies. It uses 19 interviews in the early stage of the project to explore themes relating to the impacts of various contextual elements on perceptions of leadership. "Professionalism" and "culture" were the two major themes that emerged from this phase of the study. The results were used later for surveys and interpretations. An instrument based on the literature and on qualitative interviews identified 57 leadership attributes, which were refined to 25 for a survey. The sample studied included 82 managers and 219 subordinates from hotels in Beijing. Additionally, a sample of 137 telecommunications staff was studied for comparison with the hotel group.    Four factors emerged from a 16-item solution: professionalism; integrity; masculine/Yang; feminine/Yin. T tests of group comparisons indicated the existence of "industry difference," "level difference" or "national cultural difference" in different dimensions. Both qualitative and quantitative results indicated that "professionalism" as a critical dimension of leadership perception. Implications of the results for leadership training and development were discussed in detail. The small sample of expatriate staff limits the generalization that can be made for this group.    In conclusion, the conceptual framework developed in this study is a useful guide for understanding leadership in the context of China's hotel industry. Most previous research on this subject lacked a theoretical framework or perspective. This study contributes a more holistic understanding by integrating "micro" and "macro" perspectives with the focus of the impacts of various contextual elements. The identification of "Professionalism" as new attribute in the leadership literature is a major contribute the leadership research as well. Also, it contributes to future training/development of international hospitality leaders and local staff by increasing the awareness of leadership perceptions in various contexts of the rapidly-globalizing hotel industry.

T1  - A comparative analysis of Tourism Destination Image and Product -Country Image
AN  - 304664896
AB  - This study advances place image theory through research that combines knowledge from the two fields of marketing that have dealt most extensively with place image: Tourism Destination Image (TDI) — the effects of beliefs, ideas, and impressions that a person has of a destination; and, Product-Country Image (PCI) — the effects of "place" image on buyer attitudes toward products from various origins. Although the focus of both fields is place image, each has developed independently of the other, and notwithstanding their common object of interest, there has been no systematic research that fully combines the two perspectives. Therefore this comparative analysis of TDI and PCI represents the first ever in-depth cross-fertilization of ideas between these two significant fields of research.   To explore the potential relationships between cognitive and affective dimensions of place, and tourism and product beliefs and behaviours, a theoretical model is developed by merging research and knowledge from both fields. The resulting Integrated Model of Place Image (IMPI) incorporates a mix of TDI and PCI image measures, comprising eight constructs and 26 variables, that establish a framework for the analysis of any place of interest.   The Integrated Model is tested using consumer survey data from South Korea (n=349) and Canada (n=307), to compare image measures of these two countries, the U.S., Australia and Japan, in a 2x4 analysis using Structural Equation Modeling. The results reveal that cognitive country image has greater influence on product factors, affective country image has greater influence on destination factors, and familiarity only influences product beliefs and behaviours. Additionally, consumer beliefs exhibit a strong cross-over effect, particularly in the direction from product beliefs to destination receptivity. The influence of destination beliefs on receptivity to that country's products, though weaker, is also evident.   The results contribute to both the theoretical foundations, and practical analysis of place image. For researchers, the results shed much light on the theories postulated in the conceptual model. The relationships between the core constructs of image, beliefs and behaviours are identified, as are new relationships between product and tourism constructs, along with their relative strengths. For practitioners, the model dynamics raise important issues. The IMPI identifies which image-related variables are important, and which are not, and how consumers evaluate products and destinations. Supported by empirical results, the IMPI is presented for the future study of TDI and PCI.

T1  - Writing in science: Exploring teachers' and students' views of the nature of science in language enriched environments
AN  - 304342266
AB  - Writing in science can be used to address some of the issues relevant to contemporary scientific literacy, such as the nature of science, which describes the scientific enterprise for science education. This has implications for the kinds of writing tasks students should attempt in the classroom, and for how students should understand the rationale and claims of these tasks. While scientific writing may train the mind to think scientifically in a disciplined and structured way thus encouraging students to gain access to the public domain of scientific knowledge, the counter-argument is that students need to be able to express their thoughts freely in their own language. Writing activities must aim to promote philosophical and epistemological views of science that accurately portray contemporary science.    This mixed-methods case study explored language-enriched environments, in this case, secondary science classrooms with a focus on teacher-developed activities, involving diversified writing styles, that were directly linked to the science curriculum. The research foci included: teachers' implementation of these activities in their classrooms; how the activities reflected the teachers' nature of science views; common attributes between students' views of science and how they represented science in their writings; and if, and how the activities influenced students' nature of science views. Teachers' and students' views of writing and the nature of science are illustrated through pre-and post-questionnaire responses; interviews; student work; and classroom observations. Results indicated that diversified writing activities have the potential to accurately portray science to students, personalize learning in science, improve students' overall attitude towards science, and enhance scientific literacy through learning science, learning about science, and doing science. Further research is necessary to develop an understanding of whether the choice of genre has an influence on meaning construction and understanding in science. Finally, this study concluded that the relationship between students' views of the nature of science and writing in science is complex and is dependent on several factors including the teachers' influence and attitude towards student writing in science.

T1  - A case study of an in-service professional development model on bilingual deaf education: Changes in teachers' stated beliefs and classroom practices
AN  - 912738990
AB  - Teachers hold beliefs that influence the decisions they make in their classrooms. Professional development models can have an impact on teachers' beliefs when they focus on making those beliefs explicit and provide alternative beliefs and practices for teachers to explore. This interpretative case study documents the implementation of an ASL/English Bilingual Professional Development (AEBPD). It investigates the changes in beliefs about language learning, teaching, and acquisition experienced by three teachers who participated in it over the course of two years. The study also explores changes in the participants' patterns of practice and analyzes classroom observations to establish the relationship between beliefs and classroom practice.    Methods of data collections included semi-structured interviews, participant observations, guided reflections, and document review. Data were organized, coded, and analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Case records were created to document recurring themes, categories and contrasts. Individual case studies were written following triangulation of recurring themes across all data sources. Triangulation also included a peer debriefer and members' check. Final analysis yielded the participants' personal constructs and across-case themes.    Findings indicate that each participant became aware of their beliefs about language teaching, learning, and acquisition and each experienced changes which were closely tied to the areas in which they held more significant beliefs. These areas included: a) student characteristics; b) their role as teachers of diverse Deaf learners; c) personal experiences as bilingual individuals; d) professional training; e) parent involvement; and f) the role of reflection in the implementation of a bilingual approach with Deaf learners. All participants made changes to their practice and those changes were in close alignment with their stated beliefs. The across-case findings illustrate the understanding about bilingual education for Deaf children that the participants gained as a result of the training. The beliefs that were common to all participants included: a) American Sign Language (ASL) is the foundation; b) languages must be separated; c) balanced use of language should be planned; d) social and academic language functions must be developed for both languages; e) ASL and English should be linked through bilingual strategies; and f) teachers have critical roles in a bilingual Deaf classroom. The significance of these beliefs is that they align with and reflect AEBPD's main principles and goals.

T1  - The relationship between nurses' environmental and psychological empowerment on psychological strain in critical care nursing work environments
AN  - 304833195
AB  - The present study examines the relationship between nurses' environmental and psychological empowerment on psychological strain in critical care nursing work environments. Quality of medical care is to a great extent dependent upon the mental well being of health care professionals. Numerous studies have found that workplace stressors that result in psychological strain in critical care nursing environments are significant and associated with a negative impact on performance. Employee empowerment may help to determine workplace factors that help nurses cope with psychological strain. Randolph, Blanchard (1997) and Spreitzer (1995) proposed theories of empowerment that show promise for developing management strategies that enhance organizational success and that they are correlated with reduced psychological strain. The problem is that few studies use empowerment with nurses in a critical care environment. A t-test revealed a significant difference between nurses that had high levels of empowerment and those with low levels empowerment with regard to strain. Additionally, overall empowerment accounted for 28% of the variance in strain and clear structures and team accountability were significant predictors of strain.

T1  - A case study of caring in nursing education
AN  - 304832091
AB  - The purpose of this case study was to describe a curriculum that teaches caring in the formal, overt curriculum, that is, where caring has been explicitly operationalized in the content and learning experiences of students. Faculty and student perceptions regarding ways of teaching and learning caring were explored and the lived experiences of the students within the caring curriculum described. The focus of this study was to describe how students learn caring during their nursing education. This qualitative case study described one college of nursing in their efforts to teach caring within the context of nursing. The curricular documents were reviewed and a document analysis was done to explain how caring was threaded throughout the formal written curriculum. Caring was threaded throughout the curriculum and was made manifest in every nursing course. Interviews were conducted with 22 faculty and 20 students to describe how the faculty teach caring and how the students learn caring in this curriculum. The research participants were students and faculty involved with the three years of required nursing courses. The teaching of caring in this curriculum was based on Watson's caring theory and the carative factors. Faculty provided a supportive, caring learning environment and used both classroom and clinical teaching strategies to teach caring within the context of nursing. Faculty and students link caring with holism, critical thinking, and the nursing process. Students explain how they learn caring theory first in the classroom and then learn how to implement caring behaviors and the carative factors in their clinical practice. The students' ability to articulate caring in the role of the nurse increased with each year of study. Students and faculty in this curriculum believed that the role modeling of caring was significant in the teaching and learning of caring. Giving voice to the caring in the overt curriculum was important for the students as they learned, discussed and reflected on their caring experiences.

T1  - Taking the child to work: The relationship of adult attachment styles and implicit leadership theories in organizational settings
AN  - 304714860
AB  - Individuals hold enduring beliefs and mental models of traits required for one to be considered and classified as a leader. Attachment theory states that mental models originate from early life experiences with parents and represent a person’s entrenched strategies of relating. Identifying and categorizing a target as leader, then, is representative of the way attachment patterns with parents are re-experienced in the present. This study investigated Keller’s (2003) proposition that follower attachment style will influence the characteristics in the follower’s mental representation of a leader. Using Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, and Wall’s (1978) taxonomy of attachment styles (secure, anxious, and avoidant), this study empirically examined the relationship of the follower characteristic of attachment style and the implicitly held theories of leadership along Offermann, Kennedy, and Wirtz’ (1994) eight dimensions of leader traits. A significant multivariate effect was found across attachment styles, supporting the theory that adult attachment styles have an effect on implicit leadership theories. However, when controlling for situational and demographic variables, no significant multivariate differences occurred among attachment styles with covariates of liking of current leader and level of education overcoming the effect of attachment style in affecting preferred leader traits. This study adds to the understanding of implicit leadership theories as Hall and Lord (1995) supposed that the self serves as a significant interpretive structure guiding leadership sensemaking.

T1  - The impact of sense of coherence and spirituality on perceived stress and quality of life in persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
AN  - 305320649
AB  - The study aim was to investigate the relationship between sense of coherence (SOC) and spirituality and their impact on perceptions of stress and quality of life (QOL) in persons with chronic illness such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Sense of coherence, from Antonovsky's Salutogenic Health Model, is a global outlook that perceives the world as predictable, meaningful and manageable. With spirituality, SOC allows one to recognize and utilize resources, relieving stress and improving QOL.    Questionnaires were mailed to non-hospitalized patients with COPD (N = 181). Instrumentation consisted of Antonovsky's Orientation to Life Questionnaire, Piedmont's Spiritual Transcendence Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, Ferrans and Powers' Quality of Life Index (Pulmonary Version) and a study specific demographic information sheet. Symptom severity was participant rated on a Likert-type scale for shortness of breath (SOB) and ability to function, and confirmed by pulmonary function tests (PFT) from participant medical records.    Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, multiple regressions and ANOVA. Persons with high SOC and spirituality scores had lower stress scores (r = -0.687, p > 0.01; r = -0.308, p > 0.01) and higher QOL ratings (r = 0.691, p > 0.01; r = 0.295, p > 0.01). There was a positive correlation between SOC and spirituality (r = 0.271, p > 0.01). Sense of coherence was associated with lower subjective symptom severity (SOB and impaired function) scores (-0.356, p > 0.01; -0.302, p > 0.01), but neither SOC nor spirituality related significantly to objective PFT scores. Income and age contributed significantly to QOL. When SOC, spirituality and stress scores were regressed against QOL, SOC (Beta 0.437) and perceived stress (Beta -0.372) explained 55.4% of the variance. Sense of coherence and spirituality have a moderating effect on stress and a positive effect on quality of life. The large proportion of variance explained in the regression models indicates the importance of psychosocial factors in the patient's cognitive interpretation of illness.

T1  - The moderating effects of clinician cognitive complexity on the accuracy of neuropsychological clinical judgments for Hispanic patients
AN  - 305346768
AB  - This analogue study examined the role of cognitive complexity, defined as "the capacity to construe behavior in a multidimensional way" (Bieri, Atkins, Briar, Leaman, Miller, & Tripodi, 1966, p. 185), as a moderating variable in neuropsychologists' clinical judgments. Varying the ethnicity of a case vignette (Hispanic vs. Anglo), clinicians were asked to provide information regarding their opinions about the patient's premorbid IQ, the presence of impairment, primary diagnosis, and level of confidence regarding these judgments. The opinions of three expert judges, clinicians who have extensive practical and research experience in the field, were used as the criterion measure against which accuracy was measured.    A total of 300 questionnaires were mailed out to doctoral level psychologists, evenly distributed between randomly selected members of the American Psychological Association, Division 40, and the National Academy of Neuropsychologists (NAN).    The final sample consisted of a total of 47 participants. Inclusion criteria included having completed a doctorate and having performed a neuropsychological evaluation in the past year. Of the sample, 68.1% (n = 32) were male and 31.9% (n = 15) were female. The clinicians in the final sample had a mean age of 49.7 (SD = 9.24).    As expected, the final results revealed that clinicians had much more difficulty accurately diagnosing the Hispanic (38%) than the Anglo vignette (71%). However, contrary to the study's hypothesis, cognitive complexity did not play a moderating role in clinicians' accuracy of clinical judgments or confidence in their judgments. Clinicians did not evidence signs of subtle bias, as evidenced by identical ratings of premorbid IQ for both vignettes. However, when compared to the other participants, clinicians obtained from the NAN mailing list sample evidenced signs of obvious bias as defined by their tendency to rate the Hispanic vignette as more likely to be indicative of malingering. Furthermore, clinicians overall seemed to be more confident in their clinical judgments of malingering for the Hispanic than the Anglo client. These findings raise concerns about clinical practice with patients of Hispanic background and point to the need for additional research to help clarify the factors that contribute to clinical judgment heuristics.

T1  - Examining factors influencing offshore outsourcing decisions
AN  - 305002229
AB  - The Gartner Group recently predicted that offshore outsourcing will become a major part of an organization's long-term IT sourcing strategy. Others organizations such as Global Insight, Inc. and DiamondCluster have also projected a rapid development rate for offshore outsourcing. These organizations cite lower labor cost, better service quality, and an overall better strategic fit as major benefits of offshore outsourcing. However, these benefits may be offset by recent attention in the media as to its risk and potential backlash, thus making offshore outsourcing decisions challenging to organizations.    Even though an abundance of research has studied various aspects of domestic outsourcing decision-making, the lessons learned cannot necessarily be applied directly to offshore outsourcing due to its unique context of trading across national borders. Offshore outsourcing encompasses the complexity of foreign national environments and international environments absent in domestic outsourcing. The potential interplay of these environments complicates offshore outsourcing decision-making and thus highlights the need to address the relative lack of research in this area. This is accomplished in this study using a two-phase design. Phase 1 involved 18 decision-makers participated in a card sorting exercise aimed at grouping a list of factors into different categories (i.e., clusters). Using hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling, eight orthogonal clusters emerged: overall IT cost savings, competitive benefits, the offshore vendor's business environment, the U.S. business environment, organizational compatibility, future IT absorptive capacity, subjective norm, and the offshore vendor's reputation. These clusters were treated as factors and were mapped onto the Theory of Planned Behavior in Phase 2. A survey questionnaire was then developed based on the factors.    A total of 139 IT executives participated in an online survey in Phase 2. The results show that the factors from the Theory of Planned Behavior are strong predictors of decision-makers' intention to send IT jobs offshore. Overall IT cost saving, the offshore vendor's reputation, and the U.S. business environment are also significantly related to the intention to outsource offshore. Contrary to findings in the domestic outsourcing literature, competitive benefits and absorptive capacity do not impact the intention to outsource offshore.

T1  - Creating organizational knowledge during transformational change: A multi -site case study using an action theory approach
AN  - 305183242
AB  - This study sought to understand the dynamic social process of creating organizational knowledge during transformational change through understanding the nature of a firm's knowledge structure concerning organizational change. To best understand how firms know what, where, when, why, and how to change, the researcher used mixed methodologies to gather real-time data to include qualitative and quantitative strategies such as: the Organizational Action Survey (Johnson, 1998) using a cross-section representation; focus group storyboarding using emerging pragmatic theory with informed sources who had both strategic and operational perspectives of the firm; interviews with top management team members; observations of planning meetings and daily routines; and document review of stated strategic direction and transformational effort plans. The methods were replicated in two firms in different industries undergoing change to maximize variation and gain insight into the phenomenon under study.    The study was based on the premise that the firm's ability to create new knowledge is a prerequisite for organizational transformation (Hedberg, 1981; Lundberg, 1989; Nonaka, 1991b; Schwandt, 1997b); and that knowledge creation is a result of the recursive social process (Giddens, 1990; Schwandt, 1997b) in which there is a dynamic interaction between the social actions of human collective and the cognitive structures that guide those actions. Using a social action theory approach that allowed for a comprehensive examination of the social processes involved at the collective level, the study was able to meet its objectives of (1) describing the nature of firm-level knowledge structure concerning organizational change; (2) examining patterns of actions at the firm-level during a transformational change effort; and (3) advancing the theoretical understanding by linking collective action, knowledge structures, and creation of knowledge through empirical grounding.    There were seven primary characteristics that represent the nature of knowledge structure concerning organizational change: (1) internally focused knowledge structure that was preoccupied with production; (2) a dominant core that suppressed rather than evoked inquiry; (3) tightly coupled elements that contributed to the reduction of equivocality and inquiry; (4) action orientation focused on performing rather than learning; (5) structuring actions that reflected an imbalance of requisite variety and equifinality; (6) default to history/culture elements in response to threatening conditions in external environment; and (7) skeptical perspective that viewed change as an outcome rather than an opportunity perspective that viewed change as an ongoing means to enhance adaptive capacity.    In general, the knowledge structure was too simple given the complexity of their external environment. The focus was on present rather than future action, performing rather than learning, and driven by prevailing norms of resistance. The knowledge structure lacked capacity to create knowledge about its change process, and in turn reinforced the performing orientation at the expense of generating new goal reference knowledge about plausible future actions. Implications and recommendations for future research included longitudinal comparative case studies using mix methodologies with real-time data to allow for the tracking of altering knowledge structures during periods of punctuated and incremental change. Additionally, continued work with multi-level theories derived from cross-disciplines that include both the macro and micro level allowed for a more comprehensive understanding to collective knowledge structures.

T1  - The influence of the institutional field on strategic issue interpretation by biotechnology executives
AN  - 305227045
AB  - An organization's institutional field—encompassing suppliers, consumers, regulatory agencies and competitors, among others—likely influences its executives' interpretations of key issues. These issue interpretations by managers influence the decisions they make and thereby affect business strategies, organizational operations, and ultimately firm performance.    An additional element in understanding executive issue interpretation is the relationship of those interpretations to subsequent organizational actions. Although executives may perceive issues in a similar manner and operate within the same institutional field, not all executives will respond in the same manner to identical issues. Understanding the degree of influence of the institutional field on an individual executive's cognitive processes may provide additional explanation of how executives interpret opportunities and threats for their organizations and of the actions they take to deal with these issues.    This research addresses two related questions. How does the institutional field affect executives' perceptions of regulatory actions as opportunities or threats for their firms? How do these perceptions relate to planned organizational actions?    To test these relationships, the author conducted a national mail survey of top executives in the biotechnology industry with responses from 111 (10%). Results of regression analysis suggest that the relationship between both the external threat and the perception of control problems with the threat and future plans for additional products is moderated by the prior patent success for the organization. The findings support prior research on prospect theory and suggest that future organizational risk assessments are influenced by the lack of prior success. Executives are willing to take more risk and invest in more new products when they have fewer successes in obtaining patents.    In addition, the author found that executives find issues to be more controllable when they perceive there is strong support from local industry groups, venture capitalists, and liaisons from educational institutions. This finding suggests that there is variance in the institutional field for biotechnology companies. Awareness and utilization of the institutional field may assist companies in addressing important industry issues.

T1  - The properties of sensemaking: A case study of meaning development during organizational change
AN  - 305575848
AB  - The purpose of this qualitative case study was to test Weick's (1995) framework for sensemaking. The framework has seven “properties”: it is (1) grounded in identity construction, (2) retrospective, (3) enactive of sensible environments, (4) social, (5) ongoing, (6) focused on and by extracted cues, and (7) driven by plausibility rather than accuracy. While the framework has a vast theoretical foundation and has been applied in a small number of research projects, it had never been subjected to an in situ test during ongoing organizational change.    Participants for the study were selected from a subunit of a large federal agency in the Washington, D.C. area that was implementing a new compensation plan for its employees. The 10 participants included managers, nonmanagers, men, and women. Two participants were members of a minority group. Data were gathered through two sets of individual interviews with study participants and through a focus group in which the participants used an automated group interaction software package. The first set of individual interviews used a standard question-and-answer protocol; the second set used a “storytelling” protocol. The focus group session, which used a nine-question protocol, allowed participants to see and react to each other's comments without knowing who was generating which responses. Archival data also were collected to provide a better understanding of the organizational culture of the agency and the context in which the change was taking place. Interview and focus group data were coded and analyzed using a text analysis software package.    The results of the study confirmed evidence of five sensemaking properties: social, identity, retrospective, cues, and plausible vs. accurate. A potential sensemaking property, schemata, emerged from the analysis, and the final chapter of the study presents an argument for including it in Weick's framework. A rationale is offered to explain the lack of supporting data for the ongoing and enactive properties. The study reinforces the usefulness of Weick's framework as a tool for managing organizational change and highlights the need for additional knowledge concerning linkages between the sensemaking properties and the role of emotion vis-a-vis Weick's framework.

T1  - An empirical study of the relationship between organizational controls, capabilities, and performance: The management of knowledge
AN  - 287834678
AB  - This dissertation examines how differing control mechanisms within a firm affect its ability to form unique capabilities, and ultimately, performance. A model is developed and tested that shows (a) how various control systems differentially affect the flow of distinct types of knowledge within the firm and (b) how these different types of knowledge affect the ability to develop specific capabilities and achieve particular levels of performance. In particular, the differential effect that bureaucratic and clan control mechanisms have on tacit, diverse, process-related and outcome-related knowledge is examined. The types of performance examined relate to quality and productivity. This research used a multifaceted methodology to examine the control mechanisms, knowledge management and performance within a given firm. The data is collected from an auto supplier, which utilizes the two forms of control under investigation. In this regard, the methodology employed was a quasi-experiment in a real-world setting. Data regarding the control configuration in place was collected from various levels of management within the plant. In addition, 220 line workers participated in a card sorting technique to capture the different types of knowledge. Performance data for 10 departments over a three-year period was also collected. The results show support for the model and indicate that the use of clan controls is associated with significantly higher amounts of shared tacit and diverse knowledge than with bureaucratic controls. In addition, a larger amount of shared process-related knowledge is associated with higher levels of productivity and more shared outcome-related knowledge is associated with higher levels of quality. This research has been able to contribute to the literature on controls and the knowledge-based view by highlighting how an examination of the control system allows one to infer the type of knowledge emphasized in the firm and thus, the type of capabilities that can be developed.

T1  - The impact of service providers' emotional displays on service evaluation: Evidence of emotional contagion
AN  - 304723021
AB  - The present work begins with an exhaustive and comparative review of the emotions literature in psychology and in sociology. In Chapter Six, a model of the emotion system of the service encounter is developed. In part, it represents a conceptualization and a substantial and substantive extension of Hochschild's (1983a) work on emotional labor. The model not only accounts for the emotional reactions of consumers to the affective displays of service providers but provides an interdisciplinary perspective on emotion. Accordingly, we draw on elements from cognitive and somatic perspectives in psychology, Hochschild's (1983a) interactional theory, the views of other social constructivists, purist sociological perspectives, and on perspectives from communication studies in an attempt to account for the multilevel emotional dynamics which occur in the service encounter. It becomes evident that emotions are not simply intrapersonal states but that they are also social or interpersonal phenomena. It is also stressed that the consumer's and service provider's emotion processes involve different determinants. Importantly, it is suggested that cognitive appraisal theories do not provide the only general mechanism which may account for consumer emotion in the service encounter. Alternatively, primitive emotional contagion  rests on somatic theories of emotion. Its underlying mechanism is essentially pre-attentive (unconscious) and thus does not imply the type of mental calculus which is suggested by appraisal theorists as a determinant of emotion. At a theoretical level, primitive emotional contagion appears to better account for emotion in a dynamic and interactive manner than do cognitive theories which essentially represent stimulus-response models. It also represents a compelling explanation for mutual entrainment, synchrony, rapport, and matched emotional states in interaction. On the other hand, cognitive appraisal theories appear to provide a mechanism for consumer emotion after the occurrence of failure in a component of service. Next, an experimental study is conducted to test a variety of hypotheses based on the proposed conceptual model and the services evaluation literature. Results indicate that the interaction between the valence of a service provider's emotional displays and the social context of these displays does have a significant effect on various evaluation factors including service quality dimensions, satisfaction, and behavioral intent.

T1  - Investigating the antecedents of pre-operative expectations and their relation to post-operative satisfaction in elective surgeries
AN  - 251233583
AB  - Customer Satisfaction is different from other health care business indicators because it represents the consumer's subjective perception of the quality of the health care experience. Some argue that cost and quality are the driving factors that dictate which health care facilities will win the competitive game. They say that those with low cost and high quality will win. All those who hold that philosophy, consider this question: What happens when a low-cost, high quality health care experience falls short on Customer Satisfaction expectations? The answer is that the consumer, whether patient or physician, will not be back but will find another physician to help them or another hospital to use.    Health care professionals have traditionally measured the quality of their services by evaluating the structural characteristics and process functions of the care they delivered. In this decade, the assessment of quality has shifted to patient outcomes (Bauman, 1991). The patient's perspective of what constitutes quality is likely to differ from the health care professionals' (Ervin, Walcott-McQuigg, Chen and Upshaw, 1992). Patient satisfaction is not only one of the desired outcomes of care; it is essential for attracting patients in the highly competitive health care environment (Ludwig-Beymer, et. al., 1993).    What set of variables is predictive of patients' satisfaction is yet to be demonstrated (Bond and Thomas, 1992). This stems from the fact that the concept of satisfaction has not been adequately studied to isolate the predictive variables. The lack of knowledge of determinants of patient satisfaction stimulated the initiative of this research endeavor.    The purpose of the research was (1) To identify the factors that patients use to reach a decision before undergoing the LASIK surgery. (2) To find out if patients have gathered enough information prior to the surgical procedure and the importance (weights) attached to each source of information in the decision making process. (3) To measure the extent of satisfaction that the patient achieves by undergoing the surgical procedure. (4) To compare the relationship between information gathered prior to surgery and the satisfaction obtained after the surgery.    The findings of the study were based on a study of patients who had recently undergone the LASIK surgery (an elective eye-surgery for correction of vision). The sample of 137 respondents seemed to rely more heavily on their prior expectations for information, rather than their friends and family or their physician. In general, the patients evaluated satisfaction based on the perceived performance and outcome of the surgery rather than information satisfaction. The patients indicated that there was a significant improvement in their health, after the surgery. However, their expectations about how their vision would be after 30 days from surgery were lower after surgery as compared to before the surgery.

T1  - Nurse educators' experience of their jobs in a diploma nursing programme at a college of applied arts and technology
AN  - 304662273
AB  - Nurse educators who teach student nurses create and perpetuate the professional culture of nursing, many in diploma programmes in the Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology of Ontario. Yet, few studies have explored how these nurse educators experience their work. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to understand and describe the experience of community college nurse educators in their jobs. A purposeful sample of seven nurse educators from a community college in Southern Ontario participated in in-depth interviews averaging two hours in length. Using hermeneutic interpretive analysis, the researcher identified five themes: “feeling devalued/existing in the margins”; “submitting reticently”; “bowing to the ‘status quo’/conflicting with others”; “oppressed group behaviour”; and “finding positive meaning”. Findings illuminated the holistic experience of teaching nursing as one of “finding positive meaning” within an environment of oppressed group behaviour. The findings of this study raise more questions than answers, however, the insights gained afford all nurses the opportunity for critical reflection, thereby promoting positive gains with regard to the status of the profession of nursing.

T1  - L'influence du stress psychologique sur la glycémie chez des individus souffrant de diabete de type 2: Le rôle de l'obésité
AN  - 304653817
AB  - La présente thèse s'intéresse à l'influence du stress psychologique quotidien sur la glycémie chez des individus atteints de diabète de type 2 et propose deux études qui vérifient le rôle de l'obésité dans ce phénomène. La première étude compare la réponse glycémique d'individus obèses et non-obèses atteints de diabète de type 2 à un stresseur de laboratoire. La deuxième étude utilise la modélisation par fonction de transfert pour vérifier l'existence de relations causales entre les niveaux quotidiens de stress et de glycémie en milieu naturel. Aucun changement significatif de glycémie n'a été obtenu dans la première étude. Une relation contemporaine significative, mais non causale, a été obtenue chez deux des quinze participants de la seconde étude. Il est conclu que le stress psychologique tel que mesuré dans ces études, n'influence pas la glycémie à court terme chez des individus obèses ou non-obèses atteints de diabète de type 2.

T1  - Self as role model in health promotion: Development of an empirical instrument
AN  - 304592454
AB  - Historically, nurses have been regarded as role models of health promotion. The paradigmatic shift in health care from an emphasis on illness care to health promotion, coupled with changing conceptions of health promotion, has had an impact on nursing and its scope of practice in health promotion. Yet, the expectation for nurses to be health-promoting exemplars has not changed and has taken on the appearance of a role. To date, the few research studies which have examined nurses as health promoting role models have conceptualized and measured the construct in terms of compliance with health-related behaviors. However, indirect, non-standardized self-report measures of lifestyle practices and behaviors do not reflect the evolution which has taken place in health promotion. As health promotion has evolved from a lifestyle focus to become a broad, multi-dimensional concept, the validity of existing instruments has become questionable. Hence, the purpose of this study, was to conceptualize the construct, to develop a valid and reliable instrument based on this conceptualization and to conduct preliminary testing of the instrument's psychometric properties.    Development and testing of the Self as Role Model in Health Promotion Scale (SARMHEP) proceeded through a three-phase process. Phase one, the theoretical phase, culminated in the conceptual schema used to guide instrument development. The three major theoretical dimensions constituting the conceptual schema, ‘meaning of role model’, ‘passive self-definition’, and ‘active self-definition’, were translated into empirical indicators in phase two, the operationalization phase. In phase three, the psychometric testing phase, the finalized 95-item instrument and a background questionnaire were distributed to nurse educators and nurses in practice. Beginning evidence for the construct validity and internal consistency reliability of the SARMHEP emerged. Content validity, obtained through expert review, was quantified at .90. A series of exploratory factor analyses elicited a final 57-item, five-factor solution which accounted for 44% of the variance and approximated the theoretical dimensions that guided the SARMHEP's development. Relationships between the total scale/subscale scores and single item global role model self-rating were not in the predicted direction to support construct validity of the scale. Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was .91 and for the five sub-scales ranged from .73 to .92.    The SARMHEP scale has significant applications in the educational, professional socialization, and clinical practice arenas. The instrument may be used to determine how nurses' perceptions of themselves as role models in health promotion influence their own personal health practices and to study the impact of such self-perceptions on role performance in other areas of health promotion, such as teaching and counselling.

T1  - Time and personal action: Tenses and aspects of project pursuit
AN  - 304586810
AB  - In addition to identifying empirically the value of using grammaticalized meaning as a guide to research in personality, this dissertation attempts to answer the question: ‘Which dimensions of time, broadly construed, appear most central to our actions and our well-being and the links between the two?’ As the quintessential carrier of meaning relating to action and time, the verbal phrase is argued to be the key unit of analysis in conative psychology and three grammatical categories associated with the verbal phrase are explored in the context of well being: action character (Aktionsart ), tense, and aspect.    Action character differences explored in study 1 were evident at the level of single personal action constructs (enjoyment/stress) and at the individual level (subjective well-being). Personal projects (Little, 1983) phrased as activities (non-goal oriented, durative action) are generally experienced as more enjoyable and less stressful, although the domain of action (e.g. academic, social) was found to interact with this association. At the level of the individual, non goal-oriented individuals show highest well-being when enjoying their projects, while goal-oriented individuals show highest well-being when their projects are not overly stressful.    In study 2, tense was explored in two age-defined samples. Temporal attitude, orientation and integration emerge as the strongest predictors of well-being and depression, while those temporal variables that focus solely on future time perspective were less central. Particularly powerful in predicting well-being is the attitude one has toward self in the now, while those with a tendency to think more about the past and a desire to ‘forget’ about the future tend more towards depression. Overall, it is argued that all tenses must be considered in the context of action and well-being, particularly the present, which serves as a final common pathway for past experience to guide future planning which, in turn, directs current action.    Study 3 linked the imperfective and perfective aspects of the verb with a fundamental dichotomy in the way in which we experience action, that is, both in time and outside of time. Self-reported cognitive and affective correlates of phenomenologically timeless projects were compared with Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow and found to be more reflective of a much more common albeit not necessarily as ‘optimal’ an experience, parachronicity. Although evidence emerged at a project level that timeless action is experienced more positively, a tendency towards parachronicity at the individual level is associated with self-reported meaning in life. Methodological problems and future research directions are discussed.    Although the tense (past, present and future) variables account for the greatest variability in well being, both action character and aspectual perspectives offer a much more nuanced understanding of the interaction of time and action, an understanding which does appear to be enhanced by considering the two together along grammatical parameters. Future directions for research are also outlined.

T1  - The complex process of planned organizational change: Developing a model of knowledge, activity, and communication networks
AN  - 304581571
AB  - Although planned organizational change is a favorite topic for scholars, practitioners, and writers of popular management books, there is much about this complex process that is not well understood. A superior explanation of organizational change, however, should not differ dramatically from an explanation of organizational stability, and should describe the processes by which organizational modifications occur in depth. Toward this end, a Parallel Distributed Processing model of organizational activity dissipation is proposed in this study, and it inspires six research questions regarding individual and collective knowledge structures, activity patterns, network participation, and organizational learning. These research questions were examined through a longitudinal, multi-method case study of a municipal government and its planned change. The study finds that individual and collective knowledge structures for the planned change shifted over time to reflect important events and relationships between workgroups, a shift that created greater divergence between members' views over time. Moreover, individuals' positions in the collective knowledge structure were associated with communication network participation and patterns of activity, though these relationships were contingent on contextual features and events. Finally, the success of the division's planned change was ambiguously successful for members, which created contradictory influences on system adaptation. These results have implications for the practice of planned change, as well as for theory and research on communication networks, managerial and organizational cognition, organizational change, organizational learning, and the Parallel Distributed Processing model.

T1  - Bridging two solitudes: An examination of shared understanding between information systems and line executives
AN  - 304571947
AB  - This dissertation research was undertaken to examine the critical set of information technology (IT)-related issues that senior executives need to have a shared understanding of, for IT to be deployed successfully within their organizations. This examination focused on the executive dyad as the unit of analysis. The sample was drawn from large retail organizations operating in North America.    The specific goals of the research were to: (1) Define the critical set of IT-related issues that senior executives need to have a shared understanding of. (2) Create an instrument capable of reliably and validly assessing IT-related shared understanding at the executive level. (3) Conduct a preliminary test of a research model linking shared understanding to antecedent factors and success in deploying IT.    The research program consisted of two phases. In Phase 1, eight in-depth case studies were conducted. In total, 33 senior executives were interviewed, and asked to discuss their views on shared understanding of IT issues at the executive level—the specific issues, the factors that create it, and its relationship to success in deploying IT. The findings from the first phase were used to refine a preliminary research model and construct an instrument to measure shared understanding. Both were tested in Phase 2.    Phase 2 was a survey based research approach, with an embedded case-scenario approach for measuring shared understanding. A total of 50 executive level dyads were examined in order to assess the refined research model, and test the shared understanding instrument. Significant outcomes from the research program were: (1) Definition of Shared Understanding at the Executive Level—key issues identified; confirmation of four dimensional construct; (2) Measurement of shared understanding—valid and reliable instrument created; case-scenario approach utilized; support found for modeling congruence as interaction; (3) Preliminary test of the research model—a strong and positive relationship between shared understanding and success in deploying IT was found; Tolerance for Ambiguity, Locus of Control, Previous Success with IT, and Level of Education found to be predictors of level of shared understanding.

T1  - Therapeutic intimacy: The lived experience of the oncology nurse
AN  - 304538954
AB  - Kadner (1994) defines therapeutic intimacy as "a confiding relationship between two people, a self-disclosure of personal information with the expectation of understanding and acceptance (consisting of) trust, closeness, self-disclosure and reciprocity." The lived experience of oncology nurses who experience deep connected relationships with patients was explored in this study in an attempt to better describe the phenomenon, therapeutic intimacy.    Significant statements created formulated meanings (sub-themes) which became organized around 15 themes. The themes formed several theme clusters. Finally, the theme clusters developed into a recognizable pattern of three categories, that helped to describe the experience of therapeutic intimacy: The Ingredients of Intimacy, The Kinds of Intimacy and The Meaning of Intimacy. Findings of the research provided a detailed description of what was prerequisite to the intimate experience, the range of intimate experiences to be engaged in and the results of the intimate experience from the nurses' perspectives.

T1  - Evaluation of change in health status of chronic headache patients: Influence of patients' reference points and dispositional optimism
AN  - 304442064
AB  - In the current health care environment of cost containment, quality assurance and provider accountability, the measurement of outcomes has become both important and imperative in judging the effectiveness of any program or therapy. Health-Related Quality-of-Life is one such outcome measure used to evaluate the change in health and related physical, mental social and role functioning following any treatment.    Change in health status as it is currently measured (a difference between baseline and follow-up scores) does not account for individual differences in baselines or "reference points" nor the meaning of change to patients. This study proposed the presence of three categories of reference points: individualized, social and informational; which were hypothesized to be influenced by the individual's overall optimism. An overall, implicit generalized reference health state proposed as a combination of these reference points, was hypothesized to be a standard of comparison in evaluating change in health status. This study also proposed a distinction between the magnitude of change between baseline and follow-up scores and the evaluation of change as perceived by the patient. A conceptual model was developed based on the ideas presented above.    A pre-post study design was used to assess the reference points and change in health status. A sample of 100 newly diagnosed chronic headache patients were surveyed at two neurology clinics. Patients completed the baseline survey at the clinic following the physician interaction; follow-up surveys were completed at home after a month of treatment.    Results confirmed the presence of the informational and individualized reference points, the latter of which was influenced by optimism. The evidence for the generalized reference health state was inconclusive. The hypothesized difference between magnitude and evaluation of change was supported as was a direct relationship between the two. The model was disconfirmed as indicated by a poor fit to the data. However, a respecification of the model indicated that the reference points added value to the currently accepted model of measuring change in health status.    The primary contribution of this study was the presence of reference points and the concept of meaningfulness of a change in health status to patients.

T1  - Representations du travail et strategies de resolution de problemes de managers d'entreprises de haute technologie et d'entraineurs de volley-ball
AN  - 304449893
AB  - L'insatisfaction resultant des approches classiques de l'analyse du travail tient au fait qu'elles prennent rarement en consideration l'aspect cognitif lie au modele mental que possede le titulaire du poste. La methode de Kelly, dont la premisse centrale repose sur le contenu et la structure du systeme de construits refletant la construction d'un modele interne de l'environnement, a precisement pour avantage d'etre centree sur la representation que possedent les sujets de leur milieu de travail. Dans le contexte de notre recherche, ces "cartes mentales" sont constituees d'elements (composantes du travail) et de construits (dimensions permettant de les categoriser).    Le premier objectif de notre recherche consiste a demontrer les similarites et differences apparaissant entre la structure des representations que les managers et les entrai neurs possedent de leur activite professionnelle. Ceci revient a determiner les relations existant entre competences specifiques, caracteristiques de l'environnement de travail--au niveau technique, humain, et administratif--et contraintes. Les resultats (statistiques descriptives, analyses en composantes principales et contrastes) indiquent que les representations construites par les managers et les entrai neurs sur la base des dimensions "environnement" et "implication" presentent de fortes similitudes structurelles. Leurs representations different en revanche, d'un point de vue structurel, lorsqu'ils ont a evaluer les composantes de leur travail sur les construits "finalite" et "mesurabilite".    Notre second objectif vise precisement a demontrer les caracteristiques des strategies de resolution de problemes des sujets au travers du nombre, de l'ordre et de la nature des informations recherchees. La methode de l'information a la demande et, secondairement, une forme particuliere de protocole verbal (verbalisation retrospective assistee par la trace de l'execution de la tache) ont ete choisies afin suivre les processus cognitifs des managers et des entraineurs au cours de leur deroulement.    Bien que l'analyse descriptive du nombre de questions posees pour chacun des trois problemes suggere certaines differences entre ceux-ci, les resultats de l'ANOVA n'ont pas ditmontre de differences significatives entre les problemes ni entre le groupe des managers et celui des entrai neurs. La nature d'un probleme et le milieu professionnel n'influencent donc pas le nombre d'informations recherchees par les sujets.    Nos resultats revelent que les managers et les entrai neurs construisent leur representation du probleme a partir de la selection d'un nombre tres limite de facteurs presents dans l'enonce du probleme et de leur connaissance des caracteristiques de leur domaine. Il apparai t, de plus, que les sujets se servent des informations recueillies pour confirmer leur interpretation du probleme.    Les protocoles verbaux mettent en evidence que pour chacun des problemes les raisons amenant les managers et les entrai neurs a poser certaines questions ne sont pas les memes. Ce sont les proprietes du milieu professionnel qui determinent la nature et la priorite des contraintes a considerer: ces dernieres guident le processus de resolution et donc les strategies des sujets.    Dans le cas d'un probleme de strategie organisationnelle, tous les sujets recherchent en premier une information leur permettant de restreindre l'etendue du probleme. Au travers de l'ordre et de la nature des questions posees, il apparait que les managers tentent d'anticiper les consequences du probleme et d'y trouver des solutions. Les informations que les entrai neurs cherchent a obtenir visent a les preparer pour la solution qu'ils ont choisie. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - The psychiatric nurse's experience and meaning of "caring" in hospitals: A grounded theory of protective empowering
AN  - 304429361
AB  - This study explored with psychiatric nurses their experience and meaning of "caring" with patients in the hospitals. Seventeen registered nurses were interviewed from three general acute care psychiatric units, in two general hospitals and one psychiatric hospital. Using grounded theory qualitative methodology, it was discovered that "caring" occurred through a process called protective empowering, and a grounded theory of protective empowering was formulated. The nurses accomplished protective empowering of patients through six categories as evidenced through: (1) keeping the patient safe; (2) encouraging the patient's health; (3) authentic relating; (4) interactive teaching; (5) respecting the patient; and (6) not taking the patient's behaviour personally. Each of the six main categories of protective empowering were defined by specific subcategories. All six main categories appeared throughout the process of protective empowering, except that each category represented a different feature of protective empowering. The two main categories of respecting the patient and not taking the patient's behaviour personally were the antecedent and sustaining conditions of protective empowering. The other four categories keeping the patient safe, encouraging the patient's health, authentic relating, and interactive teaching represented the actions and contexts through which protective empowering changed. The consequence of protective empowering was manifested by the patient's ability to access their ability to act or accomplish their activities of daily living. The results suggest a practical and grass-roots theory of protective empowering that could be used as a valuable guide for articulating and reflecting on what psychiatric nurses do in their caring with patients on general psychiatric units; and, could be useful for both the clinical and political purposes of affirming and/or challenging the way in which psychiatric nurse "caring" with patients is articulated and allocated in hospitals.

T1  - Generating group agreement in cooperative computer-mediated groups: Towards an integrative model of group interaction
AN  - 304412781
AB  - This study addresses the problem of generating agreement in computer-mediated groups.    The key entities of group interaction are proposed to be the task, the other individuals, and the group. Extending this three way categorisation across the input-process-output framework suggests an integrative model, with three processes (task resolution, interpersonal relating, and group representation), three levels of social influence (informational influence, personal influence, and normative influence), and three types of output (task results, relationships, and agreement).    The background upon which these processes operate is the communication setting. A proposed taxonomy of communication settings suggests the natural setting for electronic groups may be asynchronous, many-to-many interaction.    Describing non-task group activities as "process losses" denies group combining behaviour, and raises the "group effectiveness paradox", where groups expend more effort to produce less. The integrative model accounts for group activities without paradox.    The generation of agreement in cooperative groups is attributed to the "identification" of individuals with the group. Members who identify with a group, tend to accept the group's decisions as their own. This process may use relatively simple position information embedded within multi-threaded communications, rather than complex "social" information. If so, computer-mediated groups can enact agreement across plain text networks.    Software was written to simulate asynchronous, many-to-many exchange of position information. Anonymous computer-mediated groups sat multi-choice tests under blind, group aware and confidence aware conditions. The exchange of position information alone produced a significant change in agreement, although neither medium nor exchanged information were "rich", no reasons were given, and there was no personal "presence" or discussion.    It was concluded that computer-mediated groups can enact agreement. The method adopted, of isolating one process within a single communication setting, is recommended for research. However for practical implementation, a balance of all three processes is suggested, as all have a role in group interaction.

T1  - Amount of food consumed by elderly nursing home residents with dementia as a function of the quality of the reciprocal relationship between nurse aide caregivers and residents, caregivers' power and empathy
AN  - 304390519
AB  - Persons with late-stage dementia enter relationships and interact with others in seemingly unpredictable ways. The offering of food by a caregiver and the acceptance of food by a care receiver could be construed to be an exchange. Social Exchange Theory was therefore used to investigate the interaction that occurs at mealtime as it influences an outcome--food consumed.    An observational, correlational study was conducted in a large, voluntary, urban nursing home. A sample of 53 unique dyads composed on 53 nursing home residents of diverse backgrounds, dependent in feeding (GDS = 6.08), with late-stage dementia (MMSE = 4.21) were observed during breakfast as fed by 53 Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA) who were largely women (age = 36.44) completing high school, 81% were Caribbean and 12.5% were African American. After obtaining consent from guardians, residents, and CNAs, the interaction was quantified using the Interaction Behavior Measure (IBM) and the Modified IBM. All meals were weighed (mean proportion = 63%) and timed (15.7 minutes). Food consumed was also measured on the subsequent two mornings. CNAs' level of empathy was measured using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and power by the Control subscale of the FIRO-B.    Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that the residents' behaviors of Personal Attending and Functional (IBM-M subscales) and the CNAs' abilities to allow another to control a relationship (FIRO-B Wanted Control subscale) were most predictive of the variance in the proportion of food consumed (adjusted $R\sp2$ =.41; $F\sb{3,49}$ = 12.54; p =.0001). The quality of the reciprocal relationship (IBM and IBM-M) accounted for 32% of the variance in the proportion of food consumed ($F\sb{6,46}$ = 5.13, p =.0004). CNA Wanted Control was correlated (r =.29, p $<$.05) to the proportion of food consumed. CNA level of empathy was found not to be related to the proportion of food consumed.    Feeding persons with dementia presents a profound challenge to caregivers. Future research needs to focus on both the task and process components of feeding as feeding dependence not only places persons with late-stage dementia at risk for development of illness and premature death, but also may deprive them of one of life's pleasures.

T1  - Disentangling feelings: Developing a taxonomy to be used in research on emotions in the workplace
AN  - 304365591
AB  - The ultimate goal of this research was to create a taxonomy of emotion terms that can be used in future studies on the role of emotions in work life. To achieve this goal, the research also pursued a number of sub-goals, namely: (1) to obtain conceptual clarification on the concept of emotion; (2) to create a comprehensive yet parsimonious word list on which the taxonomy would be based; (3) to distinguish affect-oriented terms from related terms that more accurately reflect dispositional characteristics (i.e., traits), physical states, and cognitive conditions, in addition to separating affect-oriented terms into moods and emotions; and (4) to identify the major dimensions of emotional states and to classify terms according to these dimensions. To achieve these goals, the research was divided into five empirical phases. The research began with the creation of a word list based on previous empirical research into the semantic structure of emotions. During Phase I, the initial word list was reduced and refined using a complex set of criteria. In Phase II, the list was further refined, with a panel of judges classifying terms according to a series of tests that distinguish affective phenomena from non-affective phenomena. The purpose of Phase III was to test whether valence was the dominant dimension by which emotions could be classified and to divide the list of terms into separate lists of positive and negative words. In Phase IV, other dimensions of emotions were identified and all emotion terms were subjected to a classification task based on the major dimensions identified. As a result of the previous phases, the taxonomy of emotion terms was created and finalized in Phase V.

T1  - Extraction and structure of domain knowledge for system development for alcohol addiction nursing
AN  - 304185120
AB  - The purpose of this study was to define the domain of alcohol addiction nursing in acute care practice settings. The study was undertaken as the preliminary step of expert system development based on nursing knowledge for this domain. The method elicited an initial set of domain related ideas. The resultant knowledge base is part of the substantive knowledge of nursing. The study was also undertaken as a method to systematically gather the knowledge in practice for theory development. The study isolated factors which are the building blocks for nursing practice theory.    The study used a knowledge acquisition strategy to elicit the knowledge of practicing expert nurses. Interactive interviewing was undertaken with fifteen certified nurses as they interacted with a computer assisted instruction (CAI) on the care of the alcohol addicted client presenting at a hospital emergency room. Interactive interviewing was characterized as taking its lead from verbalizations of the experts, probing with questions to explore deeper.    The knowledge was initially structured within seven categories posited by nursing scholars as central concepts in nursing and labeled in this study as the broad disciplinary conceptualizations (BDC's). The BDC's were used as a manifest representation of the nursing discipline. The analysis generated demarcation of the domain into patterns of knowledge each comprising the substance of nursing related to the nursing client, the nursing process, health, the environment, transitions, nursing interactions, and nursing therapeutics, i.e. the BDC's. An overview of the domain also resulted from a synthesis of descriptions provided by the expert alcohol addiction nurses describing what alcohol addictions is, and how it is different than other specialty areas of nursing. An exemplar of a patient was presented demonstrating the complexity of care in this domain.    The representation is incomplete in that it focuses only on acute care of alcohol addiction; no other addiction or phases of addiction. It only partially identifies the problem states or sequencing of problems in the domain. The problem states and the sequencing will be determined with further inquiry.
