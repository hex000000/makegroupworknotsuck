T1  - Trends in the receipt of medicines information among Finnish adults in 1999–2014: a nationwide repeated cross-sectional survey
AN  - 2240454625
AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to examine long-term trends in the receipt of medicines information (MI) among adult medicine users from 1999 to 2014.DesignRepeated cross-sectional postal survey from the years 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008–2014.SettingEach study year, a new nationally representative sample of 5000 Finns aged 15–64 years was drawn from the Population Register Centre of Finland.ParticipantsThe range of annual respondents varied from 2545 to 3371 and response rates from 53% to 67%. Of the total responses (n=29 465), 64% were from medicine users (n=18 862, ranging by year from 58% to 68%).Outcome measuresReceipt of information on medicines in use within 12 months prior to the survey from a given list of consumer MI sources available in Finland.ResultsPhysicians, community pharmacists and package leaflets were the most common MI sources throughout the study period. Receipt of MI increased most from the Internet (from 1% in 1999 to 16% in 2014), while decreased most from physicians (62% to 47%) and package leaflets (44% to 34%), and remained stable from community pharmacists (46% to 45%) and nurses (14% to 14%). In 1999, of the medicine users 4% did not report receipt of MI from any of the sources listed in the survey, while this proportion had remarkably increased to 28% in 2014.ConclusionsHealthcare professionals and package leaflets had still a dominating importance in 2014 despite the growing number of MI sources over time, but still a minority of adult medicine users reported receiving MI via the Internet in 2014. Worrying is that the proportion of adult medicine users who did not receive MI from any of the sources became seven fold during the study period.

T1  - Role of Trust in Converting Intention into Actual Purchase in an E-Marketing Stimuli (eM-stimuli) Induced Environment
AN  - 2202784731
AB  - This paper empirically investigates the role of trust in converting an intention to purchase, formed due to the impetus of eM-stimuli, into an actual purchase. It is among few studies on actual purchase in context of E-Marketing. An ex post facto experiment design is used with 300 participants and SEM in AMOS 21 was used for data analysis. Findings suggest a strong chance that an intention formed to purchase due to the effect of eM-stimuli will convert into an actual purchase. Institutional trust plays a very important background role in converting intention into an actual purchase in eM-stimuli induced environments. Managers should ensure trusting cues when creating eM-stimuli fostering institutional trust. Study was limited to convenience services and student population. Future research may further explore the variables and processes that are involved in converting intention into purchase in eM-stimuli induced environments, as well as on optimal eM-stimuli characteristics for different product and service categories.

T1  - UNDERSTANDING DETERMINANTS OF USER ACCEPTANCE OF WHATSAPP: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY
AN  - 2184026104
AB  - Technological advancements have significantly changed the way we distribute, create and share information these days. Popularity of smartphones and advancement in technology has made Whatsapp one of the most admired chatting and instant messaging (IM) communication application in India. It has become a popular, real-time tool that enables people for interactive communication by sending and receiving chat messages while managing several conversations at the same time. This has created a vast dependency on Whatsapp, enabling us to communicate, share pictures and videos from nearly anywhere, as long as access to internet is available. Mobile instant messaging is showing an upward trajectory growth. The study highlights the respondents' dependence on Whatsapp and the effect of dependency on their usage,with the help of statistical tools like correlation and regression analysis. Eight constructs, namely, Functional Value (FV), Social Value (SV), Emotional Value (EV), Perceived Ease Of Use (PE), Self Expression (SE), Trust (T), Monetary Value (MV), Perceived Service Quality (PSQ) were examined to assess the respondents' dependence on Whatsapp. The questionnaire based survey method was used to gather data from 189 mobile instant message users from North India. The findings of the study showed, that the perceived service quality(PSQ) is the decisive factor affecting respondents' dependence on Whatsapp.

T1  - The impact of customer satisfaction, customer experience and customer loyalty on brand power: empirical evidence from hotel industry
AN  - 2296393245
AB  - This research aims to investigate the impact of customer satisfaction, experience, and loyalty on brand power in the Hotel industry. This study used a descriptive-survey research design based on the correlation method. The selected populations were Pars Hotels’ customers. Sample size was 384, based on Krejcie and Morgan’s sampling table. The structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the causal simulation and to examine the reliability and validity of the measuring model. The research results showed that customer expectation has the most impact on customer satisfaction with path coefficient of 0.74. On the other hand, customer loyalty, with path coefficient of 0.65, is known as an influential factor. This study helps to understand that customer satisfaction and customer expectations are positive drivers of customer loyalty. Customer loyalty also is a strong predictor of brand power in hoteling and tourism industry. By strengthening that part, which you have better resources, you can have a better supply and thus, there would be more opportunities in establishing reputation and increasing visibility.

T1  - To Study the Relationship between Service Encounter and Retail Experience on Customer Satisfaction and Customer Loyalty with Impact of Loyalty Program Membership
AN  - 2126783566
AB  - The authors of the study are inquisitive to understand the relationship between Service Encounter and Retail Experience under the dynamic business environment in India. The purpose behind conducting this study was to examine the link between the customers ' idea of a retail customer experience (CE), service encounter and its effect on satisfaction and loyalty and to further establish the effect of loyalty programs on these links as well. The study was undertaken in Pune city, which is well established, and it has been evident to observe and possibly imitate entrance of international competitors. The data was collected using convenience-sampling technique from the Major supermarkets, hypermarkets, malls and single brand retail stores of Pune with or without loyalty programs based on their location and model of operations. In addition to that, partly data was collected using google forms to capture the attitude of retail customers from major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Ludhiana. The findings confirmed the model of customer experiences and service encounter leading to customer satisfaction and customer loyalty and supported positive relation with customer satisfaction. However, it discarded the role of loyalty programs membership in enhancing customer loyalty. Further studies can / may examine whether the findings hold true for each individual loyalty program or not. The paper calls for more studies and measures to encourage publication of negative empirical outcomes to ensure empirical generalization and selfcorrection in the literature. Managers in retail segment should focus their attention on the design and delivery of customer experience, without placing reliance on loyalty programs. Both cognitive and emotional attributes of retail services must be considered for managing a holistic Customer Experience.

T1  - Colliding the eye Tracking and Qualitative Methods in Assessing Online Consumer Behaviour
AN  - 2088044720
AB  - Interest in investigating consumer behavior from different perspectives and in different settings has increased. As we are living in the digitalized world, the important aspect of consumer behavior shifts to the digital platforms. Therefore, how customers response to online stimuli is the question to think about. The goal of this paper is to investigate the consumer behaviour online by applying the combination of eye tracking technology and qualitative research methods on a selected sample of university students. The controlled stimulus is the educational website. The emphasis is on the available measurements from both eye tracking data and interviews, their interconnection and interdependence. The overload of information a person receives in a day puts a pressure on creators of online and digital deliverables. We do know that human senses filter the information or visual elements, some of them reach the conscious and some of them remain unnoticed. Our study confirms that the value of eye tracking (ET) technology in explaining the consumer behaviour appears to be underestimated. Generally speaking, consumer neuroscience can significantly benefit research in the field of consumer behavior, particularly in the attempt to better understand human behavior in decision making processes. In particular, ET technology can help to the development of new products, including websites as well and adjust them to the needs of the targeted market. One of the greatest benefits of using eye tracking to improve the layout or the content on the website is that it does not involve asking or rating, but using. Moreover, considering its potential, there is a relatively small number of studies of ET but ET is already attracting the attention of marketers in areas not previously considered. In addition, our paper advocates that the deeper understanding of the ET results is achieved by applying other techniques, such as retrospective interviews. In a nutshell, we propose to digital marketers to use the combination of the eye movement measurement and the retrospective interviews when investigating the perceptions of the online content. The eye movements tell about individual's visual attention path, while the retrospective interviews let them re-live the experience.

T1  - The Patient Experience: Informing Practice through Identification of Meaningful Communication from the Patient’s Perspective
AN  - 2026629453
AB  - (1) Background: There is limited empirical knowledge concerning aspects of healthcare that contribute to a good patient experience from the patient’s perspective and how patient feedback informs service development. (2) Aim: To examine the issues that influence the effectiveness of communication on patient satisfaction, experience and engagement, in an acute National Health Service (NHS) setting, through identification of the patient’s requirements and expectations. (3) Method: Data was gathered from a large teaching hospital using a Friends and Family Test (FFT) and a communication specific survey. Both surveys captured patient narrative to identify predominant influences to explain the quantitative responses. (4) Results: The key priorities for patients are involvement in their care and receiving the right amount of information to support this. However, the delivery of compassionate care was identified as having the most influence on the likelihood of patients to recommend an acute NHS Trust. (5) Conclusion: The findings support a broader understanding of the constituents of an all-encompassing patient experience from the patient’s perspective. (6) Implications: healthcare organizations need to focus their resources on how to improve patient/provider communication to support patients to be true partners in their care.

T1  - Qualitative Marketing Research: The State of Journal Publications
AN  - 1938992268
AB  - Qualitative methods in marketing have become essential not only for their classical advantage in consumer behavior, but also for their benefits in dealing with big data and data mining. Research from International Data Corporation (IDC) shows that when it comes to online data, unstructured content accounts for 90% of all digital information. Under these circumstances, this study provides a literature review and analysis on the role and relation of qualitative methods with quantitative methods in marketing research. The paper analyzes research articles that include qualitative studies in the top marketing journals during the last decade and focuses on their topic, domain, methods used and whether they used any triangulation with quantitative methods. Starting from this analysis, the study provides recommendations that can help better integrate qualitative methods in marketing research, academics and practice.

T1  - Achieving Requisite Variety in Customer Experience Research for Improving Marketing Relationship Performances
AN  - 2113231307
AB  - This special issue includes 27 customer experience (CX) trade tales as told in the words of real shoppers and customers. Some tales are of dilemmas and cognitive dissonance, whilst others share their elation at receiving the value, satisfaction, and respect they felt they deserved. When reading these accounts, you are likely to agree that there is much more to consumers' everyday buying decisions and experiences than what meets the eye of the customer care officer, the representative or business owner (collectively called marketers here) at first glance. The emotive language and illustrative narratives emphasize the affective, intellectual, emotional, and social impact of good and bad responses by organizations to interactions with customers. You will quickly notice how positively-inclined customers can turn from highly impressed, excited and actively engaged clients, to negatively valanced antagonists, defending their point of view, or (in sharp contrast) respond to a sales interaction with passive aggressive behaviour. Surface to deep assessment follow each trade tale. Many of the tales are useful materials for creating emotional and insightful learning dramas for improving empathy and communication skills of those among us who interact with customers.

T1  - An Exhaustive View on Supervision in Social Work: History, Evolution, Current Trends
AN  - 1906861434
AB  - Abstract. Supervising professionals in the practice of social work, in particular, and in the professions related to humans in distress, in general, plays a crucial role in the evolution of social workers. Increasing professional effectiveness by understanding the mechanisms involved in the interaction with the human factor brings forth the three main functions of supervision: administrative, educational, and supportive. From this perspective, the professional supervisee looks at his supervisor for leader, counsellor, and evaluator competencies. Though the interprofessional and intercultural dimensions of supervision can somehow vary, a pragmatic approach of supervision based on empirical premises provides the professionals working with humans in distress the proper framework for fulfilling the needs of the latter.

T1  - A Study of Revisit Intention: Experiential Quality and Image of Muara Beting Tourism Site in Bekasi District
AN  - 1902637911
AB  - This research aims to examine the interrationship among the experiential quality, tourism site image and experiantial satisfaction toward the revisit intention of the tourism site visitors. The number of respondents in this research were 160 tourists that have visited the Muara Beting tourism site in Bekasi District. The research is based on a confirmatory model. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the help of AMOS statistic program was used to test the validity and the realibility of the instruments, goodness of fit model and the interrationship that were hypothesized in the proposed teoritical model. The structural model proved that almost all of the hypothesized relationship were proven to be confirmed. The results revealed that there are positive impact of experiential quality towards the experiential satisfaction and Muara Beting image. Experiential satisfaction is affected by experiential quality and tourism site image. The revisit intention is affected by the experiential satisfaction, but the tourism site image is not statistically proven affecting the revisit intention.

T1  - Challenges of Collecting B2B Customer Insight from Multiple Channels
AN  - 2133373962
AB  - The purpose of the paper is to study the challenges that B2B companies are confronting when trying to understand their current and potential customers through digital channels and utilizing these viewpoints in innovation development. The paper combines literature on innovation, B2B customer experience and challenges related to digital channel usage. The study comprises 17 qualitative customer interviews and a web survey for 167 customers. The paper discusses why the customers want or do not want to express their needs in digital channels and if some of those reasons are dependent on sellers' or customers' actions. As a result, a categorisation of buyers according to their role in buying and social media usage at work is presented. Identified challenges are grouped into data, process or management challenges.

T1  - Factors contributing to medicine-related problems in adult patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular diseases in Saudi Arabia: a qualitative study
AN  - 2099419053
AB  - ObjectivesTo investigate the factors contributing to medicine-related problems (MRPs) among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and/or diabetes in Saudi Arabia.DesignQualitative semistructured interviews were conducted. Interviews were audio recorded then transcribed into Microsoft Word. The transcribed interviews were then imported into the qualitative analysis software NVivo where thematic analysis was applied. Thematic synthesis was achieved by coding and developing subthemes/themes from the findings of the interviews.SettingFive healthcare centres in Najran, Saudi Arabia.Participants25 adult patients with diabetes and/or CVDs.ResultsThe study cohort included 16 men and 9 women with a median age of 61.8 years (40–85 years). Diabetes was the main condition encountered among 23 patients and CVDs were reported among 18 patients. Perceived factors leading to MRPs were of four types and related to: patient-, healthcare system-, clinical (condition-) and medicine-related factors. Patient-related factors were related to living situation, religious practices, diet/exercise and patients’ behaviour towards the condition and medicines. Healthcare system-related factors comprised sources and availability of medicines, ease of access to healthcare system and patient satisfaction with healthcare providers. Clinical (condition-) related factors associated with both the knowledge and control over condition, and effects of the condition among medicines intake. Medicine-related factors included lack of knowledge about medicines and medicine use.ConclusionsThe results of this study uncovered many factors associated with MRPs among patients with CVDs and diabetes in Saudi Arabia, especially in reference to lifestyle and medicine use. Improving communication with healthcare professional alongside the introduction of national clinical guidance would mitigate the unwanted health complications related to medicine use.

T1  - TOWARDS A HOLISTIC CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ENTERPRISES
AN  - 1843292537
AB  - We have entered the age of the customer where customer choice is the main differentiator between enterprises. Therefore, enterprises need to shift their focus to customer experience management (CEM). A survey conducted within the telecommunications sector indicated a gap between theoretical CEM approaches and their implementation in enterprises. Although a systematic literature review and inductive thematic analysis of CEM literature revealed nine common themes, none of the existing approaches includes all of these themes in a comprehensive way. Based on those nine themes, this paper presents a new holistic framework for CEM that managers and practitioners concerned with improving customer experiences could use.

T1  - Theorising on risk homeostasis in the context of information security behaviour
AN  - 1844295616
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to discuss and theorise on the appropriateness and potential impact of risk homeostasis in the context of information security.Design/methodology/approachThe discussion is mainly based on a literature survey backed up by illustrative empirical examples.FindingsRisk homeostasis in the context of information security is an under-explored topic. The principles, assumptions and methodology of a risk homeostasis framework offer new insights and knowledge to explain and predict contradictory human behaviour in information security.Practical implicationsThe paper shows that explanations for contradictory human behaviour (e.g. the privacy paradox) would gain from considering risk homeostasis as an information security risk management model. The ideas discussed open up the prospect to theorise on risk homeostasis as a framework in information security and should form a basis for further research and practical implementations. On a more practical level, it offers decision makers useful information and new insights that could be advantageous in a strategic security planning process.Originality/valueThis is the first systematic comprehensive review of risk homeostasis in the context of information security behaviour and readers of the paper will find new theories, guidelines and insights on risk homeostasis.

T1  - Aesthetics by Numbers: Links between Perceived Texture Qualities and Computed Visual Texture Properties
AN  - 2290832955
AB  - Our world is filled with texture. For the human visual system, this is an important source of information for assessing environmental and material properties. Indeed – and presumably for this reason– the human visual system has regions dedicated to processing textures. Despite their abundance and apparent relevance, only recently the relationships between texture features and high-level judgments have captured the interest of mainstream science, despite long-standing indications for such relationships. In this study, we explore such relationships, as these might be used to predict perceived texture qualities. This is relevant, not only from a psychological/neuroscience perspective, but also for more applied fields such as design, architecture, and the visual arts. In two separate experiments, observers judged various qualities of visual textures such as beauty, roughness, naturalness, elegance, and complexity. Based on factor analysis, we find that in both experiments, ~75% of the variability in the judgments could be explained by a two-dimensional space, with axes that are closely aligned to the beauty and roughness judgments. That a two-dimensional judgment space suffices to capture most of the variability in the perceived texture qualities suggests that observers use a relatively limited set of internal scales on which to base various judgments, including aesthetic ones. Finally, for both of these judgments, we determined the relationship with a large number of texture features computed for each of the texture stimuli. We find that the presence of lower spatial frequencies, oblique orientations, higher intensity variation, higher saturation, and redness correlates with higher beauty ratings. Features that captured image intensity and uniformity correlated with roughness ratings. Therefore, a number of computational texture features are predictive of these judgments. This suggests that perceived texture qualities – including the aesthetic appreciation – are sufficiently universal to be predicted – with reasonable accuracy – based on the computed feature content of the textures.

T1  - Perspectives of Service-Dominant Logic for Innovation Management: A Bibliometric Analysis
AN  - 1803692377
AB  - Originally stemming from the field of marketing, the service-dominant logic concept has gained broad interest in many areas of in management research during the last ten years. However, the concept is still in its infancy and lacks a sold anchoring in extant theory as well as a traceable integration in well-stablished research fields. In this paper, we analyze the current state of service-dominant logic influenced research and identify future research directions against the background of a bibliometric analysis. This allows for identifying the core fields of impact of the service-dominant logic and helps to uncover overlaps between the different research areas. Our findings provide a first holistic picture of service-dominant logic research and help to pave the way for a future development of this concept as we highlight research potential that is inherent in this concept.

AB  - From April 1st 2015 it will be mandatory for Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the United Kingdom (UK) providing pre-qualifying health care higher education to use a Values Based Recruitment (VBR) tool, to ensure only the candidates with the "right" personal identity and values commensurate with the Professional Identity of Nursing (PIN) are accepted for nurse education. "Nurse Match" instrument was developed to enhance the recruitment and selection of candidates for pre-qualifying nursing. Action Research into PIN commenced with voluntary, purposive, convenience samples of qualified nurses (n = 30), Service Users (N = 10), postgraduate diploma nurses in mental health (N = 25), third year mental health branch students (N = 20) and adult and child student nurses in years 2 and 3 (N = 20) in Focus Groups. Data collection and analysis occurred concomitantly between July 2013 and October 2014, aided by NVivo 10 software and revealed Key Quality Indicators (KQIs) of the social construction of PIN. Construct development included a literature review spanning the last fifteen years, which identified four main themes;
1. Nursing's ethics and values.
2. Nursing's professional identity and caring.
3. Nursing's emotional intelligence.
4. Nursing's professionalism.
Nurse Match offers an evidence-based enhancement to VBR, for future nurse recruitment locally, nationally and internationally.

T1  - DOES CUSTOMER VALUE CREATION BEHAVIOR DRIVE CUSTOMER WELL-BEING?
AN  - 1768189017
AB  - To address the potential ambivalent effects of customer value creation behavior (CVCB) in a service setting, we developed a theoretical model identifying separate psychological mechanisms that account for both positive and negative effects of CVCB on customer outcomes, such as customer value and customer well-being. Participants comprised 103 business customer-supplier dyads. The results show that CVCB enhanced customer outcomes through the intermediate mechanism of customer self-determination, but hindered customer outcomes by generating customer role stress. In addition, the results indicate that relationship quality moderates the effect of CVCB on customer self-determination and role stress, thus channeling its effect in either a positive or a negative direction. The results offer insight into the mixed findings on customer behavior in the service literature.

T1  - An Integrated Approach to Attracting and Retaining Teachers in Rural and Remote Parts of Australia
AN  - 1870862784
AB  - This paper presents an argument for an integrated approach to attracting and retaining rural and remote teachers. It describes existing government funded research and state government policies in this domain. It builds upon existing sociological models to propose a model of the factors influencing teacher decisions to teach in a rural location and to stay in a location. Based upon this model and the background literature the paper proposes that policy ought to be directed towards addressing both internal and external influences upon teacher behaviours in an integrated way.

T1  - Impact of Michelangelo prosthetic hand: Findings from a crossover longitudinal study
AN  - 1722885184
AB  - This work explores the functional and psychosocial impact of the multigrip Michelangelo (M) prosthetic hand. Transradial myoelectric prosthesis users (6 men, median age: 47 y) participated in a crossover longitudinal study. A multifactorial assessment protocol was applied before the application of M and after 3 mo (functional assessment) and 6 mo (psychosocial assessment) of home use. Functional assessment included both practical tests (i.e., Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure [SHAP], Box and Blocks Test [BBT], and Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test [MMDT]) and self-report functional scales. Psychosocial assessment consisted of a clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires concerning current anxious-depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life, body image concerns, adjustment and satisfaction with prosthesis, social support, coping style, and personality. Increased manual dexterity was observed after 3 mo based on improvements in the SHAP, BBT, and MMDT. Two important themes emerged from the clinical interviews at the 6 mo follow-up: (1) the enhanced functionality and (2) the "like a real hand" aspect of the M, which further increased prosthesis integration to the Self. A few patients expressed concerns about M dimension, noise, and weight. The M appeared to restore hand function and natural appearance. The present findings provide preliminary evidence, and additional studies are needed.

T1  - Evaluation of Product Design Analyses for the Identification of Perception-Defining Characteristics
AN  - 1861158431
AB  - In most cases, customers evaluate a product based on the first impression, which is propagated by the product itself. These impressions are often subjectively engraved in the products, difficult to describe thus making them difficult to handle. Technical specifications on the other hand are less considered at first sight. In the case of leisure products such as Motorbikes (motorcycles), subjective factors are considerably intensified. Thus, such products are suitable to describe as "difficult-to-quantify" characteristics. Subjective and difficult to quantify features for products such as motorcycles could be; the design, the dynamics (vitality) as well as the price (value) impression.

              
Thus, amid a DFG research project, a method will have to be developed that allows the scaling of difficult to quantify characteristics in other to support a requirement-orientated product development. For this purpose, four different levels were developed to contain scaling based on usage. To support the scaling development, methods such as the AHP or the Multivariate Analysis Method can be used.

              
In the following analysis it will be shown how perception-defining characteristics for motorcycles can be derived from design analyses. The first step is the design analyses conducted with the help of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) scale based on Thomas L. Saaty. The advantage of this approach is a direct comparison of all alternatives to themselves. If, for example, five motorcycles are compared with regards to design, then a benchmark for good design implicitly arises. These scales build up dynamically depending on the analyzed alternatives. Based on the previous example, the more alternatives are used the more valid the scale.

              
The systematic arrangement of the perception-defining characteristics in product development can be a deciding factor for a better product design and its related product perception. Special gender specific perception differences for motorcycles will be evaluated in this paper. Thus, it is shown that there are specific motorcycle models that appeal to women while other specific models are preferred by men. In this case, perception-defining characteristics can be derived from a detail analysis of a preliminary assessment which can aid the description of female and male preferences for motorcycles.

              
In this paper a method to concatenate the perception-defining characteristics and products will be presented. Above all, these characteristics should be considered in the product planning phase. This approach offers producers the possibility, through identification of important perception-defining characteristics, to differentiate themselves from competitors because important product characteristics are deigned to relate to the various target groups.

T1  - Perceived managerial and leadership effectiveness in Colombia
AN  - 2085696305
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this study was to identify what Colombians perceive as effective and least effective/ineffective managerial behavior. Design/methodology/approach – This study was conducted following a qualitative methodology based on the philosophical assumptions of pragmatism and the “pragmatic approach” (Morgan, 2007). The critical incident technique was used to generate data from a purposive sample of 27 managers and non-managerial employees located in Medellin and Bogota, Colombia. Findings – The results of this study suggest that effective managers in Colombia are those who are supportive, caring, considerate, participative, understanding, communicative and flexible, and are also good problem solvers. Research limitations/implications – This study focused on the perceptions of Colombian managers and non-managerial employees only. Therefore, the description of effective and least effective/ineffective managers in Colombia could be highly value-laden from the national cultural perspective. Hence, it is recommended that further research should be carried out to explore the perceptions of international managers who have frequently interacted or worked with Colombian managers. Originality/value – The results of this study have practical implications for Colombian managers and international managers who manage the Colombian workforce. For Colombian managers, this study provides insight into what is considered effective or least effective/ineffective managerial and leadership behavior. The findings provide useful information on foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) that have operations in Colombia. MNCs can use the results of this study to create effective management development models for their expatriates in Colombia.

T1  - An exploration of the HRM values of Chinese managers working in Western multinational enterprises in China: implications for HR practice
AN  - 1498233799
AB  - This paper qualitatively explores the nature of human resource management (HRM) values of local Chinese managers working in Western-based multinational enterprises in China and also considers how these values are associated with preferences for HR practices. The study involves the use of repertory grid interviews with 36 local Chinese managers. The study shows that interviewees reflected a high level of assimilation and internalization of many Western HRM values. Interviewees also retained many traditional Chinese values, thus highlighting the role of institutional and cultural forces on HRM. However, among these local managers, there was clear decline in some traditional Chinese values, such as 'harmony' and 'virtue'. A further interesting finding was the co-existence of paradoxical values of collectivism and individualism among the managers. Analyses of repertory grid data and interview comments also highlight that preferences for HR practices is associated with these underlying HRM values. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN CIVIL AVIATION SECTOR
AN  - 1535387542
AB  - Creating a superior customer experience has been gaining increased attention in the service sector. The diverse market offerings that stimulate enduring experience, which customers cherish, have competitive edge over most competing products or services. Customer experience acts as an emerging opportunity in this fast-paced highly competitive world, especially in the new horizon of experience economy. Due to an increasing growth rate and diversity of airline passengers, customer experience is emerging as a critical element in civil aviation sector. It is crucial for airlines to offer great experiences to passengers in order to gain a competitive advantage. This paper thus examines the nature and extent of customer experience in civil aviation sector. More specifically, the study explores dimensions of customer experience in civil aviation sector using EFA. The study is based on data of sample size of 1005 respondents from selected airlines namely Air India, Jet Airways and Kingfisher. The results of exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical regression model and ANOVA depict that customer experience is a multidimensional construct, It further suggests that there is a significant impact of experiential dimensions on overall customer experience. and there exists significant difference on the basis of airlines regarding customer experience. The results also reveal that Jet Airways has higher level of customer experience followed by Kingfisher and Air India.

AB  - To study the body image built by patients with breast cancer after surgery, radical mastectomy and partial mastectomy, related to body parts directly involved in surgery and not directly related to it, and to investigate how this image affects bodily self-esteem. Our sample comprised 23 patients (12 had been subjected to radical mastectomy and 11 to partial mastectomy) and 24 healthy women (they served as control group). Participants were assessed with the Body Grid technique. We analyzed the differences between groups using one way ANOVA and non-parametric tests (namely, H de Kruskal Wallis and U de Mann-Whitney). Our findings allowed us to identify which were the most damaged aspects about self-esteem and body image in these patients, showing that there were no significant differences in body image and bodily self-esteem between patients subjected to radical and partial mastectomy. However, we found significant differences between body parts directly involved in surgery and those not directly related to it. Finally, we found significant differences between both groups of patients and the control group regarding body image and self-esteem. Our results show that the Body Grid Technique is helpful to identify the most affected aspects of body image in patients subjected to mastectomy and tailor psychological treatments aimed at improving body image in these patients.

T1  - Employee Engagement in an Animal Research Facility
AN  - 1548331045
AB  - Disengaged employees cost U.S. research hospitals approximately $29 million per year, compromising organizational growth. The purpose of this exploratory, single-case study was to discover how employee disengagement might compromise an animal research facility's business growth and integrity. Guided by the theory of psychological capital, this study gathered interview data from 10 animal care employees who discussed their perceptions leading to engagement or disengagement while working at the facility. Findings from these interview data were with meeting notes and survey results from past employee engagement meetings to enhance the trustworthiness of the results. Key themes were to (a) revise the timekeeping policy to promote a better work/life balance, (b) adapt a metric to reestablish quality expectations and a strategy for noncompliance, and (c) provide counsel for an immediate change in communication style from one manager. The characterization of the negative organizational and social effects of employee disengagement was consistent with the study findings and the literature review. The results of this research study might show improvements in employee satisfaction and contribute to social change by informing facility leaders on the challenges and opportunities faced by animal care employees while working at the selected location. Increased engagement will encourage improved performance and teamwork, ultimately improving animal welfare and increasing the likelihood of successful animal research.

T1  - Typographic Layout and First Impressions - Testing how changes in text layout influence readers' judgments of documents
AN  - 1547940051
AB  - This study explores how the typographic layout of information influences readers' impressions of magazine contents pages. Thirteen descriptors were used in a paired comparison procedure that assessed whether participants' rhetorical impressions of a set of six controlled documents change in relation to variations in layout. The combinations of layout attributes tested were derived from the structural attributes associated with three patterns of typographic differentiation (high, moderate, and low) described in a previous study (see Moys, 2014). The content and the range of stylistic attributes applied to the test material were controlled in order to focus on layout attributes. Triangulation of the quantitative and qualitative data indicates that, even within the experimental confines of limited stylistic differentiation, the layout attributes associated with patterns of high, moderate, and low typographic differentiation do influence readers' rhetorical judgments. In addition, the findings emphasize the importance of considering interrelationships between clusters of typographic attributes rather than testing isolated variables.

T1  - Professional standards, competence and capability
AN  - 1493451484
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the idea of competence in its various forms provides a sufficient basis for developing standards of professional practice. Design/methodology/approach - Three existing studies of professional standards and qualifying processes are drawn upon, carried out by the author in 2007, 2009 and 2012. Findings - Professional standards frameworks are informed by several different approaches to competence, although an external or activity-based approach - similar in principle to that used in UK occupational standards - predominates. However, there are limits to the extent to which a competence-based approach can adequately represent complex professional work, and there is scope to improve the relevance and robustness of frameworks through introducing the idea of capability. Evidence is presented to show that this is beginning to occur in some of the better-designed recent frameworks. Practical implications - Using the idea of capability in professional standards is likely to have two implications. One is that standards focus at a high level on the work of the profession rather than on specific job roles, and the other is that pervasive themes such as ethics, judgement and professionalism are written into the standards in a way that ensures they apply across the breadth of practice rather than become treated as separate topics or areas of competence. Originality/value - Professional standards frameworks have generally been considered purely in terms of competence. The idea of capability introduces approaches that make them more able to respond to factors such as emergent contexts, evolving and contested practices and the need for intelligent judgement and lived ethical practice.

T1  - Contact between deceased donors' families and organ recipients: Official Publication of the North American Transplant Coordinators Organization
AN  - 1561067775; 24311398
AB  - The benefits and disadvantages of posttransplant contact between a donor family and the organ recipient are disputed. In this study far more contacters reported benefits rather than disadvantages and noncontacters reported the opposite. The dissatisfaction of noncontacters with no contact was high: no less than 60% wanted some form of contact in the future. The authors conclude that contact has more benefits for the donor family than disadvantages, evidenced by families' desire to maintain contact with the organ recipient. Both donor families and organ recipients need the transplant coordinator's initiative and guidance on this issue.

T1  - The mediation role of trust in knowledge sharing: A cognitive perspective in Chinese architectural design teams
AN  - 1441365399
AB  - Purpose - Some researchers claim that trust can directly affect knowledge sharing but others consider that it is a mediator between some independent variables and knowledge sharing. So the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether trust is a mediator for knowledge sharing in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - Personal construct theory is employed to test the mediation role of trust in architectural design teams. A questionnaire survey of architects is conducted in Beijing, Shanghai and Qingdao, People's Republic of China. The mediator model is tested using structural equation modeling. Findings - The paper shows that the mediation role of trust between two personal construct based factors, i.e. social interaction (SI) and attitude on work (AttonW) and willingness to share knowledge is supported. Research limitations/implications - As the paper focusses on architects working in the early-design stage of a project, the findings may not be applicable to other stages. In future, other project actors should also be considered so as to investigate the issues in construction management in a more comprehensive way. Practical implications - The results suggest that team managers should improve the SIs between team members and provide guidance to team members about the correct attitude on work so that the level of interpersonal trust can be enhanced, thereby knowledge sharing is encouraged. Originality/value - The personal construct theory developed in clinical psychology is applied to study the mediation role of trust for knowledge sharing in the construction industry. The interdisciplinary research offers a theoretical framework to reveal the cognitive process of knowledge sharing.

T1  - An Expert System-based Context-Aware Ubiquitous Learning Approach for Conducting Science Learning Activities
AN  - 1462203950
AB  - Context-aware ubiquitous learning has been recognized as being a promising approach that enables students to interact with real-world learning targets with supports from the digital world. Several researchers have indicated the importance of providing learning guidance or hints to individual students during the context-aware ubiquitous learning process. In this study, an expert system-based guidance approach is proposed for conducting effective context-aware ubiquitous learning activities based on the domain knowledge provided by experienced teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment on a learning activity in a senior high school Geosciences course has been conducted. The experimental results show that, with this new approach, the students’ learning achievements have been significantly improved in terms of several cognitive processes in Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives, such as “analyzing” and “evaluating.” Consequently, it is concluded that the context-aware ubiquitous learning system with the interactive guiding approach has benefited the students in enhancing their higher order thinking competences.

AN  - 2033039424
AB  - During the start of a new business, the entrepreneur often conceives the brand image and leads in its implementation. As the environment changes and the organization development, are the brands images built by corporations and perceived by consumers consistent? Why and how should this inconsistency be resolved are the main topics of this study. This study conducted in-depth interviews with case study companies using Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) and Brand Concept Map. The results of the study discover that the founder’s image of the brand is most closely aligned with the vision at the founding of the company; it is, however, vulnerable to inertia caused by self-reinforcement. Marketing managers are more sensitive to environmental changes. Their cognition of the brand image, asides from having new ideas, is also closer to the market. Front-line staff may be far from core decision-making, but because of their interaction with consumers, despite subjective influences, they are the primary channels in which corporations communicate their brand image. Therefore, including what front-line staff perceive consumer’s brand image in the brand image conveyed by the corporation is the best means to narrow the differences between internal and external brand images.Alternate abstract:廠商創業時，品牌形象的構思與執行，常由創業者主導，隨環境改變與組織發展，廠商 建構與消費者所認知的品牌形象，是否具一致性？為何以及如何尋求解決不一致性？成 為本研究主要議題.本研究運用隱喻抽取技術 (ZMET) 與品牌概念地圖，對個案公司進 行深度訪談.研究結果發現創業者品牌形象與創立時的願景最為接近，但易受自我強化 而產生慣性.行銷主管對環境變化較敏感，認知的品牌形象，除較具新構思外且與市場 較為貼近.門市人員雖遠離決策核心，但因與消費者互動，雖受自我主觀知覺影響，卻 是企業傳達品牌形象的主要管道，因此將其認知到的消費者品牌形象知覺，納入修正公 司所傳遞的品牌形象，有助於縮小公司與消費者之間的品牌形象差異.

T1  - Psychological adjustment to diabetes mellitus: highlighting self-integration and self-regulation
AN  - 1269500185; 20473694
AB  - Psychological adjustment to any chronic disease, such as diabetes mellitus, concerns self-view rearrangement toward self-integrity and self-regulation. Both distance between self and disease paired with positive and negative new identities may contribute to adaptation to diabetes. The present investigation aimed to detect main trends on self-management in patients with both diabetes types within a self-regulatory framework. Sample consisted of 121 adult patients with both diabetes types. Answer to question about having diabetes or being a diabetic was combined with self-benefices or self-damages concerning diabetes in a 2 × 2 combination. Psychological adjustment to diabetes, anxiety and depression were evaluated among subgroups. Almost 16% of patients had any benefit with diabetes and a better psychological adjustment than patients reporting losses. Type 1 diabetes answered more "being diabetic" and type 2 "having diabetes". Education was positively associated with profits with diabetes. Patients referring "to have diabetes" and profits had the best diabetes psychological adjustment. Distance between self and diabetes does not seem to relate to psychological adjustment. Type 1 diabetes patients are likely to identify more with their disease comparing with type 2 diabetes, independently from gains or losses associated with diabetes. Better psychological adjustment related to more education and positivity highlights future interest on working with gains in diabetes patient education, fostering patient self-growth, self-integration and resilience.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A segmentation study of Mexican consumers based on shopping centre attractiveness
AN  - 1081416783
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify shopping centre attractiveness dimensions from the point of view of the Mexican shopper and then segment shoppers according to these perceptions of attractiveness. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through a survey of 1,500 regular shopping centre consumers from the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara (MAG), Mexico. This research study was carried out from January to April 2010. Five of the largest shopping centres, including a lifestyle centre, a community centre, a regional shopping centre, and a small regional shopping centre participated voluntarily in this research study. Findings - The attractiveness attributes of six shopping centres were identified through a factorial analysis: mall essence, popularity and promotional programs, personal service, recreational options, internal atmosphere, and external atmosphere. Also, a cluster analysis of these factors revealed three types of consumers with significantly different perceptions of shopping centres: serious, enthusiast, and basic. The outcomes were validated by a multiple discriminant analysis. Multiple discriminant results suggest that the dimension of popularity and promotion programs is the first to be distinguished among segments, followed by internal and external atmosphere. Practical implications - From a managerial perspective, the study provides practical advice to managers in order to support marketing and positioning strategies for their shopping centres, focusing on a particular segment of consumers. Originality/value - This study contributes to the body of research on shopping centre attractiveness and shopper segments by providing information regarding Mexican consumer perceptions of shopping.

T1  - Conducting Consistent Laddering Interviews Using CLAD
AN  - 1268175509
AB  - Consistent Laddering is an interviewing technique that is build on top of Laddering technique, which has been used most often in psychotherapy, consumer research, and knowledge acquisition. This paper points out distinctions and advantages of Consistent Laddering over the original technique, as well as some difficulties that concern both techniques. The main purpose of this article is to show how Consistent Laddering interviews are conducted, and how measures employed in this technique are used to detect difficulties that can occur in an interview. Because it is not possible to conduct Consistent Laddering interviews without a computer program, corresponding software, named CLAD, has been developed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Identity Concerns or Functional Concerns? High vs Low Identifiers Reaction to Brand Identity Change
AN  - 921259922
AB  - Brand repositioning may cause a loss of attributes that formerly characterized it. This study investigates how consumers react to the potential disappearance of such attributes. Specifically, it addresses the question whether consumers are more concerned about the pragmatic consequences for achieving their own goals, or about the emotional consequences for their sense of pride and their feelings that the brand may no longer be the same brand. Our findings show that to some extent consumers worry about the potential disappearance of those brand attributes that are important to express their identity. So, their degree of identification with the brand matters. However, our findings show that they are much more concerned about attributes that help them reach their objectives. The results show how pragmatic consumers' reaction to brand repositioning can be even in situations where customers have long-lasting intensive contact with the brand. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Modelling customer process activities in interactive value creation
AN  - 898417822
AB  - Purpose - Customers' role in value creation has changed dramatically over the past few years. Today, many firms view customers as co-creators of value. Until recently, however, attention to customer integration was mainly directed toward customers' role in a firm's given supply processes. The goal of this paper is to show that processes on the customer side are equally important for the overall success of value creation. Design/methodology/approach - The reasoning for the role of customers is based on a theoretical discussion of customer integration, blueprints and customer scripts. Relating this work to the general problem of transaction costs from information asymmetries, the paper develops a typology of how customer scripts can be applied in various situations. Findings - It is found that customer scripts can have a positive effect on interactive value creation because they enable companies to build a holistic process image for all process participants. Research limitations/implications - Marketing must rethink its role as an agent of companies. Indeed, in interactive value creation, boundaries blur. However, the results lack broad empirical confirmation. Practical implications - It is argued that firms must adopt a customer perspective and provide an approach of how to achieve this. Originality/value - The paper reintroduces scripts in the marketing discussion. In addition, it provides a new typology of situations in interactive value creation.

T1  - DETERMINING SERVICES FOR THE MOBILE TOURIST
AN  - 808409733
AB  - The increasing popularity of mobile devices presents an opportunity for developing innovative mobile tourism services for tourism-related organizations. While there is much research on mobile tourism applications and on tourist needs and behavior, there is comparatively less work on studying the types of services they desire. The present study aims to determine mobile services that are important from the tourists' perspective using a factor analytic approach. This was first done via a survey of the literature and confirmed by a focus group. The set of candidate tourism services was then translated into a questionnaire for determining their appropriateness for mobile tourism. Thereafter, exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic procedures were performed. Our findings show that tourists appear to favor basic services such as those providing information about transportation, accommodation and food, while advanced ones such as context-aware services and trip planning were deemed comparatively less desirable. Practical and theoretical implications of our findings are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Capturing and evaluating process information for high-performance complex manufacturing operations: IMS
AN  - 347428089
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology for rapidly and reliably capturing, representing and analysing process systems to facilitate the potential for operations performance improvement within a complex product design and manufacturing facility operating in a high-performance business environment.  This paper demonstrates the proposed methodology within an electro-mechanical design and manufacturing environment producing complex non-standard products for a global market. The technique has national and international application for a wide spectrum of design and manufacturing facilities.  The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in capturing, representing and analysing processes to assess the feasibility of and identify the issues involved in realising further performance improvements in an existing complex product, high variety, design and manufacturing facility.  Through the enhanced level of understanding of business processes and knowledge intensive operations, the design and manufacturing facilities managers can now realise the next level of performance enhancement by fully exploiting the potential of performance improvement initiatives. Since the proposed methodology creates an environment in which risks inherent in new techniques are controlled, the facilities managers can also gain competitive advantage by becoming the early adopters of radical performance enhancement approaches.  Most major and many smaller manufacturing companies have adopted the popular performance improvement initiatives. These companies are now striving to achieve the next level of performance enhancement at the system or enterprise level and require a better understanding of their business processes and knowledge intensive operations. This understanding needs to be achieved rapidly, cost effectively and in a readily communicable and quantifiable form to allow analysis and ongoing re-analysis within the volatile industrial environment. The proposed methodology achieves this through the identification, communication, understanding and analysis of the internal and external interactions and dependencies of the facility.

T1  - Developing information products using Quality Management
AN  - 867259817
AB  - In regards to information design, research provides high-level suggestions on how to learn and interact with customers to obtain their desired requirements; but specifics on an approach to eliciting and controlling measurable requirements throughout the development process are not explored. In other areas of design, such an approach already exists: Quality Management, which has successfully improved processes and provided measurements for improvement in order to decrease errors and increase productivity. This dissertation analyzes the applicability of quality management tools to the process of developing information products.    The methodology involved two phases. In the initial phase, the researcher had the task of improving a company's benefits enrollment package for two groups. A Traditional Group used the currently accepted best practices in technical communication, performing a heuristic evaluation and a usability test to determine what changes to make in the existing package. This group focuses on the existing benefits enrollment package. In contrast, a Quality Management Group developed a benefits enrollment package using quality management tools, gathering quantifiable functional requirements early in the design and continuing throughout the process. The researcher prepared a revised benefits enrollment package for both groups, and the results of the studies were compared.    According to the usability analysis, the Traditional Group showed considerable improvement from the original package to the redesigned package. However, the Quality Management Group showed even greater improvements in several areas, suggesting the potential viability of this method in information design.    Future studies should focus on testing the effectiveness of this process on other types of information products. For the products that are successful, information designers could greatly benefit in learning how to use quality management tools to provide more precise and measurable information products.

T1  - Social constructionism and personal constructivism: Getting the business owner's view on the role of sex and gender
AN  - 356965450
AB  - Purpose - While the entrepreneurship and small business research literature has tended to portray women as lesser than men in identifying the differences between them, little research has looked at how gender is construed in business ownership. The purpose of this paper is to provide a new focus, examining how male and female business owners construe each other. Design/methodology/approach - The research employs George Kelly's personal construct theory and repertory grids to examine the constructs associated with male and female business owners. Findings - It is found that there are many constructs used to describe business owners and, counter to predictions from some of the literature review, few differences between the way in which male and female business owners are construed. The paper offers explanations as to why so few differences are found. Research limitations/implications - The sample is limited to just one area of Britain and the businesses had all been established in the last three years. This will influence the generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - This paper is able to offer research evidence to demonstrate that male and female business owners do not construe male and female business owners differently.

T1  - ON BECOMING COURAGEOUS: PERSONAL CONSTRUCT THERAPY IN A CASE OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, FIBROMYALGIA AND OTHER COMORBIDITIES / CAMINO HACIA EL CORAJE: TERAPIA DE CONSTRUCTOS PERSONALES EN UN CASO DE DEPRESIÓN MAYOR, FIBROMIALGIA Y OTRAS COMORBILIDADES
AN  - 2231326876
AB  - In this article the case of Sara is presented. She is diagnosed with fibromyalgia, depression and other comorbid disorders. Psychologically, one of her main difficulties lies in putting limits to others' demands on her which damages her relationship with loved ones and also with herself. Looking at her personal constructs, it is apparent that for her satisfying her needs is not compatible with responding to others' demands. She ends up handing over in order to keep up with her self image of being a good person which is a key stone in her sense of identity, a core construct. The brief format of personal construct therapy carried with her dealt with this dilemma and some significant changes occurred which were maintained at the follow-up.
Se presenta el caso de Sara, una mujer con fibromialgia, depresión, y otras comorbilidades. A nivel psicológico, una de sus mayores dificultades estriba en poner límites a los demás. Ello perjudica la relación que mantiene tanto con sus seres queridos como con ella misma. Analizando sus constructos personales con la técnica de rejilla y la autocaracterización se observa que vive como incompatibles la satisfacción de sus necesidades y el acceder a las demandas de los demás. Termina por ceder con el fin de preservar para sí misma una imagen de buena persona que resulta central en su sentido de identidad y nuclear en su sistema de constructos. La terapia de constructos personales realizada en un formato breve aborda este dilema y se producen algunos cambios significativos que perduran al seguimiento.

T1  - Phases of Organ Integration and Conflict in a Transplant Recipient: A Longitudinal Study Using a Diary
AN  - 807479839; 18756315
AB  - In this paper the results from a research project on self-perception and psychological processing following transplantation of solid organs are presented. A diary at the individual case level was introduced to generate a longitudinal analysis. In the following paper we describe an evaluation of the entries of a single patient following a living donor kidney transplant. Conflicts in the relationship between the transplant recipient and the donor, who is also his wife, are clearly evident, and these are interpreted as incorporation conflicts in light of current psychoanalytic theory.

T1  - Complementary Oppositions in the Construal of Self and Others
AN  - 231975163; 18521753
AB  - In the construal of self and others, highly diverse, idiosyncratic, and evocative adjectival terms were manifested as contrasting, opposite terms for a set of supplied constructs rather than conventional antonyms. These "personal contrasts" are seen as a neglected companion to George Kelly's (The Psychology of Personal Constructs, 1955) conception of "personal constructs". These construct/contrast pairings are seen as representing connected, complementary aspects of an essential unity such that each side of a pair informs the meaning of the other. This complementarity, long recognized in an extensive literature on polar, dichotomous, and binary pairs in the physical and social worlds, is seen as having applicability to many descriptive adjectives. It is suggested that adjectival complementary pairings often involve unique associative linkages, the tracing of which could prove fruitful for understanding the construal of self and others.

T1  - A knowledge engineering approach to developing e-libraries for mobile learning
AN  - 218247412
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative approach that is proposed for developing e-libraries with metadata to meet the need of training observation and classification skills in a mobile learning environment. Design/methodology/approach - A knowledge engineering approach is proposed to assist teachers in defining metadata of e-libraries to meet the need of training observation and classification skills. Based on the innovative approach, an e-library of butterfly and ecology has been developed. Moreover, an experiment was conducted from March-April 2007 on the science course "Butterfly and Ecology" at an elementary school in Taiwan. There were two teachers and 35 students participated in the experiment. Findings - Experimental results showed that the e-library developed with the innovative approach is able to effectively support the training of observation and classification skills for elementary school students. Research limitations/implications - Currently, the innovative approach has only been applied to the training of observation and classification knowledge. Further studies will be needed to assist teachers in defining metadata of e-libraries for other educational objectives, such as "analysis" (the ability to separate material or concepts into component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood), "synthesis" (the ability to put parts together to form a new whole) and "evaluation" (the ability to judge the value of material for a given purpose). Originality/value - With the innovative approach, personalized supports can be provided as a guide for students' learning. Moreover, students are allowed to face the real objects with technology-rich supports during the learning process.

AB  - The development of any field of scientific inquiry involves global scholarly conversations. While we agree with Meyer's (2006) key tenets, we extend his discussion of Asia management scholars' need for self-confidence by exploring the role of context, collaboration, and constraints in global scholarly discourse. In particular, we highlight the need for consideration of multi-level context, the development of theories that are good for local stakeholders' management practice and technology-facilitated and super-institutional collaboration. We illustrate our arguments for the development, legitimization, and institutionalization of Asia Pacific management research with examples from management and other scholarly disciplines in Australia, China, Europe, and North America.

T1  - Caring for the community: An exploratory comparison of waste reduction behaviour by British and Brazilian consumers
AN  - 203702199
AB  - The symbolic and social roles of waste are explored through a small sample of UK and Brazilian consumers from urban and rural communities. These findings are relevant in highlighting the importance of considering socio-cultural differences in waste policies. Following an ontologically realist and epistemologically interpretive perspective on waste a series of semi-structured interviews was conducted in English and Portuguese. While Brazilian interviewees view waste as opportunity, their discourses reproduce the inequalities among and between their communities. UK participants view waste as burdensome, but demonstrate more awareness of their rights as citizens within their communities. The study is exploratory and future work should address a broader range of respondents within communities across different cultures, demographic and socio-economic circumstances. Ideas generated from the study have both specific and general relevance beyond the Brazilian and UK communities. Marketing has the capacity to help advance the establishment of more effective environmentally friendly forms of consumption and disposal. The paper presents a fresh perspective on developing and developed country community waste reduction behaviours through the examination of waste meanings for individual consumers.

T1  - What Makes for Top Team Success? A Study to Identify Factors Associated with Successful Performance of Senior Management Teams
AN  - 207654589
AB  - Within organisations there is a growth in the use of team development interventions designed to enhance effective team performance. This had been particularly notable in senior management and leadership teams. However this development has not been underpinned by rigorous, organisationally based research (West and Slater, 1995) and the research which has been undertaken has not adequately addressed the issues (Lorsch, 1989; Higgs et al., 2005). It is therefore important to undertake systematic empirical research to underpin the validity of such interventions. The relationship between top team performance and organisational performance was given a clear focus and a sense of direction as long ago as the 1980s by Hambrick and Mason's 'Upper Echelon Theory' (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). This promoted a stream of demographically based research, but the results have been limited and sometimes contradictory (Pettigrew, 1992; Higgs et al., 2005), in part as a result of the absence of direct data relating to the impact of teams on performance. Also both team and group research have failed to analyse the importance of the mix of personalities and team processes in achieving high performance (Higgs, 1999). This paper presents the results of a research programme involving fifty-four senior management teams using direct data. The research assesses the importance of the mix of personalities in a team and the processes they employ in working together, in determining performance outcomes. The results highlight the benefits of successful team processes, many of which relate also to Higgs and Dulewicz's studies of board processes (1997). This finding indicates the potential value of process intervention as a means of developing team performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - "Personal excellence" as a value for health professionals: a patient's perspective
AN  - 229701150
AB  - To bring to the attention of health care professionals a framework and set of ideas for conceptualising a typical patient's experience and ways to respond out of a subjective inner quality called personal excellence. This paper essays the viewpoint of the author on a selection of his experiences as a patient over 19 hospital admissions during his lifetime. He integrates these findings with his understanding of personal construct psychology, the psychology of change and the Greek philosophical concept of "arete " or excellence. The paper offers a theory that patients experience three kinds of emotions or anguish when admitted to hospitals called threat, fear and anxiety. These three ways of interpreting an experience of change are based on the diagnostic constructs of transition from the psychology of personal constructs or the psychology of change. The paper asserts that a holistic approach is more likely to be delivered by health care staff with a calling than those who are merely doing a job or pursuing a career. This paper is significant in that it draws on authentic experiences of a patient that are conceptualised into a coherent framework and linked to a well-accepted theory within the science of psychology. Further it offers an alternative to essays on quality that are confined to objective features only. It offers a way, via the philosophical concept of "arete " to tap into the subjective attitudinal dimension of quality that is often the lever or more often the impediment to enabling quality improvement programmes to be effective.

T1  - Factors that affect the design and implementation of team-based performance measurement systems
AN  - 218373099
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the factors that enable and/or constrain the design and implementation of team-based performance measurement systems. This research study departed from an industrially-led project. The research strategies used (i.e. case studies, industrial workshops and action research) are suited to the applied and empirical nature of the study. The paper reviews the existing literature on team performance measurement. It then presents the findings based on a exploratory phase and a theory refinement phase. The results of this study suggest that there are eleven factors affecting the design and implementation of TPMS. It also suggests that these factors are inter-related with each other. As a result, the impact of one factor can reduce and even eliminate the impact of other factors.

T1  - The marketing/creativity interface: a case study of a visual artist
AN  - 236378048
AB  - This paper aims to contribute to an understanding of the marketing/creativity interface in the visual arts at the level of the individual artist. Proceeding, broadly speaking, from a constructivist perspective and using a qualitative case study approach, it examines a visual artist's personal construction of her creative and business work. The analysis highlights the significance of emotional, cognitive, spiritual and physical processes for the artist's positioning, process, and products, as well as her difficulties with promotion and pricing issues. It was seen, following Fillis (2004), that, at the level of an individual artist, her work may be not only product-oriented but self-oriented. It therefore behoves artists and their agents to be able to offer appropriately distinguishing promotional accounts of the artist's artistic identity, process and work based on a deep self-reflexive awareness and understanding by the artist of her own creative practice.

T1  - Self-discrepancies in bipolar disorder: Comparison of manic, depressed, remitted and normal participants
AN  - 218672159; 16368026
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the role of self-discrepancies in different phases of bipolar disorder (manic-depression). METHOD AND DESIGN: Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in three groups, currently depressed, currently manic or hypomanic, and currently in remission, together with healthy control participants, were administered a modified version of Higgins' Selves Questionnaire. Consistencies between the self-actual, self-ideal and self-ought representations were calculated, together with consistencies between the self-actual representation and the believed views of generalized others about the self. RESULTS: In contrast to all other groups, bipolar depressed patients showed marked discrepancies between their self-actual and self-ideal representations, and between their self-actual and self-ought representations. Manic or hypomanic patients showed higher self-actual:self-ideal consistency than non-patient controls. The differences between the depressed participants and the other groups appeared to be accounted for by their very negative self-actual descriptions. Participants in all four groups showed high levels of consistency between self-perceptions and the believed perceptions of others about the self. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that beliefs about the self differ between different phases of bipolar disorder and are consistent with the hypothesis that the manic phase involves active avoidance of discrepancies between the self and self-ideals.

T1  - Some Suggestions for Mapping Organizational Members' Sense of Fit
AN  - 196889349
AB  - Despite its importance in the organizational behavior literature, person-organization (P-O) fit remains an elusive construct. One reason for this is the lack of research about organizational members' own sense of their P-O fit. In this paper we discuss the criteria required of suitable research tools to explore this domain. Drawing on arguments from the cognition literature, we argue that storytelling and causal mapping techniques are suitable for exploring organizational members' sense of fit. We conclude with a short example of the method in action and a discussion of some of the practical issues that researchers will face. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluating research for use in practice: what criteria do specialist nurses use?
AN  - 232498499
AB  - This paper reports a study identifying the criteria chosen by nurses to evaluate whether to use research in practice. This work is part of a larger project on the process of research use by nurses. Prescriptive models of research utilization direct practitioners to evaluate a range of criteria to assess the fit of the research to current practice. Criteria relating to the research, task and nursing context are specified, but it is not known whether nurses use these criteria in practice. Three different groups of nurse specialists from a number of health care providers in the North West of England were studied. The specialists were involved in a series of meetings at a local university to construct evidence-based policy recommendations for practice. The discussion was analysed to identify the evaluation criteria they used to assess what should be done in the practical setting. Three sets of evaluative criteria were identified relating to the research, the task and the fit of the task with the nursing context, and included relevance and quality of the research, effectiveness, practicality, effort and the impact of the task on client and staff, feasibility and fit with the status quo, and the availability of nursing control and feedback from practice. Criteria were domain-, task- and context-specific. Three frames of reference for decisions relating to the use of research are identified: the debate between efficiency and effectiveness in health care, the difficulties of risk management and the responsibility for risk, and research use as a strategy for control in contested arenas. These frames of reference reflect how nurses are judged in a political and organizational context. Attempts to influence research uptake need to take into account how research is perceived and evaluated by practitioners and how it serves their purposes.

T1  - Social Cognitive Effects on Information and Technology Use
AN  - 213516582
AB  - Researchers in the past decade have been actively investigating technology use and disuse among conventional and communications technologies, but have largely ignored information use. Passive technologies merely gather information to inform a human decision maker, which makes it difficult to determine if the technology user makes use of the information. However, recent advancements in expert systems technology have enabled the concurrent investigation of technology and information use because expert systems generate explicit courses of action for users to follow. This empirical study integrated social cognitive theory to extend the DeLone and McLean model. A regression analysis indicated differences between technology and information use. Further, social influences and attitudes were found to interact relative to information use resulting in a non-linear relationship such that when attitudes are poor and social pressures are high, people use the technology but ignore the information. We also found that the EDSS use was negatively related to human-induced errors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The preliminary findings are reported of a review of the contents of the British Journal of Psychology 1904-2003 undertaken to mark the journal's centenary. This identifies (a) the top 11 categories of paper published and their patterns of distribution, (b) an apparent change in the nature of papers published after 1983, (c) the overall pattern of category-introduction, showing a dramatic change in 1965 and (d) a provisional typology of the principal patterns of distribution over time. Major conceptual and practical problems arising in the categorization of papers, and their implications, are discussed. Some reflections are offered on the possible value of research of this kind and on the nature of the journal itself. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - High-tech corporate branding: lessons for market research in the next decade
AN  - 213439390
AB  - Established corporate brand research has two significant weaknesses. The first is the lack of empirically based research behind the theory. The second is the "over-quantification" of research methods to deal with marketing topics concerning consumers" beliefs, perceptions and values. Additionally, high-tech corporate brands are rarely the basis of brand research. This study explores consumer reactions to technical brands to draw inferences and build more effective brand strategies. The mobile phone market is selected to represent a high-tech consumer market. In-depth interviews guided by the principal of personal construct theory and using the laddering technique (Kelly, G.A., The Psychology of Personal Constructs, Norton, New York, NY, 1955) are used. Two polar groups of consumers are selected as respondents. The findings reveal three shared key dimensions of brand value that are relevant in this type of market. The nature and relative importance of these dimensions are outlined. The evidence indicates that perceptions of corporate "credibility" are based on emotional and experiential associations rather than on more obvious, rational ones.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluation of multicultural factors from elicited customer requirements for new product development
AN  - 2262569519
AB  - Globalisation has been characterised as one of the recent trends in new product development (NPD), in which multicultural factors, in particular, dominate the initial step of product development. Moreover, the voice of customers has been widely accepted as an important source of input to subsequently obtain design metrics and specifications in the early stage of product concept design. For this purpose, customer requirements elicitation and management will determine the success level of an organisation's NPD and benchmarking. Hence, multicultural factors are the most difficult issues for organisations to address, even with the assistance of today's advanced computer systems. It has, accordingly, been one of the future directions in NPD. However, in practice, there are few successful or effective techniques available for the evaluation of multicultural factors in customer requirements. This paper aims at realising a prototype system that combines the strengths of the laddering technique and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network for customer requirements acquisition and multicultural factors evaluation. The performance of the prototype system was illustrated using a case study on mobile hand phone design. The results are discussed in detail.

T1  - Designing performance measurement systems for teams: Theory and practice
AN  - 212065381
AB  - This paper reports on an industrially led research project, supported by the UK Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), which set out to tackle an increasingly pressing issue for organizations - how to measure and manage the performance of teams. In spite of the current interest in performance measurement and teamwork in industry, little evidence of team performance measurement systems (TPMS) was seen. Thus, started the authors' journey into looking for a way to help companies to measure and manage team performance. The purpose of this paper is to take the reader through the investigations, with an emphasis on the analysis of current practice and research on TPMS. It describes a typology for TPMS design and identifies the gaps of current TPMS approaches. The paper concludes by claiming that a new approach to facilitate organizations design TPMS is required and by presenting a generic framework for TPMS. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Competencies: A new sector
AN  - 215392254
AB  - This paper outlines the processes involved in the development of a competency based framework for use by middle managers of three-star Irish hotels within rooms division and the food and beverage department. Secondary research provides an overview of existing generic competency models. Competency models and frameworks have been applied and customized across a broad range of industry sectors. The need for an innovative and fresh approach to HRM within the Irish hotel sector is addressed. The primary research is conducted among three-star hotels nationwide, giving equal representation to all regions of Ireland. Job analysis techniques are used as the basis for the primary research. The research is conducted among general managers and middle managers of three-star hotels. It is envisaged that the outcomes of this project will help assist managers in three-star hotels to benchmark their most important role challenges at a middle managerial level against others in similar roles.

AB  - Many companies have found that the presumed benefits of organizational change initiatives, such as TQM or team working, have not been forthcoming because managers have failed to support those developments through the simultaneous adaptation of the company's performance evaluation and control systems. This paper reports new research sponsored by the EPSRC which has developed a prototype practitioner methodology to help managers in their role as organizational designers to critically appraise and diagnose current organizational control practices and, where appropriate, intervene.

AB  - Management researchers, over the last 15 years or so have shown a great deal of interest in the study of managerial cognitions and have started exploring the relationships among mind, management and organisation.   This paper first details a visual cards sorting (VCS) methodology which has been found appropriate to tap managerial cognitions. To explain the operationalisation of this methodology, empirical results from a cross-national comparative HRM study are later presented. Finally, implications of the study and limitations of the VCS technique are highlighted.

T1  - Competency management in the British civil service
AN  - 234405273
AB  - Competency management is an idea that was developed in the private sector and transposed to the public sector during the 1990s. First this article examines the concept of competency-based management, its claimed advantages over traditional approaches to personnel management and the problems associated with its use. Second, it describes and analyzes the extent of its use in the British civil service based on an empirical survey of 130 civil service departments and agencies carried out in February 2000. Third, it looks in detail at the way that five civil service organizations have developed, and are using, holistic approaches to competency management. Finally, it concludes that although the approach to introducing competency management has, up to now, been fragmented, ad hoc and pragmatic central government pressure to adopt benchmarking and Investors in People personnel strategies is resulting in a more holistic practice of competency-based management throughout the civil service.

T1  - The supplier-retailer relationship in the context of strategic groups
AN  - 210920250
AB  - The individual analysis of one supply sector is extended to that of another, thereby permitting a more detailed examination, not only of the bilateral relationships that exist between the supply and the retail sectors, but also of the influence that such relationships have on the client-retailers' loyalties to, or mobility among, their different supply firms.

AB  - Hopper outlines how to use a psychoanalysis tool, known as a repertory grid, as a reframing strategy in a teacher preparation course, and shows how the repertory grid enables preservice teachers to articulate their personal beliefs about teaching.  The grids offer ways for the student to evaluate physical education teachers and coaches that the student encountered in junior high, high school and/or college.

T1  - Caring behaviors of nurses as perceived by patients and nurses
AN  - 304512613
AB  - This qualitative paper used a phenomenological-existential approach to study patients' and nurses' perceptions of caring behaviors or characteristics of nurses. Dr. Jean Watson's (1985/1988) theory of the Science of Caring provided the guiding force behind this research. An extensive literature review is presented in three sections: Caring as construct, variable, and perceived.    Personal interviews were conducted with 12 participants, six patients and six nurses. Significant Statements were extracted from transcripts and the meanings of the statements were formulated into three themes: "When the nurse does...," "When the nurse is...," "When the nurse says...." A fourth theme developed from statements justifying the reasons nurses may be displaying non-caring behaviors, "Because the nurse...." Each theme is supported by sub-themes, significant statements, and participants' stories.    Finally, the study's findings are discussed and applied to nursing theory, nursing education, nursing practice, and nursing research. Suggestions are given for future studies in nursing research.

T1  - The role of mental models in control theory: Understanding cognitive factors influencing the behaviors of salespeople
AN  - 212181262
AB  - A study extends control theory by exploring the referents that salespeople use to interpret their performance and, subsequently, adjust their behaviors if performance is deemed inadequate. While scholars have long relied on referents and control theory to explain motivated behavior, research has just recently begun to investigate the sources of referents that are integral to such advances. It is proposed that referents are inexorably intertwined with salespersons' mental models, which are engaged during sales episodes. Integration of organizational and employee-based control systems seems justified based on contemporary workplace concerns.

T1  - Socially Shared Emotional Experiences Vs. Emotional Experiences Kept Secret: Differential Characteristics and Consequences
AN  - 848851481
AB  - Two studies investigated differences between emotional events that are socially shared and those that are kept secret. It was hypothesized that emotional intensity, type of emotion, appraisal, and display differentiate between the two types of events. Also, it was predicted that keeping an emotional memory secret would affect both the amount and the content of related mental rumination. Contrary to the prediction, overall intensity failed to differentiate shared and nonshared events, but qualitative aspects did. Consistent with the hypotheses, nonshared events showed greater shame and guilt, increased appraisal of personal responsibility, and more dissimulation of emotional display. Shared and nonshared memories did not differ in frequency of mental rumination, but nonshared events involved greater search for meaning and efforts to understand what happened. The implications of these results for future research on emotional secrecy and social sharing of emotion are discussed.

AB  - A qualitative study based on the first-hand accounts of students in higher education was conducted.  Participants were encouraged to explain, in their own terms, their own help-seeking behaviour.  The focus for their explanations was 'help-seeking from academic staff'.  The aim of the study was to construct a culturally sensitive account of barriers to help-seeking in a student population.  The discussion focuses on how studies of this kind might complement and extend what is already known about help-seeking in the extant literature.

T1  - Escolhas Estratégicas e Estilo Cognitivo: um Estudo com Pequenas Empresas
AN  - 1449477770
AB  - This study describes the cognitive structure adopted by small firms' owners and managers in the strategic management of their businesses. The influence of respondents' cognitive styles over strategic decisions was explored, as well as the role exerted by environmental turbulence on strategic choices. A careful exploration of Miles and Snow's (1978) taxonomy of strategic types and Kirton's (1976) Adaptation-Innovation theory suggested that a prospector strategy may be preferred by individuals whose psychological characteristics indicate an innovative behaviour. On the other hand, defensive strategies seem to be most attractive to individuals who prefer an adaptive cognitive style. The research method involved a set of nineteen interviews with small firms' owner-managers in two types of environemt: one highly dynamic and competitive in terms of techonlogy, and another less turbulent. An additional sample of fourteen entrepreneurs allowed a more detailed exploration of the association between environmental turbulence, cognitive style, and strategic choices. Results indicated that there are good reasons to believe that environmental turbulence is associated with strategic choices, while cognitive preferences do not seem to be associated with strategy formation.

T1  - 360 degree ratings: An analysis of assumptions and a research agenda for evaluating their validity
AN  - 199453862; 01596886
AB  - An article argues that assumptions surrounding 360-degree ratings should be examined:  most notably, the assumptions that different ratings sources have relatively unique perspectives on performance and multiple rating sources provide incremental validity over the individual sources.  Two research directions are suggested for learning more about why different organizational levels tend to disagree in their ratings and thus how to improve interpretation of 360-degree ratings.  Regarding the second assumption, it is argued that the hypothesis that low-to-moderate across organizational level interrater agreement is actually a positive result might be resurrected, reflecting different levels' raters each making reasonably valid performance judgments but on partially different aspects of job performance.  Three approaches to testing this hypothesis are offered.

T1  - Behaviours in organization: Chinese world views and perceptions of cross-cultural differences. A study of Hong Kong Chinese working in Canada
AN  - 304389526
AB  - This study inquired into the lived experience of the Hong Kong Chinese in Canada and captured snapshots of their perceptions of cross-cultural differences in organizational behaviour. To provide a base for study, I examined literature on organizational behaviour from the cross-cultural and the Chinese dimensions. To conceptualise how people perceive the world, I reviewed literature on the personal-construct theory and the schema theory.    The study used a qualitative mode of enquiry, with the researcher as an instrument to collect data through the in-depth interview and the repertory-grid methods. The participants, 8 men and 2 women, were either degree-holders or professionals with work experience in the service sectors in both Hong Kong and Canada. The study extracted their world views, which shape their interpretation of reality, from their narratives and work experience in both cultures. I identified 7 meta-narratives shaping the unique world view that differentiate them from Canadians at work; these meta-narratives dealt with: existence, achievement, work, conflict, power, relationship and communication. I also identified 4 major dimensions in modus operandi between these two cultures: planning, cooperation, leadership and controlling.    I adopted the phenomenological-hermeneutic approach to analyse and thematise the data collected through interviews. I also explored through the repertory-grid method the participants' constructs of the role-holders in organizations between these two cultures. The grid data were computed by the Focus programme. These two sets of results were compared and triangulated to increase the study's academic rigour.    The evidence shows that the Chinese perceived significant differences between themselves and Canadians in many dimensions of organizational behaviour. These differences obviously reflected these 2 cultures' underlining meta-narratives--the Chinese perceived Canadians as self-rather than organization-oriented, over-optimistic and carefree, uncommitted assertive, equalitarian, too frank and straightforward competitive in dealing with conflicts and intolerant to inequality. Clearly, their cultural perspective creates difficulty for Chinese working in Canada and Canadians or Western management specialists and educators attempting to work in Chinese societies.    The study concludes with implications for practice for people who work across the cultural line with Chinese, with recommendations on ways to enhance cultural understanding, and with directions for further research.

T1  - An inventory of personal constructs for information systems project risk researchers
AN  - 859065795
AB  - This paper explores the application of personal construct elicitation techniques to the identification of the situational factors that managers of bespoke information system development projects take into account when planning new projects for new customers. It is shown that the personal constructs elicited reflect most of the contingency variables and risk-drivers mentioned in the information systems development literature, but also include some situational characteristics not addressed in this literature. It is concluded that personal construct elicitation techniques have a valuable role to play in information systems development research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A closer look at self-image in male foster care adolescents
AN  - 215273990; 8560323; 02701463
AB  - Using the Offer Self-Image Questionnaire, this study attempted to determine the differences between 58 male adolescents in foster care and their peers in the normal population and to establish if there are characteristics of the adolescents' background or foster care experience related to specific domains of self-image. Characteristics from foster care history included number of placements and length of time at the current placement. Individual background characteristics included race, educational achievement, and age. Foster care youths had lower family self-image and emotional health and higher social self-image when compared with the normative population. Lower scores on several domains of self-image were associated with being younger, being white, having lower academic achievement, having more placements, and staying at the current placement for a longer time. The implications of these findings for foster care placement decisions are discussed.

T1  - Women's view of pubs: A study of methods
AN  - 215863477; 01001079
AB  - Customers' experience of service encounters remains an area blessed with a rich folklore but little fundamental understanding.  A pilot study  explored women's experiences of public houses, and used idographic methods on a small sample of middle-class women: role repertory grids, critical-incident questionnaires, individual comparatively unstructured interviews, and group focus interviews.  Group interviews were most useful for coming quickly to a consensus picture, and the critical incident questionnaires allowed extreme examples of good and bad practice to be explored.  It is concluded that there is considerable variation in what women are looking to find in pubs, but that they agree on their dislike of male-dominated atmospheres in which they are harassed or made to feel unwelcome.

T1  - Training evaluation: A procedure for validating an organization's investment in training
AN  - 215394636; 00662564
AB  - At a time when industrial expense, particularly training budgets, is under great pressure, it is of great importance that training be carefully focused to ensure that organizations obtain the maximum benefit.  Kirkpatrick (1960) described 4 levels of strategy in the evaluation of training: 1.  reaction, 2.  learning, 3.  application, and 4.  benefit.  These widely accepted procedures have been applied only at level one (student reaction forms).  Many researchers have questioned the value of this part-application of an evaluation strategy.  A simple model for the analysis of organizational deficiency in training is developed.  This new system of training effectiveness evaluation not only forms the basis of individual analysis, but also allows group deficiencies to be explored over time.  The method based on self-perceived skill gap measurement allows the monitoring of skills management at individual departmental and organizational levels and gives management, for the first time, a control measure to which skills management budgets can be compared.
