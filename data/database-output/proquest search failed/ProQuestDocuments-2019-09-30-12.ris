T1  - Effective team onboarding in Agile software development: techniques and goals
AN  - 2263716454
AB  - Context: It is not uncommon for a new team member to join an existing Agile software development team, even after development has started. This new team member faces a number of challenges before they are integrated into the team and can contribute productively to team progress. Ideally, each newcomer should be supported in this transition through an effective team onboarding program, although prior evidence suggests that this is challenging for many organisations. Objective: We seek to understand how Agile teams address the challenge of team onboarding in order to inform future onboarding design. Method: We conducted an interview survey of eleven participants from eight organisations to investigate what onboarding activities are common across Agile software development teams. We also identify common goals of onboarding from a synthesis of literature. A repertory grid instrument is used to map the contributions of onboarding techniques to onboarding goals. Results: Our study reveals that a broad range of team onboarding techniques, both formal and informal, are used in practice. It also shows that particular techniques that have high contributions to a given goal or set of goals. Conclusions: In presenting a set of onboarding goals to consider and an evidence-based mechanism for selecting techniques to achieve the desired goals it is expected that this study will contribute to better-informed onboarding design and planning. An increase in practitioner awareness of the options for supporting new team members is also an expected outcome.

T1  - Olfactory description for refined linseed oils for paints: Characterization for reconstructing material and craft knowledge in paintmaking
AN  - 2198409071
AB  - The aim of this study is to formulate an olfactory description for refined linseed oils, for paintmaking purposes, in order to redevelop and articulate material and craft knowledge relevant to cultural heritage. By using the repertory grid method, common in food and beverage sensory consumer analysis, different types of refined linseed oils available on professional market are examined regarding odor qualities by traditional Swedish architectural painting professionals (32 working or studying painters and paintmakers). With semantic analysis, statistical processing, and principal component analysis, an olfactory description is defined. The analysis reveal that the odor qualities of the linseed oils can be correlated to the types of linseed oils and hence their heating temperatures. Raw, heated, high‐temperature boiled, and vacuum‐boiled linseed oils can be verbally distinguished by typical odor qualities ranging from for instance mild and grassy to pungent and decaying. The olfactory description will be used in further work for sensory examinations, combined with natural sciences and craft sciences to verbalize experiences of linseed oil with different film‐forming characteristics in order to regain lost knowledge concerning linseed oil (anticorrosive) paints for maintenance and conservation of historic buildings and constructions.Practical applicationsAn olfactory description enables traditional architectural painting professionals to judge and discuss linseed oil qualities in traditional architectural painting and paintmaking, for redeveloping tangible and intangible craft skills. Sensory analysis methods access new tools for cultural heritage studies and enables craft persons to train their attention to odors as rapid quality indicators for different types of oils for various outdoor building or iron/steel construction painting purposes.

T1  - The bigger picture: young children's perception of fatness in the context of other physical differences
AN  - 2099922452
AB  - BackgroundNegative obesity stereotypes and anti‐fat attitudes have been observed in children from age three. It is uncertain whether this is specific to fatness or generalizable to other visible differences.ObjectivesTo determine whether young children base decisions about qualities in others and friendship choices more on fatness than other visible differences between people.MethodsUsing a personal construct theory approach, 85 children (mean age 5.7, 42 girls) completed a simple repertory grid. The children were asked about differences (constructs) between four illustrations (elements) that showed children as healthy weight, fat, the opposite gender and in a wheelchair. Children were also asked about friendship with the illustrated children and self‐image preferences. Their answers were grouped using thematic analysis.ResultsThe fat, opposite gender and wheelchair‐bound characters were equally chosen by children as different to the standard character. When identifying differences, fatness or body shape was referred to significantly less than gender or being in a wheelchair. Children were more likely to reject an opposite gender character as a friend, or as someone they would like to be, than to reject the fat character. Only one child, themselves overweight, voiced strong anti‐fat attitudes.ConclusionsApparent negativity towards fatness is fostered by failure to consider other visible differences and by children's ‘like me’ peer preferences. It was less desirable in the eyes of most 5‐year old girls to be a boy than to be fat. This offers some reassurance to those working to improve children's health literacy in obesity.

T1  - <i>“It’s Not Something I Chose You Know”</i>: Making Sense of Pedophiles’ Sexual Interest in Children and the Impact on Their Psychosexual Identity
AN  - 2085398226
AB  - Sexual interest in children is one of the most strongly predictive of the known risk factors for sexual reconviction. It is an important aspect of risk assessment to identify the presence of such interest, and an important task for treatment providers to address such a sexual interest where it is present. It has been argued that understanding pedophiles’ deviant sexual interest in children can enhance risk assessment, management, and treatment planning. This research study aims to explore the phenomenology of deviant sexual interest in children, the impact it has on pedophilic offenders’ identities, and their views on the treatability of that interest. The study used semistructured interviews and repertory grids to make sense of participants’ experiences. The results revealed three superordinate themes: “‘living’ with a deviant sexual interest,” “relational sexual self,” and “possible and feared sexual self.” The analysis unpacks these themes and repertory grid analysis is used to explore a subset of participants’ identities in more detail. The results reveal that there needs to be an acceptance from both client and therapist that their sexual interest in children may never go away. Through this acceptance, clients could work on enhancing sexual self-regulation, recognizing their triggers, and so managing their sexual thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Implications for treatment are also discussed.

AB  - The conference deliberated upon the following broad themes, containing both conceptual and empirical papers about recent and emerging developments: understanding consumer behavior in current marketing environment, where organizations need to explore and understand consumers for valuable insights for the development of new products/services and innovative marketing communications; role of social media and digital marketing in playing a profound role in influencing the consumer behavior, making the market place dynamic with success of any firm dependent on designing effective means to reach its customers through innovative technologies; culture, sub-cultural factors, society, reference groups and mass media that can influence consumers; and role of marketing strategy in using some new marketing tools for creating richer customer values and long-term consumer – brand relationships.

The authors have used interview techniques with industry representatives along with repertory grid method to demonstrate that the concept of customer experience applies in an organizational buying situation as well and leads to the formation of an experiential value, which in turn guides the purchase intent.

[...]the sixth paper by Vinitha Bhatia explores factors affecting consumers’ attitude toward counterfeit fashion products and their effects on purchase intention.

T1  - Behavioural modification framework to address wastage in household electricity consumption
AN  - 2013520609
AB  - Household electricity wastage poses a sustainability issue. Ergonomic interventions that prevent wastage through technological innovations are expensive and complex, making consumers unwilling to adopt them. The study aimed to investigate the motivations and impediments in avoiding electricity wastage. Thirteen Repertory Grid interviews were conducted on household electricity users relating to the behaviour of those living with them. The key motivational themes found were altruistic and egoistic reasons while the impediments were perceived behavioural control, hedonism and self-efficacy. Based on the research findings, a behavioural modification framework was developed to encourage consumers to adopt a higher level of responsible electricity practice through the following suggested interventions - (1) reframing sustainability from 'future-for-others' to 'present-for-us', (2) clarifying responsible consumption and (3) performance feedback. The research identified the key motivations and impediments of being a responsible household electricity user and provided a framework to encourage a higher responsibility level.Practitioner Summary: Household electricity wastage poses sustainability issue: excess CO2 & high costs. We developed a mindset changing behavioural modification framework. We investigated HFE issues: motivations & impediments of avoiding the wastage, i.e. altruistic, egoistic, behavioural control, hedonism & self-efficacy. The framework provides governments insights into strategies to address the wastage.

T1  - Inclusive and exclusive masculinities in physical education: a Scottish case study
AN  - 2015503932
AB  - This research examines how adolescent males (ages 16-17 years) construct and experience their masculine identities within the context of physical education (PE). A class of 23 boys and 3 girls from a state secondary school in Scotland were observed over a period of 3 months. During the third month, five of the observed pupils volunteered to take part in a conversation with the lead researcher which was guided by their participation in a repertory grid task. The same five participants also took part in a one-to-one semi-structured interview. The analysis of the evidence revealed that the adolescent pupils internalised and performed an orthodox form of masculinity that centred on strength, pain tolerance and the policing of others. More inclusive masculinities appeared to be emerging, however, the hypermasculine and public nature of the PE environment made it very difficult for the pupils to freely adopt or perform these alternative, more inclusive forms of masculinity. Additionally, pupils who did perform traits associated with inclusive masculinity often exhibited a high degree of social and physical capital. In order to facilitate a culture where all individuals feel free to express their gendered identities, teachers are encouraged to recognise, promote and celebrate multiple masculinities. This could create a safer learning environment for pupils and help prevent identities from being 'destroyed' in PE.

T1  - Cognition of a successful professional: a study on the mental constructs of millennials
AN  - 1979918523
AB  - This article addresses the development of the first qualitative stage of a broader research project that seeks to construct and validate a semantic differential on career adapted for millennials. To this end, the aim of this work was to elucidate which mental constructs represent a successful career for millennials, also known as Generation Y. The model of career anchors by Schein (1996) was used as a theoretical basis for analysis and comparison. The study is inductive and qualitative in nature, with data collected by applying the repertory grid. This technique is based on the psychology of the Personal Constructs of Kelly (1969) and is considered suitable for eliciting cognitive content without interference from the researcher. The results showed a set of eleven more frequent constructs, with the most significant being autonomy and flexibility in execution, social relevance, participation in management, responsibility for results and errors, and training requirement, mentioned by four respondents. The study allowed a new dimension valued by millennials in their careers to emerge in the field: connectivity, represented by the constructs for communication and responsibility for knowledge transmission. The elicitation of the connectivity dimension may be considered the theoretical contribution, strengthening the field of study and organizational practices in relation to the theme. The study also makes recommendations for future research.

T1  - Characterising the development of the understanding of human body systems in high-school biology students - a longitudinal study
AN  - 1954944572
AB  - Science education today has become increasingly focused on research into complex natural, social and technological systems. In this study, we examined the development of high-school biology students' systems understanding of the human body, in a three-year longitudinal study. The development of the students' system understanding was evaluated using the Components Mechanisms Phenomena (CMP) framework for conceptual representation. We coded and analysed the repertory grid personal constructs of 67 high-school biology students at 4 points throughout the study. Our data analysis builds on the assumption that systems understanding entails a perception of all the system categories, including structures within the system (its Components), specific processes and interactions at the macro and micro levels (Mechanisms), and the Phenomena that present the macro scale of processes and patterns within a system. Our findings suggest that as the learning process progressed, the systems understanding of our students became more advanced, moving forward within each of the major CMP categories. Moreover, there was an increase in the mechanism complexity presented by the students, manifested by more students describing mechanisms at the molecular level. Thus, the 'mechanism' category and the micro level are critical components that enable students to understand system-level phenomena such as homeostasis.

T1  - Young people’s conceptions of political information
AN  - 1950067442
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore young people’s conceptions of political information. The study sought to identify what political information sources young people encounter, how they construe these sources and the messages they communicate, and how the information experiences of young people may be better understood to inform information literacy interventions to support the development of political agency.Design/methodology/approachUsing personal construct theory as a conceptual framework, repertory grid (RG) interviews were used to explore the different ways in which 23 young people aged 14-15 from a town in Northern England conceive of political information and how they evaluate its quality and authority.FindingsThe study identified the sources of information young people engage with for finding and receiving what they understand as political information. The results from the RG interviews indicated that young people use a wide range of sources of political information to become informed about politics and the world around them. These sources of information include family, friends, teachers, television news, newspapers, radio shows, comedy shows, social media and community meetings. Participants were aware that they passively encounter information sources as well as actively engage in debate and discussion with other sources. Some participants had difficulty critically evaluating the political information sources they encounter. The nature of young people’s experiences of political information varied greatly. The degree of complexity in the experiences of political information varied not only between participants but was also dependent on their particular relationship with the information sources under scrutiny.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper has implications for personal construct analysis as a research approach broadly, from the point of view of its use within library and information science research. It is the first study to apply the personal construct approach to the study of young people’s political information use and to consider implications for information literacy support that would have been difficult to access using other approaches.Practical implicationsThe paper provides insight into an understudied area; that of young people’s conceptions of political information. This insight may be used to inform the improvement of political information provision and information literacy support for young people.Social implicationsA deeper understanding of the different ways in which young people identify, engage with and use information for political purposes may contribute to a clearer understanding of young people’s information needs, ideally leading to improved political education and a strengthened democratic process.Originality/valueThe paper explores a relatively under-researched area of library and information science research, and does so using a relatively under-used method in the domain. Insights into the perceived characteristics of different sources of political information are novel and contribute to the development of information behaviour and information literacy fields in terms of information for empowerment and democracy.

T1  - Understanding the dynamics of attitudes within a design and business focused collaboration
AN  - 1946611419
AB  - This paper aims to advance understanding about design’s unique contributions within collaborations between the disciplines of design and business. Collaboration between design and business functions is increasingly utilised as organisations seek to capitalise on a variety of knowledge and perspectives during the innovation process. Despite this increasing prevalence, the discipline of design can often be misunderstood by other disciplines within this particular interdisciplinary scenario due to the implicit knowledge that is central to the nature of design, which is often intangible and tacit in nature, yet provides designers with the capability to propose novel solutions to complex problem situations. This paper takes a deeper look at design attitude, which has previously been suggested to be one of the differentiators between design and other disciplines. The paper reflects on the results of a case study focusing on a collaboration between a multinational consumer goods company and a team of postgraduate students working out of a UK University. Data was obtained through observation, a reflective workshop and repertory grid based interviews. The originality of the paper lies in the way in which it categorises attitudes of different disciplines, in order to capture aspects of the design attitude that appear to be both unique and difficult for business focused people to adopt.

T1  - Communities of Practice as Systems: The Case of TEALEAF
AN  - 2210984718
AB  - This work provides an update to the Erasmus Plus TEALEAF project The outcomes of a week-long EU-funded / Irish Government-recognized teacher course in July 2016 is described within the context of a qualitative small scale study investigating teachers' progress in the course. The explicit aim of the teacher course was to equip a diverse group of teachers with the initial tools to work to produce simple digital apps for learning about biodiversity in their respective domains. A community of practice seeks to establish a new concept of the pre-existing generalised collective conscience through triangulated conversation between the generalised and particularised collective and individual consciences. In particular to revise the generalised collective conscience that teachers can program apps for learning about biodiversity. A number of features of teaching and learning were selected in general and their relationship to constructivism delineated. The teachers were prompted for their responses to each day of the course through a self evaluation tool and the responses were ranked according the the rubric. The data was analyzed using multidimensional scaling - ASCAL procedure - in SPSS 23TM and within the repertory grid domain according to the RepSocio tool in Rep 5TM. The plots show a gradual development throughout the week in terms of specific features becoming 'stronger' or exerting more influence towards the middle of the course and fragmenting after that. Analyses were able to show which participants correlated most closely with the hypothetical IDEAL within the community of practice. Concerning this community of practice, one determine the interrelationships within the community are determined using a social mapping exercise moving from the individual consciences to a particularised collective conscience.

T1  - Exploring Strategies for Successful Implementation of Electronic Health Records
AN  - 1961260206
AB  - Adoption of electronic health records (EHR) systems in nonfederal acute care hospitals has increased, with adoption rates across the United States reaching as high as 94%. Of the 330 plus acute care hospital EHR implementations in Texas, only 31% have completed attestation to Stage 2 of the meaningful use (MU) criteria. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore strategies that hospital chief information officers (CIOs) used for the successful implementation of EHR. The target population consists of 3 hospitals CIOs from a multi-county region in North Central Texas who successfully implemented EHRs meeting Stage 2 MU criteria. The conceptual framework, for this research, was the technology acceptance model theory. The data were collected through semistructured interviews, member checking, review of the literature on the topic, and publicly available documents on the respective hospital websites. Using methodological triangulation of the data, 4 themes emerged from data analysis: EHR implementation strategies, overcoming resistance to technology acceptance, strategic alignment, and patient wellbeing. Participants identified implementation teams and informatics teams as a primary strategy for obtaining user engagement, ownership, and establishing a culture of acceptance to the technological changes. The application of the findings may contribute to social change by identifying the strategies hospital CIOs used for successful implementation of EHRs. Successful EHR implementation might provide positive social change by improving the quality of patient care, patient safety, security of personal health information, lowering health care cost, and improvements in the overall health of the general population.

T1  - Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Psychosis: Measuring Psychological Change Using Repertory Grids
AN  - 1845642375
AB  - There are an increasing, but limited, number of studies investigating the benefits of mindfulness interventions for people experiencing psychosis. To our knowledge, changes following mindfulness for psychosis have not yet been explored from a personal construct perspective. This study had two main aims: (i) to explore changes in the way a person construes their self, others and their experience of psychosis following a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) group; and (ii) to replicate the findings of other studies exploring the feasibility and potential benefits of MBCT for psychosis. Sixteen participants, with experience of psychosis, completed an 8-week MBCT group. Participants completed pre-group and post-group assessments including a repertory grid, in addition to a range of outcome measures. There was some evidence of changes in construing following MBCT, with changes in the way participants viewed their ideal self and recovered self, and an indication of increased self-understanding. Improvements were found in participants' self-reported ability to act with awareness and in recovery. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of MBCT groups for people experiencing psychosis. Furthermore, it provides some evidence of changes in construal following MBCT that warrant further exploration. Large-scale controlled trials of MBCT for psychosis are needed, as well as studies investigating the mechanisms of change. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

              
Key Practitioner Message

              
MBCT may contribute to change in individuals' perceptions and increase self-understanding.

              
The study highlights the importance of measuring change in recovery following MBCT.

              
Findings support the need for person-centred approaches to assessment and monitoring of personal change following therapy.

              
Similar studies using a control group are needed in order to identify whether the changes found are attributable to participation in an MBCT group.

T1  - Let's stop the pretence of consistent marking: exploring the multiple limitations of assessment criteria
AN  - 1772196884
AB  - Unreliability in marking is well documented, yet we lack studies that have investigated assessors' detailed use of assessment criteria. This project used a form of Kelly's repertory grid method to examine the characteristics that 24 experienced UK assessors notice in distinguishing between students' performance in four contrasting subject disciplines: that is their implicit assessment criteria. Variation in the choice, ranking and scoring of criteria was evident. Inspection of the individual construct scores in a sub-sample of academic historians revealed five factors in the use of criteria that contribute to marking inconsistency. The results imply that, whilst more effective and social marking processes that encourage sharing of standards in institutions and disciplinary communities may help align standards, assessment decisions at this level are so complex, intuitive and tacit that variability is inevitable. We conclude that universities should be more honest with themselves and with students, and actively help students to understand that application of assessment criteria is a complex judgement and there is rarely an incontestable interpretation of their meaning.

T1  - A plea for adoption of ethical compliance
AN  - 2126567172
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to discuss the evolution of regulation and compliance in the past 20 years, to the current state of affairs. Despite earlier calls for ethical compliance within financial institutions, there remains scope for improvement within practice (as evidenced by on-going regulatory issues in the banking sector). Design/methodology/approach – Pre-crisis academic models of regulation and compliance are reviewed for evidence of use in practice. Some preliminary inductive research evidence is presented, following data collection via interviews with individuals impacted by compliance in financial service organisations. The interview data, facilitated by repertory grid, provide a post-crisis assessment of the issues faced by practitioners to comply with a new regulation. Findings – An over-reliance on group think and consulting services in compliance approach is potentially holding back progress in compliance service. Due to the limited recent empirical data offered in the literature, we believe further research into this area should be undertaken. Originality/value – This piece of research will provoke reflection on current practice vs existing academic theories, and seeks to identify whether alternative models are viable for the future of compliance approaches within practice.

T1  - Pharmacy Stores Profitability and Sustainability in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe
AN  - 1859071990
AB  - Zimbabwe’s catastrophic economic decline resulted in a high unemployment rate (95%), declining socioeconomic indicators, pharmacy stores’ unprofitability and lower sustainability. Profitable pharmacy stores play a fundamental role in ensuring public access to medication. Lack of pharmacy profitability leads to poor healthcare delivery, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. A healthy population is panacea to economic growth and prosperity and enhances human dignity, social cohesion, and the quality of life. In this qualitative, descriptive multicase study design, using Porter’s business strategies theory and the Deming process of quality assurance as conceptual frameworks, data from 11 pharmacy stores leaders in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe were collected during interviews with open-ended questions. Participants were assumed to have influence, knowledge, and a personal stake in the pharmacy sector and that their views and experiences could address the research question of lack of pharmacy profitability and sustainability. Data were explored, categorized, and tabulated to assist drawing empirical findings and conclusions that could answer the research question. Using software the data were analyzed and themes such as the centrality of strategy in running profitable pharmacies, customer care, reimbursements by medical insurance firms, the role of the legal and regulatory frameworks on pharmacies, and mergers of single-owner pharmacies emerged. Findings from the results might provide strategies for those in the pharmacy retail sector and individuals who intend to explore the sector. Individuals who read results of the study might be influenced to lobby government on behalf of the sector to relax prohibitive regulations.

T1  - Strategy and Profitability: Managing Profits in Inflation Economy
AN  - 1836064810
AB  - The inflation rate in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) rose to 5-year highs in 2014 and higher by 28% in the first half of 2015.  This situation has challenged business managers to sustain business goals.  Guided by Kaplan and Norton’s balanced scorecard framework. the purpose of this multiple case study was to explore strategies business managers use to maintain profitability with rising operating costs.  Two organizations in Dubai, United Arab Emirates were purposefully sampled for this multiple case study.  Data were collected through multiple semistructured interviews of a single senior manager from each organization, then triangulated with company e-mails and focus group interviews of 2 junior managers from each of the organizations. All data were analyzed using a 5-phased cycle of compiling, disassembling, reassembling, interpreting, and concluding to understand the emerging patterns.  The themes revealed cost reduction initiatives and revenue enhancements initiatives as the key strategies used by the business managers.  The approach and direction used in these strategies showed variance based on cost and revenue drivers of the organizations.  The findings of the study can be a guide for business managers to understand the essence of effective business strategies that counter challenging economic environments, thus sustaining profitability and developing additional employment opportunities for the surrounding community.

T1  - Strategies for Accessing Credit by Small and Medium Enterprises
AN  - 1812961069
AB  - Small and medium enterprise (SME) business owners play a significant role in the Kenyan economy as they account for approximately 78% of total employment and 57% of the new jobs created. The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore what strategies some Kenyan SME business owners used within the past 5 years to access credit to improve company profitability and growth. The target population consisted of 4 SME owners of businesses located in Kakamega Town, Kenya, who have had access to credit within the past 5 years. The conceptual framework for this study was the social capital theory. Semistructured interviews were conducted and company documents were gathered. All interpretations from the data were subjected to member checking to ensure the trustworthiness of findings. Based on the methodological triangulation of the data collected, 4 themes emerged after the data analysis: (a) group lending, (b) information access, (c) education and professional background of the entrepreneur, and (d) effect of access to credit on the performance of SMEs. The application of the findings from this study may contribute to social change by providing insights and strategies for SME business owners to access credit and ensure sustainable business growth that could potentially enhance community standards of living.

T1  - Exploring Bank Managers' Strategies for Developing Millennials for Leadership Roles in Commercial Banks
AN  - 1795533852
AB  - Understanding strategies to prepare Millennials for leadership roles in commercial banks is critical to ensure organizational stability and success and to avoid knowledge gaps and leadership deficiencies created by large numbers of retiring Baby Boomers. Guided by learning network theory and generational theory, the purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the strategies that 3 bank managers in North Carolina and South Carolina used to prepare Millennials for leadership. These 3 bank managers had a minimum of 2 years of experience leading teams of employees which included Millennials. The study included semistructured interviews to elicit detailed narratives from the bank managers on their experiences in preparing Millennials for leadership roles. Additional data included a review of public and private documents containing developmental activities and leadership program details used with Millennials. All data were analyzed and coded to identify recurring themes. Methodological triangulation was used to identify 5 key strategies used by managers to help prepare Millennials for leadership including structured development processes, generational alignment and engagement, coaching and mentoring, leveraging technology, and communications. Bank managers could use these findings to implement successful strategies to help Millennials prepare for leadership roles. Doing so promotes positive social change by identifying these strategies for bank managers to prepare key talent for leadership roles within organizations.

Building and maintaining the brand loyalty has been a key issue for the market research department from a long time. Various means have been utilized to promote the brand loyalty amongst the users. One of the recent means is the social media marketing. Social media marketing has totally changed the scenario of the traditional marketing tools by socially engaging with the customers. In this paper we take the case of a few Facebook pages of famous banks and perform a Repertory grid interview to obtain customer preferences of a positive user experience. The key-words thus generated were analyzed both subjectively and objectively to identify customer's search pattern for a good user experience using eye tracking usability tool identifying heat maps generated. Thus the paper gives an insight to the social media consultants to manage the content on Facebook branding page in a more holistic way.

T1  - Managing State Owned Enterprise: The Special Projects of Ghana
AN  - 1781217337
AB  - State-owned enterprise (SOE) failures continue to burden the government of Ghana. During the 5-year period ending in 2012, the profits from these equity investments dropped by 80%. This study was an exploratory case study of how top-down, board-directed governance structure impact the control and ethical structure of special projects. Sixteen participants, comprised of managers, technicians, and board members, were recruited from 4 separate special projects in northern, central, and southern Ghana. Agency theory formed the conceptual framework for this study. Data collected from the face-to-face interviews and supporting documents were processed and analyzed to discern emergent themes. Through methodological triangulation, 5 main themes emerged including board influence on management and operations, operational and financial controls, ethical values, quality assurance, and motivation. The implications for positive social change include helping to reduce poverty within the local communities of Ghana through the creation of competitive projects that can sustain a productive workforce.

T1  - Financing School-Based Health Centers: Sustaining Business Operational Services
AN  - 1733293118
AB  - School-based health centers (SBHCs) have faced challenges in securing adequate funding for operations and developing sound business systems for billing and reimbursement. Specifically, administrators often lack strategies to develop and sustain funding levels to support appropriate resources for business operations. The focus of this descriptive study was to explore best practice strategies to develop and sustain funding through the experiences of SBHC administrators. The conceptual framework included Elkington’s sustainability theory, which posits that corporate social responsibility, stakeholder involvement, and citizenship improve manager’s effect on the business system. Twenty full-time SBHC administrators working in separate locations throughout the state of Maryland participated in semistructured telephone interviews. The van Kaam process was used to cluster descriptive experiences in data analysis that resulted in the development of thematic strategies for implementing best practices relevant to developing and sustaining funding for SBHC business operations. Major themes provided by the participants were interagency communications, creating marketing plans, and disparities in the allocation of funding for programs and professional staff. Findings indicated SBHC administrators continue to face challenges in developing and sustaining adequate funding for operations in the state of Maryland. Suggestions for future research include how administrators can develop marketing plans and explore long-range funding for SBHC services. The findings in this study may contribute to positive social change by demonstrating to officials in the Maryland State Department of Education the significance of SBHCs, and the need to increase mental health services.

T1  - Examining the Predictive Validity of Emotional-Social Intelligence on Project Success in Software Development Teams
AN  - 1730212671
AB  - The problem addressed in this study was the high failure rate in technology projects due to interpersonal issues among team members.  According to the Standish Group CHAOS Report, over half of all technology projects fail due to the break down in interpersonal relationships in software development teams.  These failures may threaten business survivability.  An emerging view among project managers is that although tools and specific processes are important, interpersonal team dynamics and emotional-social intelligence (ESI) may make a difference in successful project outcomes.  In this quantitative, correlational study, emotional-social intelligent (ESI) competencies communication, motivation, and conflict resolution were investigated as predictors of project success.  Participants from 53 agile and 51 traditional software development teams from Hewlett-Packard (N=104), completed online questionnaires to measure ESI competencies and project success.  ESI levels were measured using the Team Emotional and Social Intelligence 2.0 (TESI) survey, and project success was measured with the Project Implementation Profile (PIP) assessment.  The relationship between communication, motivation, and conflict resolution and project success in agile project teams was not statistically significant ( p >.05).  The relationship between communication, motivation, conflict resolution and project success in traditional project teams was not statistically significant (p >.05).  The findings of this study indicate further research using an experimental design with the TESI using a pre and post intervention testing after coaching to develop ESI core competencies, to include, emotional awareness, stress tolerance, and team identity.  Further evaluation of social environment factors to determine project success is also recommended.

T1  - Examination of the relative importance of website elements for users of manufacturers representative websites
AN  - 1728900670
AB  - The purpose of this quantitative non-experimental study was to extend and enhance the growing body of research related to electronic commerce by examining the relative importance of content, ease-of-use, promotion, made-for-the-medium, and emotion elements of manufacturer’s representatives’ websites from the perspectives of site users, and to determine if the relative importance of these website elements varies as a function of occupational category. As these things are currently unknown, manufacturer’s representatives do not currently understand how to apply these critical elements to create a successful web presence. In this study, participants consisted of 90 graduates from four year accredited programs having earned a degree related to the art or science of illumination with a minimum of 5 years involvement in the lighting industry. The mean for content (M = 38.34, SD = 13.45) and ease-of-use (M = 34.17, SD = 12.96) indicated they were the most important website elements. Substantially lower means were found for emotion (M = 7.23, SD = 6.30) and promotion (M = 7.40, SD = 6.55) as well as made for the medium (M = 12.86, SD = 8.48) indicating these website elements to be less important. The mean ratings for the five website elements as a function of occupational group indicate little variation between the occupational groups in terms of the relative importance of the five website elements. Content and Ease-of-use were rated as more important than Promotion, Made for the Medium, and Emotion for all five occupational groups. The findings of this research suggest future research is needed taking industry specific contexts into account. In order to accomplish this, future research could be performed on a larger scale, with multiple industries. As the Internet continues to evolve, more research will be needed to evaluate how new technologies will affect the design of websites, and the effect on website element importance. Future research could also examine the relationship of industry, income, age, gender, or other demographics to website element preference. Research relating to the application of existing theory in an electronic commerce context is also an area for future research.

T1  - Power planning in ICT infrastructure: A multi-criteria operational performance evaluation approach
AN  - 1558315691
AB  - It is critical for information and communications technology (ICT) companies to carry our effective power planning, in order to support the growing number of services they provide, and this traditionally relies on the tacit knowledge and experience of senior staff. The loss of such domain knowledge resulting from the retirement of staff is an important issue for organizations such as Chunghwa Telecom (CHT), the largest ICT operator in Taiwan. This study thus develops a systematic power planning model using a multi-criteria operational performance evaluation. A group version of the fuzzy repertory grid and fuzzy TOPSIS approaches is applied to elicit a set of evaluation criteria that senior staff agree on, and then the priorities of the telecom rooms are evaluated against this. In addition, a new factor, reflecting the attitudes of the decision makers with respect to the degree of strictness, is defined to determine the superiority and inferiority of each alternative compared to the others. Furthermore, a novel decision aggregation strategy regarding the degree of variation among decision makers is proposed, and a quantitative assessment is carried out to analyze its impact on the ranking results in an objective manner. The proposed model may help ICT organizations to more effectively manage their power resources, and thus obtain competitive advantages.

T1  - Understanding the Twists and Turns of Academic Deanship: A Phenomenology of Filipino Medical Technology Deans' Struggles as Organizational Managers
AN  - 1655718293
AB  - Capitalizing on the power of qualitative approach in drawing out the multiple layers of meaning entrenched in subjective realities, this phenomenological inquiry described the lived experiences of 12 Filipino medical technology deans, as they face their struggles in managing their organization. An in-depth, semi-structured one-on-one interview which lasted for 1-2 h was conducted. Field texts were transcribed and analyzed using a repertory grid and through constant comparative analyses, an interesting model and a set of conceptual themes about deanship struggles were emerged. The 3-D model of deanship struggles, which is a product of the sharing of the respondents, provides a panorama of how Filipino medical technology deans balance (i) superiority and relationality; (ii) rule and role; (iii) obligation and allocation; (iv) personal and professional life; and (v) scholarship and leadership in an educational milieu of (i) prudence; (ii) transparency; (iii) justice; (iv) productivity; and (v) excellence using the gifts of (i) understanding; (ii) flexibility; (iii) bargaining; (iv) hard work; and (v) risk taking. Findings in this paper provide a valuable lens through which the Filipino medical technology deans' mindset as organizational managers could be viewed and understood

T1  - Terrorists' personal constructs and their roles: A comparison of the three Islamic terrorists
AN  - 1492596278
AB  - It is hypothesized that individuals who play different roles in terrorist organizations will have different psychological processes underlying their activities. An innovative examination of the personal construct systems of terrorists explored this. As part of a larger study, three individuals convicted of Islamic-related terrorist violence in India were interviewed using a semi-structured life narrative procedure enhanced by a Repertory Grid (Kelly, 1955/1991). One was a senior leader of a terrorist group, one a subordinate, the third a person who planted a bomb without full knowledge of the larger design he was part of. Principal component analyses of these grids informed by comments from the life narratives were used to elaborate each man's conceptual system and how it related to his commitment to violence. Important differences among the three individuals' in their construct systems were found. This demonstrated that the forms of Jihadi commitment is embedded in the individual's personal construct system. So, although these three case studies can only be taken as providing indicative results, they do point to aspects of construct systems that reveal the potential for disengagement, being most likely present in the lower echelons of terrorist organizations. Those who are unable to reconstrue themselves as having a non-terrorist future are unlikely to disengage. This is probably typical of those who lead these organizations. The results therefore contribute to the growing literature arguing for significant differences in terrorists' understanding of themselves and their roles and provide an original methodology for assessing a person's potential for deradicalization.

T1  - Meer of minder mondiaal burgerschap? Wanneer meten leren wordt. Een actieonderzoek rond het gebruik van kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethoden voor monitoring en evaluatie
AN  - 1951279396
AB  - Dit rapport beschrijft de resultaten van een actieonderzoek waarin vier Nederlandse organisaties die werken rond mondiaal burgerschap hebben geëxperimenteerd met kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethoden in hun monitoring en evaluatiecycli, om zo meer inzicht te verkrijgen in de effecten van hun interventies. De uitgeteste methoden omvatten onder andere de Most Significant Change methode, Kelly’s repertory grid analyse, focusgroep gesprekken en participatieve observatie. Het actieonderzoek heeft plaatsgevonden van begin 2013 tot halverwege 2014 en werd geïnitieerd door NCDO. De resultaten tonen aan dat het gebruik van deze methoden in de vier cases heeft bijgedragen tot diepere inzichten over de verwachte en onverwachte effecten van de interventies. Bovendien werkten zij een meer regelmatige effectmonitoring in de hand wat tijdige bijsturing van de interventie bevorderde. Ook lieten de kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethoden het toe om op een meer gestructureerde manier de stem van de doelgroepen en de projectmedewerkers te laten horen over de effecten van de interventie. Dit werd zowel door de doelgroepen en projectmedewerkers als sterk motiverend ervaren en leidde tot diepere inzichten over de effecten en de veranderingstheorie van de projecten. Het actieonderzoek toont echter ook aan dat het gebruik van kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethoden de nodige inspanning vergt van een project team dat niet altijd beschikt over de nodige ervaring met het verzamelen en analyseren van grote hoeveelheden kwalitatieve monitoring data.

T1  - Implicative Dilemmas and Symptom Severity in Depression: A Preliminary and Content Analysis Study
AN  - 1468398428
AB  - An implicative dilemma, a type of cognitive conflict, is found in a subject's repertory grid whenever a personal construct on which change is desired is associated with another construct on which change is undesirable. We studied dilemmas in 57 participants who met criteria for depressive spectrum disorders and compared them to 496 nonclinical controls. Almost 60% of the clinical sample presented with at least one implicative dilemma in their grids, as compared to 39% of controls. Participants with dilemma(s) showed higher levels of depressive symptoms and general distress (SCL-90-R) than those without any implicative dilemma in their grids. Also, the number of implicative dilemmas was associated with symptom severity. An analysis of the specific content of the personal constructs forming such dilemmas revealed that congruent constructs were mostly of moral nature, whereas discrepant constructs were related to emotional balance. Further studies may investigate whether an intervention targeted to the resolution of such dilemmas could be incorporated into existing treatments for depression to enhance their efficacy.

T1  - Outcomes associated with the use of microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees among individuals with unilateral transfemoral limb loss: A systematic review
AN  - 1372489054; 23881757
AB  - Microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees (MPKs) have been developed as an alternative to non-microprocessor-controlled knees (NMPKs) to address challenges facing individuals with lower-limb loss. A body of scientific literature comparing MPKs and NMPKs exists but has yet to be critically appraised. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review toexamine outcomes associated with the use of these interventions among individuals with transfemoral limb loss. A search of biomedical databases identified 241 publications, of which 27 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed for methodological quality and content. We developed 28 empirical evidence statements (EESs) in 9 outcome categories (metabolic energy expenditure, activity, cognitive demand, gait mechanics, environmental obstacle negotiation, safety, preference and satisfaction, economics, and health and quality of life) based on findings in the literature. The level of evidence supporting these EESs varied due to quantity, quality, and consistency of the results. EESs supported by a moderate level of evidence that noted significant differences between MPKs and NMPKs were derived in five of the nine outcome categories. The results from this review suggest that evidence exists to inform clinical practice and that additional research is needed to confirm existing evidence and better understand outcomes associated with the use of NMPKs and MPKs.

T1  - Development of the Chae Optimal Supervision Environment Test
AN  - 1445253196
AB  - The review of current supervision models and instruments revealed a crucial need for a valid, reliable instrument that assesses the quality of the supervision environment as a venue for promoting counselor development. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was the construction and initial validation of the Chae Optimal Supervision Environment Test (COSET). The five phases of scale development provided preliminary evidence of reliability and validity for the COSET. The COSET was administered to 93 counselor educators and clinical supervisors. Results indicated that the 15 item COSET possesses three factors: Emotional Environment, Learning Environment, and Power Environment. Reliability data also revealed that the COSET and its factors have adequate evidence of internal consistency. A three-factor COSET model demonstrated a good model fit using a confirmatory factor analysis. The results are largely supportive of the COSET as a scale to assess supervisors' creation of optimal supervision environments. Implications for the study and training of counselor supervisors were highlighted and suggestions for future research were reviewed.

T1  - Moving Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Multicultural Counseling Competence: The Role of Diversity Cognitive Complexity
AN  - 1355765668
AB  - This study explored several training variables that may contribute to counseling trainees' multicultural counseling self-efficacy and multicultural case conceptualization ability.  Specifically, this study aimed to examine the cognitive processes that contribute to multicultural counseling competence (MCC) outcome variables.  Clinical experience, multicultural knowledge, and multicultural awareness are assumed to provide the foundation for the development of these outcome variables.  The role of how a counselor trainee utilizes this knowledge and awareness in working with diverse populations has not been explored.  Diversity cognitive complexity (DCC) quantifies the process by which a counselor thinks about different elements of diversity in a multidimensional manner.  The current study examined the role of DCC on the relationship between training variables of direct clinical experience with diverse populations, multicultural knowledge, and multicultural awareness and the two training outcomes (multicultural counseling self-efficacy and multicultural case conceptualization ability).       A total of one hundred and sixty-one graduate trainees participated in the study. A series of hypotheses were tested to examine the impact of DCC on the relationship between MCC predictors (multicultural knowledge, multicultural awareness, and direct contact hours with diverse clinical populations) and two MCC outcomes:  multicultural counseling self-efficacy and multicultural case conceptualization ability.   Hierarchical regression analyses were utilized to test whether DCC mediated or moderated the relationship between the predictors and the outcome variables.  Multicultural knowledge and clinical hours with diverse populations were significant predictors of multicultural counseling self-efficacy.  Multicultural awareness was a significant predictor of multicultural case conceptualization ability.  Diversity cognitive complexity was not a significantly related to any predictor or outcome variable, thus all hypotheses tested were rejected.       The results of the current study support graduate programs emphasizing counselor trainees gaining multicultural knowledge and awareness as well as direct clinical experience with diverse clinical populations in an effort to foster MCC.  Although diversity cognitive complexity was not significantly related to the predictor or outcome variables in this study, further research is warranted to determine the validity of the measure used to assess DCC.  The findings in this study support the need for further research exploring training variables that contribute to multicultural counseling outcomes.

T1  - A Study on the Landscape Images of Hokkaido Constructed through Tourist Gazes
AN  - 1504526607
AB  - Landscape is one of the most important resources for tourism in Hokkaido. However, it is not yet clear what kinds of symbols constructing landscape representation are connected with the social construction of Hokkaido. In this study, the combination of a landscape image sketch and a questionnaire of repertory grid method revealed the social construction of Hokkaido through tourist gazes connected with landscape imagery of Hokkaido. The survey among Hokkaido residents, Japanese visitors and Taiwanese visitors was conducted in New Chitose Airport in summer and winter seasons. As a result, the landscape images of rural landscapes were appeared representing 'vast nature' common in the Hokkaido residents and Japanese visitors. It implies that the social construction of Hokkaido is affected by tourist gazes through mass media and further penetrates into the residents' local identity. On the other hand, Taiwanese visitors tended to represent impressive scenes and what they experienced through their sightseeing in Hokkaido. Hokkaido tourisms need to connect the social construction with cultural landscapes including production process and seasonal changes for regional development.

T1  - Understanding communities' views of nature in rural industry renewal: the transition from forestry to nature-based tourism in Eden, Australia
AN  - 925764542
AB  - This scoping paper examines the complex issue of assessing and understanding community views about the restructuring towards nature-based rural tourism of traditional agriculture and forestry rural economies and their activities that had hitherto shaped local identities. It shows how individual resident perceptions can be included within social impact assessment through the use of psychological methods and discusses the relative merits of using personal construct theory -based repertory grids. Ten repertory grid interviews were completed in Eden, New South Wales, Australia. The findings present both the resulting repertory grids and a more detailed discussion of the interpretation of the grids through two narratives that focus on residents considering what, in their opinion, constitutes a sustainable utilisation of local forest land. The discussion examines how the results of this type of analysis can be used to understand individual residents' decisions to support or reject nature-based tourism proposals in favour of traditional extractive forest-industry sectors. It shows how this assessment system could aid planners in reconciling stakeholder conflict over the ideal usage of public forest land by offering a structured means of giving heterogeneous rural communities a formal voice in tourism-planning processes.

AB  - Researchers have shown that transformational leadership is a valid leadership theory through research of for-profit organizations; however, it lacks empirical support among nonprofit organizations (Riggio, Bass, & Orr, 2003).  The intent of this study was to determine whether nonprofit employees are more highly engaged and committed in organizations in which transformational leadership is practiced, building upon original research on transformational leadership theory conducted by the seminal works of Downton (1973), House (1977), and Burns (1978).   Correlational analysis investigated the relationships between transformational leadership, employee engagement, and organizational commitment, using a survey of 389 nonprofit employees who completed the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5X-Short) which measures transformational leadership (Bass & Avolio, 1990), the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) which measures engagement by Schaufeli, Bakker, and Salanova (2006), and the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ) developed by Meyer, Allen, and Smith (1993), which measures organizational commitment.  Results suggested a significant positive relationship between higher levels of transformational leadership and higher levels of employee engagement in all three engagement subscales (vigor, dedication, and absorption), and higher levels of organizational commitment in the normative commitment subscale.  However, there was a significant negative relationship between higher levels of transformational leadership and higher levels of organizational commitment in the other two commitment subscales (affective commitment and continuance commitment).  The results support the initial hypothesis that higher levels of transformational leadership lead to higher levels of engagement but do not support the hypothesis that higher levels of transformational leadership lead to higher levels of organizational commitment.

T1  - Multi-level Examination of Idiosyncratic Deals: Antecedents and Consequences
AN  - 904574751
AB  - Idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) are individually negotiated deals between employees and the organization. This study investigates relative leader-member exchange (RLMX), leader-focused procedural (LPJ) and interactional justice (LIJ) as antecedents to i-deals. In addition, boundary conditions for these relationships are explored. At the group level LMX group-median (GLMX), LIJ and LPJ climates are examined as antecedents to i-deals group-median. This study also explores outcomes of i-deals. Drawing on social exchange and social comparison perspectives I argue that i-deals are positively related to employees' career satisfaction, organizational identification, and organizational citizenship behaviors, and these positive relationships between i-deals and outcomes are stronger in work-groups with higher variability or lower average level of i-deals. Finally, a positive relationship is proposed between group-median i-deals and team potency. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 208 manager-subordinate dyads nested in 54 work-groups. Results show positive relationships between LPJ, LIJ and i-deals, and between GLMX, LIJC, LPJC, and group-median i-deals. Regarding the outcomes of i-deals, results reveal positive relationships between i-deals and career satisfaction and organizational identification, and between group-median i-deals and team potency.

T1  - An Exploration of the Identification of Implicative Dilemmas and Their Relationship to Personal Construct Theory-Congruent Measures of Psychological Well-Being in Nonclinical Samples
AN  - 1030252148
AB  - Studies using George Kelly's repertory grid method have indicated a possible relationship between psychological well-being and a variety of measures of conflict and inconsistencies. This study examined the relationship between implicative dilemmas, defined as cognitive conflicts in which implicit associations between desired and undesired states prevent persons from actualizing their ideal selves, and measures of psychological distress assessing psychological states consistent with personal construct theory (PCT), including novel single-item measures of anxiety, guilt, self-esteem, and constriction versus dilation. The use of measures designed to assess various potentially distressing psychological states as described by Kelly rather than traditional measures of psychological distress states was advocated as a means of assessing these phenomena in a way that more accurately reflects both PCT and human experience. The study also differentiated between implicative dilemmas in which a desired change along a self-construct was perceived as possible (resolvable implicative dilemmas) and those in which desired changed was perceived as impossible (unresolvable implicative dilemmas). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that implicative dilemmas accounted for significant unique variance in Anxiety and Guilt scores on the single-item measures as well as grid-based self-esteem scores only when unresolvable dilemmas were removed, suggesting that the perceived resolvability of self-discrepancies involved in implicative dilemmas may be key to assessing the relationship between implicative dilemmas and psychological distress. Namely, it is suggested that the cost of change assumed in the concept of implicative dilemmas may also be seen as a consolation when desired change is viewed as impossible.

T1  - A framework of students' reasons for using CMC media in learning contexts: A structural approach
AN  - 900528461
AB  - Motivated by the increasing popularity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) media in university students' learning, this study employs a four-stage novel approach for analyzing and developing a structured hierarchy framework for students' usage of CMC media in learning contexts. First, media characteristics and the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach were adopted to understand student-specific reasons for using media. Second, a set of relevant data concerning the university students' reasons for using CMC media was collected by the Repertory Grid Interview Technique (RGT) and analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. The Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique was then used to develop a six-level hierarchical structural model of media use reasons. Finally, the cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) technique was used to analyze the driver and dependence power for each media use reason and identify the hidden and indirect relationships among all reasons. The reasons related to students' use of CMC were classified as independent variables, linkage variables, and dependent variables. The study provides a validated typology of different clusters of interrelated students' reasons for using CMC media in learning contexts. The findings of this study will have significant implications and will be helpful for researchers, university policy-makers, instructors, and organizations in framing CMC technology implementation and use strategies.

T1  - Personal Usability Constructs: How People Construe Usability Across Nationalities and Stakeholder Groups
AN  - 879336219
AB  - Whereas the concept of usability is predominantly defined analytically, people relate to systems through personal usability constructs. Based on 48 repertory-grid interviews, this study investigates how such personal constructs are affected by two factors crucial to the international development and uptake of systems: nationality (Chinese, Danish, or Indian) and stakeholder group (developer or user). We find no significant overall difference across nationalities, but further analyses suggest that conventional usability aspects such as ease of use and simplicity are prominent for Chinese and Danish but not Indian participants and that a distinction between work and leisure-related communication is central to Chinese and Indian but not Danish participants. For stakeholder groups, we find a significant overall difference between developers and users. Unlike developers, users associate ease of use with leisure and, conversely, difficulty in use with work-relatedness. Further, users perceive usefulness as related to frustration and separate from ease of use, whereas developers construe usefulness, fun, and ease of use as related. In construing usability, participants make use of several constructs that are not part of prevailing usability definitions, including usefulness, fun, and security. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cognitive Conflict and Consensus Generation in Virtual Teams During Knowledge Capture: Comparative Effectiveness of Techniques: JMIS JMIS
AN  - 1366388131
AB  - Effective knowledge management has been increasingly cited as critical for businesses to compete successfully. Knowledge acquisition/capture, the first step in knowledge management, continues to be a bottleneck and is exacerbated when experts are geographically distributed. Furthermore, knowledge from multiple experts is likely to generate inconsistent knowledge for a given problem domain. There is thus a compelling need to generate consensus by resolving inconsistencies and conflicts that may occur among experts during the process of knowledge acquisition. This process is more challenging when dealing with virtual teams of experts. This study addresses task-based or cognitive conflicts among experts. A key objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two cognitive techniques -- the repertory grid (or RepGrid) and Delphi -- in generating consensus among experts during the knowledge capture process. A field experiment with geographically distributed real-world network experts involving multiple rounds of interaction over an extended period of time was conducted. Findings from this research indicate that, in the short run, Delphi works better than the RepGrid in reducing conflict and generating consensus. However, the RepGrid technique appears to perform better in the long run. We find similar results for satisfaction with the process and outcome. Our findings also indicate that experts using the RepGrid technique elicited more knowledge as well as higher-quality knowledge than experts using the Delphi technique. To sum up, our study indicates that RepGrid is superior to Delphi, and therefore managers should seriously consider the use of RepGrid in capturing knowledge from multiple and distributed experts when dealing with complex real-world issues.

T1  - An investigation of attitudes of students and teachers about participating in a context-aware ubiquitous learning activity
AN  - 860228889
AB  - In recent years, digital learning has been converting from e-learning to m-learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with mobile devices. Consequently, context-aware ubiquitous learning (u-learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless, mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in the learning process. In this paper, a context-aware u-learning environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition, we probe the feasibility of context-aware u-learning in courses by soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable of enhancing students' motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover, it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better control of class order.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Filipino Arts Among Elders in Institutionalized Care Settings
AN  - 880188920
AB  - The use of traditional art in recreational therapies is unexplored. This paper, thus, attempts to surface the unique power of traditional Filipino arts (TFA) as synergizing lens in capturing the individual and the collective experiences of a select group of Filipino elderly in an institutionalized care setting relative to their feelings of depression and self-esteem. Three Filipino elderly housed in an institutionalized care setting were chosen for this phenomenological study, a robotfoto and a series of semistructured interviews constitute the main data gathering tool. Field texts were subjected to phenomenological reduction via the repertory grid analysis. Emerged themes were subjected to a series of member checking procedures to ensure the trustworthiness of the reported data. Depression and self-esteem were interpreted via two emerged themes. The themes were Me, Myself, and Melancholy and Will Not Let My Worth Wither. Through recreational therapies in the form of traditional Filipino arts, participants found novel psychological crutches that overcame the challenges of depression and give them hope toward more positive views of themselves and life.

T1  - Young students' attitudes toward languages
AN  - 874975233
AB  - In this research study, the attitudes of English- and Spanish-speaking students from three Midwest states in the U.S., who were enrolled in second, and world language education programs in the early grades of elementary school (K-2) were evaluated and compared with the attitudes of students at the same grade levels enrolled in English-only programs in which no world languages were taught. One of the groups of young students was participating in a Spanish two-way immersion program and their attitudes were compared with the attitudes of students from the same school district in a similar comparative school with an English-only program. The other group of students was participating in a Chinese world language program. Their attitudes were compared with students at the same grade levels (K-2) in similar schools within the same school districts. In these comparative schools, however, there were no world language programs. In general, students enrolled in Spanish two-way immersion programs or in the Chinese world language program demonstrate more positive attitudes toward languages than students enrolled in English-only programs.

T1  - Classifying health‐related behaviours: Exploring similarities and differences amongst behaviours
AN  - 2124787337
AB  - Objectives.  The classification of health behaviours may provide a useful framework for understanding their characteristics and therefore the ways in which they are similar and different. However, to date, little research has attempted to identify these characteristics and explore the dimensions along which behaviours differ. This paper uses an inductive approach to explore this issue.Design and methods.  In Study 1, 25 repertory grid interviews and 3 focus groups encompassing lay public and health professionals identified 25 ways of describing health behaviours. These were refined into 11 key characteristics. In Study 2, 180 members of the general public rated 20 health behaviours on each of these characteristics.Results.  Principal components analysis indicated behaviours were perceived along three key dimensions: ‘easy immediate pay‐offs’ versus ‘effortful long‐term pay‐offs’; ‘private unproblematic’ versus ‘public and problematic’; and ‘important routines’ versus ‘unimportant one‐offs’. Risk behaviours were clearly differentiated being perceived as ‘easy immediate pay‐offs’ and ‘public–problematic’. In contrast with other approach behaviours such as diet or self‐examination, physical activity behaviours were perceived as ‘effortful long‐term pay‐offs’.Conclusions.  This research provides an useful starting point in the development of a framework that allows us to better understand differences and similarities between health behaviours. These dimensions may be important to consider when researchers set out to predict or change behaviour.

T1  - Information Overload or Information Under Siege: Filipino Faculty Extendees' Concept, Motivation and Expectations
AN  - 880188957
AB  - Previous studies have quantified the extent of usage, knowledge, and relationship of people's behavior in regard to food supplements -- particularly in developed countries such as the United States. Despite the prevalence of supplements use and the issues surrounding its use, there has been little or no study of supplement use in a developing country like the Philippines. This study aimed to explore, qualitatively, the concept, motivations, and expectations of a select group of Filipino elderly relative to their use of commercialized food supplements (CFS). Five faculty extendees from a private university in the Philippines were selected in this phenomenological study. A two-part research instrument consisting of a robotfoto and a face-to-face interview guide with semistructured questions was used. Extended texts were subjected to phenomenological reduction via repertory grid analysis. Conceptual clusters that emerged were subjected to the member checking procedure for purposes of ensuring data trustworthiness. Through constant comparison of the concepts, expectations, and motivations of the respondents of the study relative to their use of CFSs, a clear-cut taxonomy of users was identified: (a) the idealist-experimentalist and (b) the realist-pragmatist. The emerged typologies in this study create a picture that can help healthcare providers understand the dynamics of patient behavior toward CFS use. Implications of the study to health education are also documented in this paper. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A phenomenological study on the potential impact of implementing information systems in midsize corporations
AN  - 856601315
AB  - In spite of enormous investment and remarkable advancement in information system technology (IST) corporations, human integration remains the dominant factor in their success. While 10% of the failure can be attributed to technique failures, 90% are due to human issues. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to capture the lived experiences of 25 employees in their different midsize corporations in southern California. Moustakas’ modified van Kaam methodology assisted in the analysis of data collection in the study. The data and analysis indicated the following themes necessitating organizational success during IS rapid change and implementation: (a) healthy working environment,(b) effective communication, (c) alleviate resistance to change, (d) assimilation, (e) minimizing stress, (f) knowledge sharing, (g) effective leadership, (h) empowerment, (i) risks taking, and (j) means of communications and collaborations. Several of the emergent themes corresponded with research on leadership, organizational and system theories perceived such as (a) strategic planning, (b) training and honing skills, and (c) motivating innovation.

T1  - Teacher perceptions of high school students underachievement in science
AN  - 741546953
AB  - Low high school graduation rates continue to be a challenge in American public education. The pressure to meet the demands of adequate yearly progress (AYP) under the No Child Left behind Act of 2001 has led to an achievement gap in student performance between science and other core subjects, namely English, math, and social studies, on the Georgia High School Graduation Test (GHSGT). GHSGT statistics have consistently reflected a lower science pass percentage compared with other core subjects on the test. The objective of this nonexperimental, quantitative study was to analyze teacher perceptions on reasons for student science underachievement on the GHSGT. A self-developed questionnaire based on Bloom’s taxonomy model was administered to 115 high school core subject teachers of a single school district. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used to test hypotheses. Results confirmed that teachers perceived that (a) students demonstrated a low rate of proficiency in science because science demands higher cognitive skills, (b) less emphasis was placed on science because it is a non-AYP indicator, and (c) making science an AYP indicator will optimize student science achievement. Based on results, recommendations were made to promote the integration of English, math, and social studies curriculum with science curriculum to enable students to transfer learned skills and information across subjects. The potential benefits of outcome of this study include (a) providing critical insight for policy makers and educational practitioners to understand the impact of science underachievement on graduation rates, and (b) raising student science achievement to improve graduation rates.

T1  - Development of a method to investigate medical students’ perceptions of their personal and professional development
AN  - 2259157942
AB  - Personal and Professional Development (PPD) is now key to the undergraduate medical curriculum and requires provision of appropriate learning experiences. In order to achieve this, it is essential that we ascertain students’ perceptions of what is important in their PPD. We required a methodological approach suitable for a large medical school, which defines constructs used by the students to describe their PPD, and is not constrained by a researcher’s predetermined line of questioning. It should also quantify the saliencies of these constructs in the student population and indicate how they gauge their own PPD. The instrument should also be suitable for administration at key stages of the students’ learning experience. Here we describe the first stages in developing a novel method, which fulfils these requirements. It is based on a modified self repertory grid, the “Ideal Self” Inventory. All first year students (N = 379), provided five descriptors of a “good medical student” and of a not very good medical student, which generated 1,531 ‘ideal’ qualities. To define underlying themed constructs, 49 randomly selected descriptors, were grouped together by self selected students (n = 55), using commonly held assumptions. Frequency of item co-occurrence was tabulated by multidimensional scaling. Themed clusters of ‘ideal’ qualities, defined by hierarchical cluster analysis, were overlaid onto the multidimensional scaling to generate a concept map. This revealed seven themed constructs; Personal Welfare, Time and Self Management Committed Work Ethic, Learning Skills, Personal Development/Reflection, Personal and Professional Conduct and Teamwork. We then analysed the 1,531 ‘ideal’ qualities, by determining the frequency with which students used each construct and the proportion of students who used a construct at least once. Personal and Professional Conduct, Committed Work Ethic and Time and Self Management were the most frequently used, implying that they were the most salient for the first year students.

T1  - Cognitive segmentation: Modeling the structure and content of customers' thoughts
AN  - 227752011
AB  - This paper proposes a cognitive segmentation technique that models both customers' cognitive content and structure. Cognitive segmentation provides a quantitative operationalization of idiographic cognitions that can be compared and integrated across customers to move beyond the in-depth understanding and wide generalizing trade-off. In addition, cognitive segmentation utilizes participants' own semantics for eliciting and aggregating cognitions. This method allows researchers to understand content in light of structure, as participants' elicited cognitive contents are further interpreted as a function of the complexity of their cognitive structures. The conceptual foundations from personal construct theory as well as a description of the nine-step implementation process whereby participants fill out a modified version of Kelly's Repertory Grid and complete Borman's trait implication procedure are provided. An application illustrates how cognitive segmentation can identify and assess the size potential of each customer target as a function of their cognitive content and structure. A discussion of the results and directions for further research are also provided. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing the relationship between the Internet, radio frequency identifier (RFID), and information technology (IT) flexibility: A correlational study and findings
AN  - 305165279
AB  - The issue of strategically aligning IT with the business has been the subject of numerous studies and research efforts both in the IT and business fields. Recent studies and research efforts on the issue of aligning IT with the business strategically have provided empirical evidence that IT flexibility is the main factor, rather than strategic alignment, in any organizational efforts aimed at achieving a successful alignment between IT and the business. One of the dimensions of IT flexibility is modularity which encompasses the tools and technologies that IT provides that aid organizations in accomplishing their organizational goals. As such, the goal of this study was to focus on these two IT tools, the Internet and RFID, in an effort to discover whether or not they correlate positively or otherwise with IT flexibility. This study was also aimed at discovering which of these two tools has stronger correlation with IT flexibility. Statistical tests conducted on the data collected for this study were Pearson’s correlation coefficient, computational analysis using chi-square crosstabs (2 x 2). Based on these tests, the findings of this study present empirical evidence that support the hypotheses that a positive correlation exists between INTERNET and ITF (r = 0.437,  p < .001), RIFD and ITF (r = .401, p  < .001), with no significant correlations between INTERNET and RFID (r = .266, p = 0.790). These finding also show that the correlation between RFID and IT flexibility is stronger than that of the Internet and IT flexibility. Finally, the results of this study show that when combining both the Internet and RFID, the strength of the correlation between these two IT tools and IT flexibility becomes significantly higher correlation (r2 = .663, F(1,176) = 118.655, p

T1  - An investigation of the relationships between Emergency Medical Technician's ratings of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) director's transformational leadership and job satisfaction in rural EMS environments
AN  - 305151029
AB  - Leadership is important in any profession especially in challenging professions such as Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and paramedics are the backbone of the EMS profession. EMS leadership must influence diverse personnel providing life-saving support for patients in stressful work environments. For example, many EMS organizations are either all volunteer or a combination of volunteer and low-paid professionals. The work-hours are usually long, patient care is challenging, much of the work is performed in a traumatic environment, and EMTs are routinely unappreciated by patients and other members of the medical profession. The focus of the study was EMS leadership. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between Emergency Medical Technician's (EMTs), including paramedics, and their perceptions of director's transformational leadership style in six rural counties in South Central Texas. The study also examined job satisfaction. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) was used to measure transformational leadership. Job satisfaction was measured using the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and Job in General (JIG) combination questionnaire. Study findings indicate there is a relationship between EMS director's transformational leadership and organizational satisfaction, effectiveness, and extra effort as perceived by EMTs and paramedics.

T1  - Correlation of student expectations of online classes and course *grades at a community college
AN  - 305126584
AB  - Course grades are lower in community colleges compared to 4-year schools; however, little research is available regarding the factors relating to course grades in 2-year schools. Due to decreased course grades in online classes and the expected growth of distance education programs, community college leaders need to take action to help students achieve success in college. The purpose of the quantitative, correlational research study was to determine if a relationship exists between student expectations of online classes and course grades for a convenience sample of students enrolled in one or more online classes at a community college in central North Carolina. The student expectations of the level of difficulty, time commitment, and required technical and computer skills were correlated with student course grades. The participants included 123 students enrolled in one or more online classes at a community college. Data collection involved a researcher-developed survey and obtaining end-of-course grades. Results indicated that a statistically significant relationship existed between student expectations of the time commitment of online classes and course grades. The greater the student perceived the time commitment the more likely the student was to pass the course. A significant relationship did not exist between student expectations of the difficulty and required technical and computer skills of online classes and course retention. A significant relationship did exist between a set of predictor variables including student perceptions of the difficulty, time commitment, required technical and computer skills, and course grades.

T1  - A musically motivated approach to spatial audio for large venues
AN  - 304970961
AB  - Spatial audio refers to those aspects of sound reproduction associated with the perceived direction and expanse of sound images. The vast majority of research on spatial audio considers a single listener, ideally positioned in the listening area among the speakers. From that position, spatial effects can be quite convincing. However, this approach cannot be extended to large or public spaces, or to non-centered listeners. Many existing solutions are limited to cinematic special effects or have extensive hardware requirements.    This dissertation presents a new approach to large-venue spatialization, particularly appropriate for musical and creative artistic works. Digital signal processing (DSP) is used to explicitly control the region of focus in the listening area, and hence which audience members are receiving spatial cues. By moving the target area over time, the entire audience can receive maximally effective spatial audio at some point. Target location processing is guided by consideration of the entire soundfield. The emphasis is not on absolute localization accuracy but on potential aesthetic uses. The system is not limited to localization cues; decorrelation effects are treated with equal attention.    A spherical head model is used, both for synthetic directional cues and for predicting the physical acoustic response. Targeting of listener locations is performed using several methods, including crosstalk cancellation. This work also makes the novel assertion that overhead loudspeakers create an optimal soundfield, both by maximizing the target area and by minimizing undesirable properties elsewhere. Evidence is provided to quantify and support this claim.    A historical review of prior approaches to spatial audio in large venues is given first. The relevant literature on spatial hearing perception is then summarized, with emphasis on large-space loudspeaker reproduction. Next, the signal processing techniques used for implementation are discussed. Evaluation is done primarily through simulations of soundfields using recorded Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). In addition, listening demonstrations were conducted to confirm the correct operation of the system.

T1  - Effects of group status and cognitive appraisal prime on integrative complexity in a decision making context
AN  - 304918890
AB  - Integrative complexity has been shown to influence information-processing and decision-making in different social situations. The present research assessed the effects of group status and cognitive appraisal prime on complexity in a group decision-making context. Experiment 1 assessed group status effects, and Experiment 2 tested whether priming threat or challenge would moderate those effects. Both experiments found that minority members showed greater complexity than majority members. Experiment 2 found that appraisal prime moderated the relationship between status and complexity. Minority members receiving the threat prime were the most complex, while majority members in the threat and control conditions were the least complex. The mediating roles of cognitive appraisal, anxiety, and coping expectancy were assessed, but none were found to be significant mediators of complexity.

T1  - Older people and convenience in meal preparation: a European study on understanding their perception towards vegetable soup preparation
AN  - 210896321
AB  - A sample of 768 seniors over 65 years, living in eight European countries, was interviewed to investigate perceptions, preferences and attitudes towards convenience in preparation of vegetable soups. In each country, a range of seven vegetables soups varying in preparation levels required before consumption was identified. The first part of the interview (in-depth interview) was carried out by using the Repertory Grid Method, an effective method to describe perceptions of foods using consumers' own language. Overall, vegetable-related foods with convenience in preparation were perceived in similar ways across the countries. Older adults tended to describe ready vegetable soups mainly making associations related to preparation, rather than on their own preferences and evaluations. Conversely, fresh vegetables requiring all preparation or considerable preparation (cut fresh vegetables) were mainly associated with attributes such as taste, freshness, health benefits  and familiarity with the product . The second session of the interview was based in part on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. A component measuring the extent to which it is felt necessary to eat convenience foods (perceived need) was assessed as well. Generally speaking, older people did not seem to view positively the consumption of convenience foods. Additionally, they did not feel the need to consume these products nor do they have the intention to consume them in the forthcoming month. Pleasure associated with performance of the behaviour was the most important determinant of intention to eat convenience foods in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. Perceived need was the most important factor in determining the intention to eat convenience foods in the UK, Poland and Portugal. Perceived control and subjective norms were the most important factors influencing the intention to eat convenience foods in Italy. The encouragement of consuming ready-meals might represent an opportunity to have healthier food choices and to reduce the risk a monotonous diet for older people who cannot or do not know how to cook, combined with a low interest in food-related activities such as cooking.

T1  - Relationships among professional nursing autonomy, perceived organizational support, and clinical nursing expertise
AN  - 304610506
AB  - Research shows that there is a difference in the quality of nursing practice between expert and non-expert nurses. However, not all nurses develop expertise even after years of experience. Some nurses practice for many years, efficiently managing patient care, but not developing expertise.    It was hypothesized that factors other than years of experience was related to nursing expertise. The purpose of this study was to explore relationships between professional nursing autonomy, perceived organizational support, and clinical nursing expertise in acute care settings. The investigator invited a random sample of 1050 clinical bedside nurses from four hospitals (two Magnet and two non-Magnet hospitals) in eastern Iowa and western Illinois to participate in the study. Three hundred and seventy nurses chose to participate, representing a 45.5% response rate. Participants completed a demographic survey and three self-report surveys on Clinical Nursing Expertise, Professional Nursing Autonomy, and Perceived Organizational Support.    The results showed that there is a positive correlation between years of experience and nursing expertise in both Magnet and non-Magnet hospitals. There was no significant correlation between level of education and expertise in either Magnet or non-Magnet hospitals. There is a statistically and practically significant correlation between professional nursing autonomy and nursing expertise in clinical beside nurses in both Magnet and non-Magnet hospitals. There was no significant correlation between perceived organizational support and nursing expertise. There was a statistically significant, (though perhaps not practically significant) relationship between professional nursing autonomy and perceived organizational support.    The results of this study have implications for nursing administration and nursing education because improving conditions for nursing autonomy may have a positive effect on nursing expertise.

T1  - Ego development and theoretical orientation among counseling students
AN  - 304548056
AB  - This study investigated potential relationships between master’s level counseling students’ levels of ego development and their identified orientations to one of six guiding theories of counseling; students’ theoretical orientation classifications when classified according to the theory’s domain of emphasis: affective, behavioral, or cognitive; students’ degrees of confidence in identifying their theoretical orientations; and students’ degrees of comfort in applying their theories in clinical practice. Seventy participants enrolled in a master’s level practicum course completed the Washington University Sentence Completion Test, a measure of ego development, and the Counseling Theory Survey, a survey developed by the researcher, in order to identify students’ identified theoretical orientations, students’ degrees of confidence in identifying their theoretical orientations, and students’ degrees of comfort in applying their theories in clinical practice. Ego development level was operationalized as a dichotomous variable consisting of level E5 and below and E6 and above, based on the developmental task attained at E6: a shift from emphasis on in-group identity to self-evaluated standards. To determine potential relationships between the students’ ego development levels and their theoretical orientations and their orientations when classified by domain of emphasis, 2 x 4 and 2 x 3 Chi-square analyses were used. Independent t-tests were conducted to determine if the students’ degrees of confidence in identifying their theoretical orientation and their degrees of comfort in applying their orientation varied across the two groups. No statistically significant results were found. Alternative explanations for the identification of theoretical orientation, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are discussed with emphasis on the need for greater integration of current theories related to the identification of theoretical orientation.

T1  - The impact of computer mediated communication systems monitoring on organizational communications content
AN  - 304468386
AB  - Employer monitoring of communications is prevalent and on the rise due in part to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Health Insurance Privacy Protection Act, and other legislation in the U.S. and other countries. However, the critical effect of this new activity on what is communicated in companies has not been assessed. This dissertation examines the impacts of computer mediated communication systems monitoring on neutral, incriminating and exculpatory content, as well as the overall volume of communications issued on monitored and non-monitored computer mediated communication systems. Incriminating communication is cataloged in a hazard communications taxonomy for this investigation. A controlled laboratory experiment has subjects participate in an instant messaging discussion on a topic for which they are likely to be aware of information that is incriminating to their organization, or its members, or both. Consistent with self awareness theory, monitored subjects engage in significantly less overall and neutral communication. They volunteer fewer high intensity hazard communications, but are less likely to curtail low intensity hazard communications. They issue denials about more incriminating topics. Contributions to research include theory development, especially in the area of standard selection; application of self-awareness theory to the new domain of computer mediated communications monitoring; a research framework; a taxonomy and coding scheme for the new hazard communications constructs; and a relative standards influence instrument and methodology for use in studying competing standards. Implications for corporate monitoring and communications policies are discussed, and a research agenda is outlined.

T1  - Understanding the persona of clinical instructors: The use of students' doodles in nursing research
AN  - 200171553
AB  - While it is true that understanding the attributes and unique distinction of the nursing faculty has been the subject of most of the studies, little is known about how the use of doodles can help surface the persona of the clinical instructors. This study aims to capture the essence or the lebenswelt of the concept of "clinical instructor" from the lens of students' doodles which have been considered as a powerful qualitative tool in articulating individual experiences. A total of 195 senior nursing students recruited from a comprehensive university in the Philippines were the subjects in this qualitative study. Data were gathered from self-generated illustrations and written explanations made by the subjects to identify their concept of effective and ineffective clinical instructors. Phenomenological reduction was observed through a repertory grid, where doodles drawn were listed, categorized and thematised to reveal the qualities of the clinical instructor. The subjective nature of the findings, though not generalizable, has surfaced how doodling can be a potent tool in identifying collective interpretation of the essence of health professions construct such as the one under study. The doodles revealed that an effective clinical instructor (enlightening, engaging and embracing) is one who is able to facilitate the learning of the students as well as being able to establish a harmonious learning atmosphere for and with the students. On the other hand, an ineffective clinical instructor (detrimental, dangling, and disturbing) impedes students' development in the clinical practice by causing conflict through their personal attitudes and their teaching strategies. This can have benefits for clinical instructors, to improve themselves and realize the impact of their attributes to the clinical learning of students.

T1  - British army leadership: is it gendered?
AN  - 213155919
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of the female British Army officer, to determine whether female Army officers lead in different ways to male Army officers. The conceptual framework was transformational and transactional leadership theory. Data were gathered in semi structured interviews with 24 Army officers, split 50:50 between men and women using repertory grid, and critical incident methods. Women and men Army officers interviewed do lead in different ways with women demonstrating a gender management aspect to their leadership. The research also identified that women officers experience an "armoured glass" ceiling in terms of career progression, the research developed a conceptual model of military leadership that differs from the transformational/transactional leadership model. It also disconfirms contemporary leadership theory that conflates leadership and change management. The paper makes no claims for generalisability because of the unrepresentative sample. Further, research is needed on a representative sample basis. The paper may inform policy on the management and development of female Army officers. It may also have utility in improving leadership development in the British Army and other UK Armed Services. The paper makes a contribution in two areas; it adds to the growing body of research that indicates men and women lead in different ways and assessing the implications that flow from this.

T1  - The physical community college library: A single institution study of the relationship between user satisfaction and library use
AN  - 304840223
AB  - As an increasing number of library resources that support community colleges become available electronically and can be accessed without having to come to a physical location, the need for the continued maintenance of the physical space of the library has come into question. Community college administrators require data about use of the library as place to inform their decision making regarding the provision of fiscal resources towards the maintenance of the physical space of the library.    The purpose of this study was to explore user satisfaction as a possible motivation for use of the physical space of the community college library. The study utilized an online library user satisfaction questionnaire called LibQUAL+ to determine user satisfaction in the area of service quality and to collect data about use of the physical library. An evaluation was made of the linear relationship between user satisfaction and physical library use, using a Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient statistical analysis.    The results of the analysis indicated statistical significance ( p<.01) and a very low positive correlation (r=.35) between satisfaction and library use. The overall satisfaction mean of the participants was high (7.19 out of 9) and use of the physical library by the participants was high (over 92% of participants indicated using the physical library). The research hypothesis was accepted; however its practical significance is questionable.

T1  - How expert professional nurses practice and develop nurse presence in a critical care unit: A grounded theory study
AN  - 304737767
AB  - The intent of this thesis was to increase understanding of the nurse's presence in clinical nursing practice within the critical care setting. Nurse presence is employed to achieve an enhanced connection with patients and has been described as both being there for and being with the other. Highly technological intensive care environments have the potential to objectify patients and present unique challenges to nursing professionals attempting to integrate this aesthetic art into their care.    Purpose. The purpose of this study was to examine how critical care nurses practice and develop nurse presence with their patients. Method. Grounded theory method was used. Data were obtained from semi-structured interviews with nine expert critical care nurse participants.    Results. Presence as a practice emerged as a three phased process—commitment, presencing strategies and connection. The development of nurse presence as an evolutionary process was gradual, iterative and cumulative and was subject to two major influences—transitional influences and professional influences. Each patient experience with presence contributed to knowing the uniqueness of the individual as a whole person as well as to knowing a richer and deeper understanding of presence as a nursing practice. This integration of the practice and developmental components of this nursing phenomenon is described by the basic social process 'knowing the whole'.    Conclusions. Presencing emerged as a powerful and humanizing, aesthetic element of nursing the critically ill. Unlike previous studies on this concept, the grounded theory method revealed three stages of practicing presence and demonstrated that it is learned.

T1  - Caring and burnout in registered nurses: What's the connection?
AN  - 305292252
AB  - In order to prevent burnout among nurses, key causes of burnout must be identified and targeted for direct intervention. The literature discusses burnout among nurses, focusing on burnout due to task-related variables and not patient-related (caring) variables. Two major problems exist with research on burnout and caring in registered nurses (RNs). The first is the lack of robust methods of research utilized to study the concept of caring. The second is the lack of research on the link between caring and burnout in RNs.    The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between caring and burnout in a sample of RNs in North Carolina. The major hypothesis for this research, was that as RNs report increased levels of caring, they also report higher levels of burnout. Four research questions are addressed in this project.    The population for this study consisted of all RNs within the state of North Carolina. Subjects were selected randomly to obtain a sample of 3,500 to receive a mailed survey. The revised Caring Behaviors Inventory was used to measure the five dimensions of caring (independent variables) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory to measure the three dimensions of burnout (dependent variables). A multiple regression analysis was conducted between each dimension of burnout and four carative factors. This study revealed that the four carative factors identified do impact a nurse's level of burnout and had the greatest impact on the burnout dimension of reduced personal accomplishment. The carative factor of respectful deference for the other contributed the greatest variance in reduced personal accomplishment. Overall, increases in caring led to decreased burnout for this sample.    If nurses can be identified as being predisposed to burnout due to their caring attitudes and behaviors, individual and workplace interventions might be developed and implemented to assist in identifying predisposing factors to burnout and, in turn, reduce or prevent burnout in the future. A reduction in burnout may lead to a higher retention rate for nurses, thereby easing the nursing shortage.

T1  - U -commerce: A tale of two studies
AN  - 305275050
AB  - U-commerce (Ubiquitous commerce) presents a new channel/medium for commerce. The objective of this dissertation is two-fold: (i) to identify the values of u-commerce from the customers' perspectives, and (ii) to empirically examine the factors influencing customers' u-commerce adoption intentions. The dissertation comprises the following two studies. Study One is a qualitative research that identifies the values of u-commerce from the customers' perspectives. The Value-Focused Thinking approach was applied to determine the values of u-commerce to customers and to define the relationships among those values. Study Two is an experimental research that investigates the personalization-privacy paradox in u-commerce. The results of the second study suggest that the effects of personalization on customers' perceived benefits and privacy concerns are situation dependent. This dissertation contributes to u-commerce by developing a conceptual framework to understand the values of u-commerce, and assessing the trade-off relationship between customers' perceived benefits of personalization and their privacy concerns in different contexts. The results of this dissertation not only enhance our understanding of emerging ucommerce phenomenon, but also provide some basic foundations for future research in u-commerce. The results are also valuable to practitioners as they provide useful guidelines for developing and implementing u-commerce.

T1  - The effect of transformational leadership on growth in specialized non -profit organizations: Churches
AN  - 304911834
AB  - In all organizations, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, good leadership has been vital for the success, growth and continuation of the organization. Intuitively, one might feel that leadership has much to do with the success of an organization, but do we apply a particular type of leadership to this intuitive application or merely use the term in a very broad sense? Leadership has been written about extensively for many years, with researchers primarily covering its application in business and educational environments. The purpose of this study has been to determine the degree of Transformational Leadership in a sub-set of the not-for-profit organization, the individual church. More specifically, this study has attempted to determine whether there is a specific leadership style that can be identified on a continuum between transactional leadership and Transformational Leadership that most positively affects the growth of an individual church.    The instrument used for this determination was the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5X) (Bass, 1995). Once this study identified the leader as transformational, transactional, or somewhere in-between, historical records were examined to see whether the leaders who had been identified as transformational leaders made a difference in organizational growth.    This study was unable to show a relationship between Transformational Leadership and Church growth. Other findings with regard to attendance included as available space decreased, attendance seemed to increase. Also, as congregational interest increased in having services to attract both the unchurched and non-members to the worship services more growth was experienced. Findings regarding contributions showed a decrease as the number of senior pastors serving the congregation increased over a ten-year period. Finally, as a pastor aged, contributions appeared to decrease slightly.

T1  - Selecting leadership: An analysis of predictors in assessing leadership potential
AN  - 304910882
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of leadership using a newly developed assessment for leadership selection within the healthcare industry by comparing assessment scores to supervisor rankings of the subjects. The study population consisted of 195 employees of 11 different hospitals. Each of the participants completed the Healthcare Leadership Inventory (HLI) assessment; their immediate supervisors completed performance ratings for them. None of the instruments were designed by the researcher. The dependent variable of the study was the supervisor-provided factor of Promotion Potential. Stepwise multiple regression was the main analytical approach.    The analysis yielded two predictors of leadership success from the HLI assessment (Achievement Orientation and Openness to Change) and five from the Supervisor Ratings (Multi-Tasking, Drive for Results, Self Confidence, Openness to Change, and Customer Orientation). The identified predictors from each instrument had construct symmetry, although they were not statistically duplicative. The predictors from Supervisor Ratings provide some insight into the implicit leadership theories shared by management personnel in the healthcare industry. The HLI assessment factors of Achievement, Conscientiousness, Innovative, and Customer Focus had significant correlations with their counterparts from Supervisor Ratings. The Critical Thinking factor surprisingly did not significantly predict leadership potential or correlate with any of the other factors.

T1  - Evaluating stigma among infertile men and women in Iran
AN  - 1020894174
AB  - Introduction: Psycho-social aspects of physical disability may create more problems for the indi-vidual than the disability itself. The infertile may suffer from misjudgments or prejudices in different situations by their colleagues and relatives. All factors for this suffering can be evaluated in stigma settings which the infertile confront. In addition to these pathological settings, there are some opportunities which infertile people can enjoy for more adaptations with their social envi-ronments. The objective of this study was to become familiarized with different aspects of psycho- social life of the in fertile in the setting of Iranian culture.

              
Materials & Methods: 268 fertile and infertile subjects were involved in this study from two different regions of Iran. Through a considerable number of interviews with infertile individuals in the pilot study, the styles of social interaction with people and also positive and negative cons-tructs related to their social lives were recognized. Utilizing a suitable instrument (Repertory grid) and factor analysis of scores, disability factors concerning social aspects of infertility were disco-vered. Moreover, regression analysis and t-test (p< .05) were used for the analysis of the data.

              
Results: The statistical analysis including t-test, factor and regression analyses indicated that social comparison, as one of the sources for self, has an imminent role in the prediction of psycho-social adjustment of infertile individuals. Meanwhile, the infertile women showed more negative views in the elements "comparison with fertile people" and "my view toward infertility" but both fertile and infertile subjects did not show any significant differences in psychosocial adjustments.

              
Conclusion: From the three sources of self-knowledge, social comparison, social feedback and self-observation, social comparison plays the first role and social feedback the second in the construction of stigma among infertile people. The results of this study showed the necessity of a health-oriented approach in the evaluation of psycho-social aspects of physical disability among infertile people and also the necessity of modifying and equalizing the functions of the three sources of self-knowledge through group therapy sessions.

T1  - Reflection on teaching and the scholarship of teaching: Focus on science instructors
AN  - 740314111
AB  - Reflection on teaching in higher education remains poorly understood. This exploratory study had three goals. First, to test, empirically yet in an exploratory way, the applicability of a particular model of reflection. Second, to identify objective indicators of reflection on knowledge about teaching with the intent to make the process of reflection more concrete, visible, and its outcomes valid. Third, in line with the exploratory nature of the study, to shed light on some variables that might be linked to observed differences in reflection, which could be investigated more systematically through future research. The model of reflection guiding the study was based on Mezirow's transformative learning theory. It distinguishes three kinds of reflection: on content, process and premises. These take place within three domains of knowledge about teaching: instruction, pedagogy, and curriculum. Thirty-six instructors of science participated in a semi-structured interview based on the model and completed a repertory grid, which incorporated their beliefs about teaching as identified through the Approaches of Teaching Inventory (ATI). While all instructors showed evidence of reflection that were in line with the model, differences were observed in the extent or kind of reflection they engaged in. Across all three knowledge domains, premise reflection was observed the least often. Results suggested that years of experience and beliefs about teaching might play a role in the extent to which academics are inclined to engage in reflection. The study also identified concrete indicators of reflection, which could be helpful for academic staff evaluation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Diversity of social support and the well -being of male police officers
AN  - 305007514
AB  - This study was one of the first attempts to explore the relationship between patterns of social support and psychological well-being in a population of police officers. Participants were 155 police officers recruited from thirteen police departments of varying size. The major hypothesis, derived from George Kelly's (1955) theory of personal constructs, was that individuals with more differentiated social support systems would report being happier, having less psychological distress, and being more satisfied with their life circumstances. In addition, it was hypothesized that those officers whose support system includes individuals both inside and outside the police force, would be happier and better adjusted than those with more narrow networks of support. Finally, it was hypothesized that police officers who report having larger support networks would show less depression, less symptomatology, fewer stress behaviors, and more life satisfaction.    A dependency grid technique, derived from Kelly's (1955) theory, was used to test these hypotheses. As predicted, police officers who showed more dependency dispersion, reported greater life satisfaction. On the other hand, tests of the predictions regarding depression and psychological symptomatology did not reach significance. The hypotheses concerning the balance of support resources (from inside and outside the police department) was not supported, perhaps because a bias in the sample prevented those with less balanced resources from participating.    Using the well-known Sarason measure of Social Support (Sarason, Levine, Basham, & Sarason, 1983), it was shown that those officers who report having larger support networks (and being more satisfied with them) also report less depression and more general life satisfaction. This accords with and strengthens the findings of previous research using the Sarason measure. Intercorrelations among the various self-report measures used in the study are presented and discussed.

T1  - Using action research for teacher professional development: Research in science and technology education
AN  - 276446746
AB  - Initial plans for this project called for collaborative action research to be used as a means of providing authenticity to the teacher development process by: (1) giving teacher opportunities to improve their understanding of their subject matter, (2) allowing teachers to improve their own practice, and (3) determining factors which may affect this type of professional development. After some time it became apparent that the collaborative nature of the action research engaged in by the participating teachers needed to be modified. The modified collaboration, termed purposeful action research, was employed through the remainder of the project. Purposeful action reaction can be viewed as a community of teachers  who engage in professional development using  'purposeful' action research as a means of progressive knowledge building around science (and technology) education.    Action research holds the promise of offering science and technology teachers more control of their growth as pedagogical practitioners. However, it appears that teachers need to be exposed to issues that extend beyond the reach of the government imposed curriculum guidelines. During the course of this research project it became clear that purposeful action research was necessary in order to address these issues. This thesis provides a detailed account and a description of the characteristics of purposeful action research in action.    Two teams of elementary and secondary science and technology teachers were formed to work within collaborative communities. These teams identified common pedagogical problems that they agreed to use as the focus of their work. Over the four months duration of the project, the teachers worked together to prepare unit plans, organize lessons and share resources.    The thesis concludes with a reiteration of the aims of the project and a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for science and technology education, teacher professional development, and educational research.

T1  - Making the Processes of Designing Explicit Within an Information Technology Environment
AN  - 722540557
AB  - In this paper, technology is described as involving processes whereby resources are utilised to satisfy human needs or to take advantage of opportunities, to develop practical solutions to problems. This study, set within one type of technology context, information technology, investigated how, through a one semester undergraduate university course, elements of technological processes were made explicit to students. While it was acknowledged in the development and implementation of this course that students needed to learn technical skills, technological skills and knowledge, including design, were seen as vital also, to enable students to think about information technology from a perspective that was not confined and limited to `technology as hardware and software'. This paper describes how the course, set within a three year program of study, was aimed at helping students to develop their thinking and their knowledge about design processes in an explicit way. An interpretive research approach was used and data sources included a repertory grid `survey'; student interviews; video recordings of classroom interactions, audio recordings of lectures, observations of classroom interactions made by researchers; and artefacts which included students' journals and portfolios. The development of students' knowledge about design practices is discussed and reflections upon student knowledge development in conjunction with their learning experiences are made. Implications for ensuring explicitness of design practice within information technology contexts are presented, and the need to identify what constitutes design knowledge is argued.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Meaning -making by involuntarily reassigned employees
AN  - 305328543
AB  - Re-shuffling of employees is a popular method of balancing current mission requirements in fluid organizations. Employee knowledge is a valuable resource lost to downtime as employees make sense after involuntary reassignment. This study served to address the paucity of research on the sensemaking of employees who are involuntarily reassigned within their organizations. This study used meaning making theory to explore the mental models employed by eight Department of Defense employees as they made sense of being involuntarily reassigned. It identifies and describes the content of the mental schemes used by these employees to navigate their environment after the event.    The Self-Q interview methodology proposed by Bougon, Baird, Komocar, and Ross, (1990) is used to elicit the constructs of tacit mental models. The major constructs of sensemaking after involuntary reassignment were Identity, Performance, Management, Others (i.e. co-workers, family, supervisors, etc.) and Emotions.    Contributions to sensemaking (Weick, 1979; 1995) and adult learning theory (Mezirow, 1991; 2000) are suggested. Five implications for HRD practitioners and organizational leaders are discussed. Five recommendations for future research in theory and practice are offered.

T1  - A study of the characteristics of sensemaking in a voluntary nonprofit association
AN  - 305328517
AB  - Sensemaking, the process of making sense and assigning meaning to events, involves the application of stored knowledge and experience (Weick, 1995). Knowledge structures are the repository for the stored information that enables sensemaking.    The purpose of this study was to identify and describe the characteristics of sensemaking as observed in collective knowledge structures. The study extends Weick's (1995) work by more specifically describing the elements of sensemaking and demonstrating them in a non-emergent situation in a nonprofit voluntary association. The study also provides descriptions of the content and structure of the group knowledge structure associated with Weick's (1995) seven characteristics of sensemaking.    The site for the study was a nonprofit trade association in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, in which governance was a shared responsibility that involved paid staff and representative member volunteers who served on boards, councils, and committees. The governing network fulfilled a leadership role. Association membership comprised hospitals and health systems in a defined geographic area.    Established methods of ethnography and naturalistic inquiry (Locke & Golden-Biddle, 1993; Miles & Huberman, 1994; Patton, 1987, 1990)—including observation, interview, and document review—were used to identify and describe the knowledge structures and contents of the elements of sensemaking. In addition, cognitive mapping was used to illustrate and verify the collective knowledge structure.    All seven of Weick's (1995) sensemaking characteristics were observed. However, they were found to be not mutually exclusive, and therefore have limited utility as research variables. Identity was the most frequently observed characteristic and was the dominant concept in the knowledge structure, suggesting that there may be a hierarchy within the characteristics of sensemaking that has not been fully identified. Dialogue, in the forms of talk and text (Boden, 1994; Taylor & Van Every, 2000), was shown to be the principle mechanism for making sense and for building and accessing collective knowledge structures. Dialogue also was shown to be instrumental in the development of organizational structure.

T1  - A study of the relationship between consumers' risk perception, information, and knowledge to assess product safety, business policies, and government regulation: Wireless cellular phone uncertainty as a public health hazard
AN  - 305238159
AB  - Product safety in the wireless telecommunication industry for the past decade continues today as a dark cloud over an industry faced with uncertainty. Cellular telephone technology has grown worldwide in multi-cultures, as consumers perceive the value of such devices to be part of their everyday lives. Uncertain conclusive scientific evidence on radio frequency radiation exposure from wireless devices being hazardous to consumers' health has many researchers, manufacturers, politicians, lobbyists, lawyers, and journalists assessing risk for consumers. The proposed research investigated consumer attitudes toward wireless telecommunication marketing and consumerism. The general purpose of the research was to add to the body of knowledge in perceived risk and how consumers act upon the construct of perceived risk, and the relationship between consumers' perceived risk, information, and knowledge in the wireless product domain. Four specific issues explored are: (1) philosophy of the wireless business, (2) product quality and safety, (3) consumer responsibilities, and (4) government regulation. The hypotheses were formulated from research questions, which then adapted into two categories, risk perception by consumers and information medium. The hypotheses were designed by the statement of the alternative hypothesis (which is followed by the null hypothesis). The research questions were used to formulate discovery to the discrepancy between the information a consumer needs to use a product safety and the product information available to consumers. A sample of one hundred adults was administered the modified Barksdale and Darden (1972) questionnaire. Cronbach alpha coefficients were .67, .61, .58, .60, .64, and .64 for the six constructs, respectively. Additional statistical analysis found significant positive paired sample correlations with consumer risk, information and health risk associated with product safety. Perhaps the greatest contribution that this research has offered is asking consumers how they perceive risk when uncertainty exists in the wireless industry. Risk perception research from Slovic (1987) has documented this point (not specifically to wireless products), but has demonstrated that a layperson's concerns about risk are indeed sensitive to various attributes or characteristics. These attributes are the voluntariness of exposure, the potential for catastrophe, and the newness of a technology. The research presented in this doctoral dissertation has found similar characteristics that were positively correlated to interwoven constructs of risk perception and information with products in the wireless domain. A future research direction for researchers is the exploration of consumer behavior using wireless products when issues such as information, knowledge, and regulation for product safety still exist for the industry.

T1  - Differences in goal orientations and competitive attitudes of community college students: An analysis by generation, gender, race/ethnic background, and family life cycle
AN  - 305222918
AB  - This quantitative study tested whether there would be significant differences in competitiveness and goal orientation of full-time business students at Everett Community College by generation, gender, race/culture, and stage of family life cycle, and whether there would be a significant relationship between competitiveness and goal orientation. The Work Domain Goal Orientation Instrument, the Revised Competitiveness Index, and the Personal Development Competitive Attitude questionnaire were completed by 287 participants, comprising 67% of the study population. The results of one-way ANOVA partially supported the hypotheses. Multiple pairwise comparisons indicated that Generation Y and singles without children had a stronger desire to compete, both to win over others and as a personal development experience, than Baby Boomers and those in later stages of the family life cycle. Generation Y desired to compete to win over others more than Generation X. These findings contradict existing theory that Generation Y values personal development and participation over personal achievement or comparison to others and that Baby Boomers continue to be more fixated on self-improvement and individual accomplishment than other generations. Men enjoyed competition more than women, but predominantly as an opportunity for self-development rather than to win. Men had a stronger desire to avoid situations in which their competence could be disproved than women. Those born and raised in the United States, regardless of race, had a stronger desire to compete to win over others than those from other cultures. Asian/Pacific Islanders had a stronger desire to prove their competence to others than Caucasians and American Indians, regardless of the country in which they were born and raised. Since the characteristics of the study population are similar to the national profile of community colleges, the findings may be useful in understanding differences in goal orientation and competitiveness of community college students nationwide. Competing to win and competing for personal development were not found to be mutually exclusive constructs, that is, they coexisted in study participants.

T1  - Mapping risk, strategy, and performance in IPO organizational knowledge structures
AN  - 305483544
AB  - In this dissertation I investigate initial public offering prospectuses to examine institutionalized outcomes about risk and strategy and test whether information about those outcomes can be used to predict firm performance. I use three conceptual perspectives—managerial risk, New Institutional theory, and Organizational Cognition—to explore these outcomes in the main body of this thesis. The main body contains four articles that, although connected by a common thread, are designed as independent standalone papers. In Chapter 2 I examine the risk factor section of 529 prospectuses from firms that went public of US stock exchanges in 1995 and 1996. Using this data I create a comprehensive content cognitive map of 98 risk factors at represent the content of IPO field's risk knowledge structure. I then identify three methods for measuring these risk factors—pervasiveness, priority, and proportion. Following this I examine how the IPO field structures the risk knowledge structure. In Chapter 3 I use the content map developed in Chapter 2 to test whether I can use this information to predict firm performance. Using the IPO data, I develop several risk measures and compare these to existing proxy measures. I then use multiple regression analyses to test the reliability and validity of the various measures. The final result is a risk factor measure, the BROAD measure, which produced the most consistent results. In Chapter 4 I expand the investigation by examining how firms and fields make sense of strategy and how it relates to the risk factors. In this chapter I compare three fields with differing levels of institutionalization to see whether I can find unique institutionalized outcomes—industry recipes—about risk and strategy. In this Chapter I find strong support for the idea that fields have distinctive industry recipes. The results show that the dynamics of these industry recipes differ according to the level and type of institutionalization. Finally, in Chapter 5 I test firm level cognitive maps against the field level industry recipes to examine whether conformity, convergence, or divergence matter to IPO performance. There is some support for the idea that firm conformity to an industry recipe improves firm performance. Additionally, in some institutional conditions, convergence toward an industry recipe also improves IPO performance.

T1  - Two essays on information acquisition and consideration set formation: Effects of lower search costs on consumer welfare
AN  - 304801720
AB  - The emergence of the Internet has introduced consumers to many products and services that previously were either unknown to them or unattainable due to prohibitively high search costs. Dealing with this vast number of alternatives intensifies the need for smart tools that can screen options on behalf of the consumer, recommending only the most fitting options. This dissertation explores how quality screening tools affect consumers' consideration sets and choices from ordered environments.    Essay 1 shows how quality screening tools affect consumers' price sensitivity. Recent consumer research suggests that lowering search costs for quality information reduces consumer price sensitivity by creating greater perceived differentiation among brands (e.g., Kaul and Wittink 1995; Lynch and Ariely 2000). However, this dissertation argues that lowering quality search costs by using smart agents can have the opposite effect on differentiation and price sensitivity. Smart agents screen through a universe of alternatives, recommending only a handful well-matched to the customer's quality preferences. Experiments 1 and 2 show that in markets in which price and quality are uncorrelated, screening agents decrease differentiation and prices paid compared to searching from an unordered list of options. Also, increasing the size of the store's underlying assortment decreases differentiation and prices paid when options have been screened on quality.    Essay 2 focuses on consumers' search and selection process from ordered lists. A good ordering tool decreases the benefits of additional search, since finding better options by searching lower ranked options is unlikely. Therefore, factors that increase search do not yield any benefits in terms of finding better options, but rather dilute the effectiveness of ordering tools by lowering the quality of the consideration set. Several factors that may trigger search behavior are investigated, such as low search cost, number of recommendations made and consumers' desire to be accurate. Findings from three experiments show that increased search from ordered lists decreases consideration set quality and ultimately leads to worse choices. Results demonstrate that for tools to undo these negative effects it is crucial to decrease consumers' search from ordered lists and to enhance the quality of the consideration set.

AN  - 216173795
AB  - This article examines the issue of priority setting in Third World agricultural research organizations, for those research sectors and topics which - mainly because of the difficulty of quantifying benefits - are outside the domain of economic surplus and benefit/cost techniques. The issue is redefined as one of processing ill-structured decisions, i.e., decisions in which there is no unique, identifiable, objectively optimal solution. The implications of this for the concept of rational action in this field are explored, and the results used to define a practical approach. This centres on a radical review of the possible options and criteria in priority setting, using four techniques (challenge groups, repertory grid, creativity techniques and flow charting). The final section of the article examines the decision-making aspects of these techniques in three priority-setting contexts of increasing difficulty: within a department, where the issue is essentially one of technical choice between competing research lines; within a major institute or research sector, where there is substantial competition for resources; and in an institute or sector which is facing a crisis of resources or relevance.

T1  - Understanding patients' preferences for treatment: the need for innovative methodologies
AN  - 1778769946
AB  - Treatment selection is now much more consumer driven than in the past. However, there is a need to develop investigative methodological approaches that are sensitive to differences in patient preferences if full account is to be taken of what the patient sees as the best option in terms of different possible treatments available for a particular condition. Previous attitude research has been criticised because it does not provide insight into reasons why people hold different preferences or beliefs. A methodology is described which allows people to describe their concerns and values associated with different treatment options in their own words. This is the repertory grid method of eliciting personal constructs used in conjunction with generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA). An example of the use of this methodology is provided, drawn from research directed towards understanding people's beliefs about genetic technologies. A possible application of the method to understanding treatment preferences related to type 2 diabetes is also discussed. It is concluded that the use of innovative methodologies is essential if our understanding of patient preferences regarding treatment options is to have a significant impact on patient quality of life.

T1  - Religious commitment and the construal of sources of help for emotional problems
AN  - 218915027; 11003370
AB  - Religious commitment as an influence upon seeking help for psychological problems has not received the same level of research attention as variables such as sex, ethnicity and cultural background. The construing of members of a group of committed UK Christians was investigated, regarding their receiving such help from a variety of different helpers, professional and non-professional, secular and spiritual. Each participant was asked to interpret the factors statistically identified from construct and element relationships in a repertory grid that they had completed. Their commentaries formed the data for a qualitative thematic analysis, which gave rise to four main themes. From these, a tentative model is discussed. Possible implications for the acceptance of service provision by the substantial minority groups of religiously committed people in the UK are considered in the light of this model--and in the light of the further research that would be needed to establish it.

T1  - Personal constructs of male survivors of childhood sexual abuse receiving cognitive analytic therapy
AN  - 218934262; 10874477
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed whether male survivors of sexual abuse identified with their abusers rather than their child- or victim-selves and failed to identify with men in general or with their victims, following abusive 'acting out'. Changes in both identification and symptomatology were assessed following cognitive analytic therapy. DESIGN: A patient series within-participants design was used. METHOD: A repertory grid methodology examined four male survivors self-construals before and after therapy. Measures of symptomatic distress, depression, self-esteem and distorted beliefs related to childhood sexual abuse were also obtained. RESULTS: Before therapy, patients showed little identification with the child-selves, men in general and ideal-selves. Two heterosexual patients identified with their abuser(s) whereas another, homosexual, patient negatively identified with his abuser. Patients did not identify with their victims following aggressive 'acting out'. After therapy, identification with the abuser reduced markedly; identification with victim- and ideal-self increased. Depression and distorted beliefs declined. CONCLUSION: Male survivors tend to identify with abusers and disavow their victim-hood. Sexual orientation may predict identification patterns. Cognitive analytic therapy may be a promising method of enabling survivors to integrate their abuse experience and reduce their commitment to the abuser role.

T1  - Organizational change schemas: An empirical investigation of how health care managers make sense of organizational change
AN  - 304514130
AB  - This research examined the structural properties of individual’s organizational change schemas. An organizational change schema is a particular sensemaking framework that contains knowledge about organizational change, including change attributes and relations among those attributes. Understanding the properties of these schemas is important because existing research suggests that the way individuals think about change influences their responses to it.    Specifically, the present study investigated health care managers’ sensemaking regarding implementation of a quality initiative by examining: (1) the structure and content of organizational change schemas; (2) the extent to which schemas were shared by organizational members; and (3) the nature of the relationship between shared understanding and organizational inertia.    A sample of 28 health care managers from a large hospital in the Northeastern U.S. completed the repertory grid, a method originating in cognitive psychology (Kelly, 1955). This method allowed organizational members to identify meaningful dimensions that distinguished between organizational change attributes while minimizing the imposition of the researcher’s frame of reference. The content and structure of members’ change schemas were also examined using a pre-designed instrument by Lau and Woodman (1995).    Content analysis revealed that in their effort to make sense of organizational change, organizational members rely on a relatively small number of widely shared evaluative dimensions, and a larger number of essentially idiosyncratic dimensions. An analysis of change schemas by organizational level revealed important differences in the way top managers and middle managers make sense of change. The results of cluster analysis indicated that discrete shared organizational change schemas could be identified and meaningfully understood in terms of current and ideal orientations. Contrary to expectations, incongruence between members’ current and ideal change schemas did not give rise to negative emotions. However, incongruence between these schemas was positively related to resistance to change. Comparison of the two methods used in this study suggests that the preservation of the terms and dimensions people themselves use to describe organizational change represents an important consideration for future cognitive-based organizational change research. Implications for theory and practice as well as directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - Expectations of an exercise prescription scheme: An exploratory study using repertory grids
AN  - 2126529876
AB  - Objectives. The study aimed to investigate in depth the personal constructs relating to exercise of individuals referred by their medical practitioner for a 10‐week gym‐based exercise programme. It further aimed to study the expectations of change on these constructs and the extent to which these predicted adherence. A subsidiary aim was to evaluate the usefulness of repertory grid methodology in the exercise context.Design. This was a longitudinal study.Methods. Participants were interviewed at the start of the 10‐week exercise programme. During the interview they completed repertory grids designed to elicit constructs about exercise‐related change. Participants were followed up at three months to check adherence.Results. Three illustrative individual case studies are presented in detail followed by some aggregated analyses. These suggest that expectations of change were very diverse and often overoptimistic. Those who completed their course of exercise had more modest expectations of change than those who failed to complete. They also showed less gulf between their current view of themselves and their view of themselves as they would like to be.Conclusions. The study suggests that having realistic aims and understanding of the outcomes that can be expected from a brief exercise programme is an important predictor of success, but one that may currently be overlooked in the enthusiasm to implement exercise prescription schemes.

T1  - School Guidance Focus: A Hong Kong Study
AN  - 1969999127
AB  - School guidance focus: a Hong Kong Study
As schools worldwide pay more attention to pastoral care and pupil guidance research into guidance focus as a school factor and ways of assessing it are still undeveloped. The study reported here aimed at identifying the guidance focus (remedial, preventive or developmental) adopted in Hong Kong secondary schools. In the absence of previous studies, it was necessary to establish criteria of identification. Constructs of guidance were first identified using Kelly's Repertory Grid. This was followed by a questionnaire survey of guidance practices. The findings indicated that case work and developmental group work were useful indicators. The criteria established for assessing schools' guidance focus were the amount of time spent by the school guidance team and the priority they assigned to each indicator. The findings also revealed conceptual and methodological problems in determining school guidance focus and in categorising schools accordingly, thus opening up other areas of research. While specific to Hong Kong secondary schools, the method is reported for its relevance to other school settings.

T1  - Hostility, heart disease threat appraisal and quality of life after treatment for heart disease
AN  - 304423169
AB  - Lazarus' Stress, Appraisal and Coping Theory was used to examine hostility, appraisal and adaptational outcomes in patients undergoing diagnosis and subsequent treatment for heart disease. Adaptational outcomes assessed in this study were affect, quality of life, activity status and risk reduction behavior. The mediator effect of heart disease threat appraisal on the relationship between hostility before diagnosis, and quality of life after treatment was examined.    72 patients were enrolled prior to diagnostic angiogram (Time 1); 35 patients were followed up immediately after the initiation of treatment (Time 2) and again at one month post-treatment (Time 3). Participants followed up included those receiving either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft or medication treatment for coronary artery disease or left ventricular dysfunction.    At the time of enrollment, participants completed questionnaires assessing hostility, affect, heart disease threat appraisal, state anxiety, quality of life, activity status and risk factors for heart disease, as well as demographic information. At Time 2, participants completed a benefit of treatment appraisal. At Time 3, participants received mailed questionnaires which re-evaluated variables from Time 1, and which also examined risk reduction behavior after treatment.    The results revealed that there is a significant, positive relationship between hostility and appraisal of heart disease threat, a significant, negative relationship between heart disease threat and quality of life and a significant, negative relationship between state anxiety and quality of life. These relationships were significant both cross-sectionally and over time. Additionally, findings lend tentative support to the theory-defined role of heart disease threat as a mediator between hostility and significance testing, the findings indicate that both anxiety and appraisal of heart disease threat may motivate risk reduction behavior.

T1  - Identity and the Baby Bells: Applying structuration theory to strategic management
AN  - 304367058
AB  - Current theories in strategic management provide limited explanations for firm differences and in general bypass the question, 'Why this particular strategy?'. This dissertation draws upon Structuration Theory and research on organizational identity to improve understanding of firm differences and strategic transformation. It argues that Structuration Theory answers questions about how strategic differences evolve and organizational identity explains why organizations take the directions they take.    The 1984 divestiture of the Bell System provides a natural experiment in the business world to investigate research questions about firm differences. One of the world largest corporations was broken apart into seven autonomous units to provide local telephone service. Despite initial similarities in internal and external environments, ten years later the Baby Bells look and act very different from each other. To explore basic research question about these difference, a multiple case, multiple level research design is used. Three organizations are investigated: U S WEST, Pacific Telesis Group, and Ameritech. One organization, U S WEST, is investigated in detail and at multiple levels.    Results of the investigation show that managers at the organizations show a conviction in the correctness of their organization's strategy and the fallibility of the paths of the other Baby Bells beyond what would be expected. Recognizing that U S WEST identifies itself as a multimedia company and Pacific Telesis and Ameritech identify themselves as telecommunication companies, contributes to our understanding of strategic differences. Some of the variance in perceptions of the identity was explained by the result that identity beliefs depend, in part, on job level and division employed in the company.    Other contributions of this dissertation include the introduction of Structuration Theory, a robust sociological theory, to the field of strategic management. In addition, organizational identity is explored to a new depth of understanding by clarifying the difference in organizational identity and organizational culture and by offering a new definition of organizational identity. A procedure for measuring senior managers shared sense of their organization and how to evaluate the extent that this sense is shared among other employees is presented. This dissertation has implications for managers as well as scholars.

T1  - A structural equation approach to strategic groups, competitive strategies, and performance: A hospital analysis
AN  - 304033480
AB  - What strategies do hospitals follow? What role do market factors play in a hospital's strategy and performance? The purpose of this dissertation is to provide empirical evidence of competitive strategies used by hospitals, and to introduce a structural equation model as a data-analytic method for studying hospital strategic groups. By using a competitive strategy typology, a priori rationale for expected strategies and groupings of hospitals can be developed. Financial information from 87 Arizona hospitals was used in this study. Results suggest groups of hospitals do follow similar strategies and the four competitive strategies used in this study--scope, differentiation, cost efficiency, and asset parsimony--do reflect strategies used by hospitals. The degree of competition does seem to influence the type of competitive strategy followed. The study also found some competitive strategies are more successful than others. Hospitals following a cost efficiency strategy have the potential to achieve higher performance levels than those hospitals following scope, differentiation, or asset parsimony strategies.

T1  - Teachers' practical knowledge in a nurse educator
AN  - 304020862
AB  - Practical knowledge comprises a complex set of understandings held by individual teachers. It is derived from unique ways of thinking and appears to be influenced largely by personal experience. In this research, inquiry was directed toward the identification and articulation of this knowledge held by a nurse educator. A qualitative research design best suited the goal of obtaining rich descriptions. The case study method was selected for data collection and interview questions were developed from the research and theoretical literature. Interview sessions were semi-structured to enable the subject to express views and experiences freely. In addition, the subject was observed in teaching sessions. Data analysis elucidated underlying themes from the subject's responses. These themes were categorized into concepts which had been identified as components of practical knowledge held by teachers. The ongoing influence of experience and role awareness appeared to affect the evolution of the subject's practical knowledge of teaching. Conclusions from this study reveal that teachers' practical knowledge is cyclical in nature. The theoretical structure of this knowledge reveals it to be comprised at least of Thinking (What teachers think), Synthesis (What teachers do), and Activation (How teachers teach). Information on teachers' practical knowledge should offer individual instructors increased insight into what it is that shapes their teaching activities. A major implication from the research is that teachers should be encouraged to participate in self-reflection for the purpose of recognizing their practical knowledge, and to evaluate and revise their teaching. Teachers also should find beneficial the value of their past experiences and the worth of their intuitive thinking as related to instructional settings. Recommendations regarding faculty development and graduate education for future nursing faculty were presented. In addition, recommendations for further research were advanced.

T1  - Etude préliminaire de l'abus sexuel précoce
AN  - 1969736706
AB  - The long term effects of sexual abuse are often measured by measuring behaviours such as social adjustment, job stability and marriage. This study was conducted to add to these internal measures. Using a semi-prospective instrument adapted from G. Kelly's repertory grid, the adolescents' perceptions of themselves and significant others are measured. Three hundred and twelve female adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19 (average age = 16) participated in the study; 79 presented with non sexual behaviour disorders (delinquency, stealing, etc.), 56 presented with serious sexual behaviour disorders (prostitution, persistant sexual promiscuity) and 177 presented with no problems requiring psychosocial intervention. Various analyses (descriptive, multiple variance, regression analysis) showed that sexual abuse significantly affects many of the adolescents' perceptions. Sexually abused adolescents perceived their two real parents as less competent and their ideal mother and father as less protective than adolescents who had not been abused. In contrast, their perception of self and the ideal self was not affected by the sexual abuse, a finding which will spark discussion.

T1  - A study of the relation between life tasks defined by older adults and their perceptions of well-being
AN  - 303911157
AB  - This study explored how older adults structure their lives. Based on personal construct theory, I suggested that individuals develop a life plan which consists of life tasks, task-associated activities, and a structure defined by the interaction between these tasks and activities. The two research questions focused on (1) the categorization of life tasks and (2) the relation between the life plan structure, defined as the congruency between tasks and task-associated activities, and psychological well-being.    A sample of 54 older adults residing in the community completed a Task- Activity Form and four measures of psychological well-being: environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others and purpose in life (Ryff, 1989b). A subsample of 20 subjects also completed an interactive computer rating program (Lehrer, 1988) pairing subjects' life tasks with their task-associated activities. Using an iterative process, eight categories were derived representing the common life tasks encountered by these older adults. These categories are: maintaining and nurturing family relationships; building and maintaining friendships; maintaining and managing household and property; maintaining one's health; maintaining one's spiritual life and participating in church activities; service to others through church/community/personal activities; maintaining financial stability; and, hobbies, recreational activities, and learning opportunities. The average number of different categories per subject was 4.3 (sd = 1.2) and at least 50% of the subjects listed one or more tasks in six of the nine categories.    A significant correlation was found between the number of tasks and the well-being dimension of personal growth for males and between this same dimension and the number of activities for both males and females. This relation suggests that life tasks which focus on new experiences and knowledge expansion appear to be associated with positive feelings of personal growth in later life.    No significant relations were found between any of the four well-being measures and measures of task-activity congruency.

T1  - The Brightest and the Best: Factors Influencing the Retention or Withdrawal of Completing Teachers
AN  - 1979058489
AB  - Allegations that the most able simply intend to leave teaching were challenged by qualitative and quantitative data collected from 147 prospective teachers completing their credentialling diploma. A conceptual framework combining personal construct and social learning theories modelled the influences of personal, academic and social factors on intended persistence. A single line version of the repertory grid elicited reasons for intended persistence or withdrawal which were coded into 11 categories supported by the literature. A multiple classification analysis showed that those who were confident of promotion and who were committed to and satisfied by teaching intended persisting. While the findings were less clear for psychological constructs and for academic and social integration, some of the best prospective teachers intended staying for at least five years. The course itself was well received.

T1  - Important Dimensions of Strategic Issues: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
AN  - 194221024; 00465955
AB  - Decision makers must use dimensions to sort the wheat from the chaff in the field of potential strategic issues.  The dimensions implied by 3 literatures and dimensions generated by an empirical study are compared.  A search of the 3 literatures identified 26 dimensions that differentiate strategic issues.  Repertory grid techniques were used to identify the range of attributes used to define the "meaning space" for strategic issues in a sample of strategic decision makers at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  Dimensions in the literature overlap those in the empirical study; 13 dimensions accounted for 51% of the frequency with which all attributes were mentioned over all respondents.  However, these 13 dimensions exclude the one cited most often in the literature - immediacy.  Also, marked differences in the relative importance of classes of dimensions emerged in the sample relative to the literature.  Issue content was about 3 times as prevalent in the sample, action was about the same in both, analytic characteristics were almost twice as prevalent in the literature, and source did not emerge in the sample at all.

T1  - Sex Role Stereotypes, Gender Identity and Parental Relationships in Male Homosexuals and Heterosexuals
AN  - 204974710; SFLNSPJHX1299JHGW598000006
AB  - The sex-role stereotypes held by heterosexual and homosexual men were examined by comparing their Repertory Grid scores. It was found that homosexual men held less rigid sex-role stereotypes than heterosexuals. Degree of opposite-sex identification was marginally greater in homosexuals, but neither group showed strong masculine or feminine stereotypic identification. Homosexual men perceived themselves as psychologically more distant from their fathers than did their heterosexual counterparts; this was probably an effect of homosexuality rather than a cause.

T1  - An Algorithm for the Cluster Analysis of Repertory Grids in Human Resource Development
AN  - 214807914; 00196950
AB  - The Repertory Grid can be used as a descriptive technique for describing the construct systems of varied respondents across a range of applications.  An analysis of the basic grid and its variations in the area of personnel management and training demonstrated its strengths and weaknesses.  The primary advantage of grids is that they are a powerful way to describe individual cases, giving a detailed account of data from an individual employee.  The main disadvantage of grids is that they generate large amounts of idiosyncratic data that are less useful for statistical analysis.  One method of cluster analysis used in occupational settings is Focus.  In its original form as a computer program, Focus results in easily interpretable information from single grids; in its aggregated version, Sociogrid, Focus lends itself to the interpretation of sets of grids.  The cluster analysis is presented as an algorithm for computation by hand in a nonstatistical, straightforward format with some illustrative case material to suggest its applicability in personnel practice.
