T1  - Relationship journeys in the internet of things: a new framework for understanding interactions between consumers and smart objects
AN  - 2117034072
AB  - Consumers’ interactions with smart objects have a relational nature, and extensive research has supported the “relationship metaphor” as a fruitful way to understand consumer responses to consumption objects. But, smart objects pose unique challenges for considering the emergence of consumer–object relationships, because their degrees of agency, autonomy, and authority lend them their own unique capacities for interaction. We present a new framework for consumer–object relationships based on the circumplex model of interpersonal complementarity and situated in assemblage theory and object-oriented ontology. Consumer–object relationship styles are defined in terms of two foundational dimensions of behavior, agency, and communion, based on the expressive roles played by consumer and object. The overlay of assemblage theory provides a conceptually rich understanding of the space of master–servant, partner, and unstable relationship styles, along with their concomitant positive (enabling) versus negative (constraining) consumer experiences. The model’s underlying geometry supports extensive empirical work and provides a powerful managerial framework for measuring and tracking consumer–object relationships and the journeys they take over time.

T1  - Professional development learning environments (PDLEs) embedded in a collaborative online learning environment (COLE): Moving towards a new conception of online professional learning
AN  - 1999279842
AB  - Teaching, and education in general, remain firmly rooted in the practices of the past and continue to resist the implementation of strategies and theories arising from educational research. Consequently, significant reforms have been slow to take hold in educational systems around the world. Much of the reluctance can be attributed to a widely-held misconception of the nature of learning. This project attempts to address this misconception through the development of Professional Development Learning Environments (PDLEs are a series of learning tasks and a video-based case study) embedded in an online learning environment that requires the collaboration of users to solve problems. To use a Problem-Based-Learning (PBL) approach in an online context requires a major paradigm shift as well as using tools that were not designed specifically for such a student-driven, process-centred pedagogical paradigm. This becomes a problem when online resources and systems are used for supporting in-service teacher in their pursuit of furthering their education. Although the current theories of learning and teaching may present the philosophical content of such courses, the online strategies used often conflict with the theory. To study the formal implementation of PBL as a social-constructivist pedagogical approach, into an online learning environment to provide the tools for e-learning that would be closer in design to the current thinking on the very nature of learning, the PDLEs were modified to become small reusable video clips with a structure designed to facilitate PBL and focus learners’ attention on higher order thinking skills rather than specifically on content. These modified PDLEs are referred to as Problem-Based Learning Objects (PBLOs). The PBLOs were embedded into a prototype of a Collaborative Online Learning Environment (COLE) which was developed simultaneously. The entire system was pilot tested with small groups. Preliminary results show that although many technical difficulties remain to be solved, using the environment does show evidence of some effect on beliefs about personal theories of learning, causing shifts from technical issues to those surrounding processes of learning. Our preliminary research has called attention to the potential ability of PBLO/COLE to disrupt conventional, transmission-based conceptions of online learning as content delivery. At the same time, however, our preliminary work has also indicated that learners who are not used to the collaborative opportunities provided within PBLO/COLE may still hold traditional orientations to teaching and learning as a “gold standard” to which all other options are compared. A purposeful direction for our future research will entail working with learners in PBLO/COLE over a sustained period so that they may engage in an online experience grounded in principles of socio-constructivism.

T1  - Achievement of desired university graduate attributes through a new 4-year undergraduate program
AN  - 2273102178
AB  - This study investigated how the new 4-year undergraduate program, particularly the "General University Requirements" (GUR) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) contributed to the development of five desired graduate attributes amongst students of PolyU, including critical thinking, effective communication, innovative problem solving, lifelong learning and ethical leadership. The findings based on different evaluation methods, including longitudinal survey studies, Collegiate Learning Assessment Plus, secondary analyses of Student Feedback Questionnaire data, qualitative evaluation studies, longitudinal case study and repertory grid test evaluation are first summarized. Based on the findings, the question of whether the 4-year program contributed to the development of desired graduate attributes was explored. Integration of the available evaluation findings suggests that the GUR has helped the undergraduate students to develop the graduate attributes and the new 4-year undergraduate programme can promote the holistic development of the students.

T1  - Parasocial Interactions and Relationships with Media Characters–An Inventory of 60 Years of Research
AN  - 2238970268
AB  - [...]with a view to providing better understanding of the contexts of research on parasocial phenomena, we offer a short general view regarding the overall results and patterns of the studies.

[...]this overview will address the limitations of research on parasocial phenomena and offer some new ideas on how to investigate parasocial phenomena in the future. 1.Background A.Definition of concepts In the past 60 years, and especially at the beginning of research into parasocial phenomena, different definitions and usages of the terms "parasocial interaction" (PSI) as well as "parasocial relationship" (PSR) emerged that led to a broad understanding of the construct but also to some ambiguity.

[...]unlike PSI, PSR can-much like real social relationships- endure beyond a single reception and develop into a long-term relationship between a media user and a media character (e.g., Schramm, 2008).

[...]after we know, as far as possible, the temporal development of a research field as well as the topics that occupied center stages in the studies, we need to examine how researchers actually conducted the research work.

[...]our last research focus concentrates on the question: "Which insights on parasocial phenomena did we gain due to these studies?" We will address this question by taking a closer look at the characteristics of the media users and of the media characters that influence the development of parasocial phenomena.

[...]we will attend to other reception phenomena that accompany parasocial phenomena and the effects mediated or influenced by parasocial phenomena. 2.Methodological procedure The following section describes the methodological procedure, from the initial search up to the selection and exclusion of certain publications, and the subsequent categorization and arrangement of the studies.

AB  - Der vorliegende Beitrag befasst sich mit dem Einfluss von EU-spezifischem politischen Wissen auf die Legitimitätswahrnehmung der Europäischen Union (EU). Die Literatur zur Einstellungsforschung lässt sowohl einen positiven als auch einen negativen Einfluss erwarten. Mit Hilfe eines quasi-experimentellen Designs mit Repertory Grid liefert dieser Beitrag Hinweise für einen negativen Zusammenhang von EU-spezifischem politischen Wissen. Mit zunehmendem EU-spezifischem politischen Wissen nahm die Legitimitätswahrnehmung ab. Gleichzeitig gewannen aber demokratische Normen und Werte in der Wahrnehmung der Befragten an Bedeutung, so dass sich für die Befragtengruppe das Phänomen der critical citizens zeigt, in deren Augen individueller normativer Standard und Wirklichkeit auseinandergehen.

T1  - Is Scoring Helpful Feedback for Writing Tasks? An Examination of Teachers' Beliefs
AN  - 2135500065
AB  - Understanding teachers' beliefs about scoring procedures can be beneficial for educators in order to understand factors including challenges the teachers face when dealing with writing evaluation. This study investigated teachers' beliefs about scoring procedures through the narrative approach. Their stories were revealed through repertory grid interviews based on the Personal Construct Theory. The method encouraged teachers to think more critically when expressing their beliefs, so their genuine voices and experiences could be revealed. Two native and two non-native English-speaking teachers at the university level were interviewed about their methods of assigning scores when evaluating an essay. The interviews revealed that several factors, such as learning, practicality, experience, objectivity, and confidence could influence teachers' beliefs when deciding which scoring procedures to use. The challenges that educators might face when giving feedback were also discussed.

T1  - What do aircraft accident investigators do and what makes them good at it? Developing a competency framework for investigators using grounded theory
AN  - 2018027169
AB  - We present a new analysis of the tasks carried out by air accident investigators and propose a new competency framework which captures the competencies demanded of an effective investigator. Using a subject-matter expert panel, a hierarchical task analysis (HTA) was developed to frame and organise the diverse activities that are required of the air accident investigator. Supported by the HTA, a competency framework was developed using structured interviews based on repertory-grid interview technique. Grounded theory was used to abstract competencies derived from the interviews. The resultant competency framework could be applied to selection and training future investigators in other safety critical domains. More immediately, the framework can deliver insight into what differentiates the good investigator from the excellent investigator.

T1  - A Multimodal Deep Log-Based User Experience (UX) Platform for UX Evaluation
AN  - 2108720884
AB  - The user experience (UX) is an emerging field in user research and design, and the development of UX evaluation methods presents a challenge for both researchers and practitioners. Different UX evaluation methods have been developed to extract accurate UX data. Among UX evaluation methods, the mixed-method approach of triangulation has gained importance. It provides more accurate and precise information about the user while interacting with the product. However, this approach requires skilled UX researchers and developers to integrate multiple devices, synchronize them, analyze the data, and ultimately produce an informed decision. In this paper, a method and system for measuring the overall UX over time using a triangulation method are proposed. The proposed platform incorporates observational and physiological measurements in addition to traditional ones. The platform reduces the subjective bias and validates the user’s perceptions, which are measured by different sensors through objectification of the subjective nature of the user in the UX assessment. The platform additionally offers plug-and-play support for different devices and powerful analytics for obtaining insight on the UX in terms of multiple participants.

The purpose of this article is to identify qualities that define a successful CIO, based on organizational cognition, and contingent on context and organizational maturity. A qualitative approach is used based on the Theory of Personal Constructs and the cognitive mapping tool called Repertory Grid. Three dimensions of qualities were identified, prominent among them the personal and interpersonal type. The study confirms the importance of the understanding of assumptions, values, expectations and individual beliefs in the interpretation and meaning of constructs related to the impact of information technologies in the organization.

T1  - Technology-driven service strategy
AN  - 1951518462
AB  - Advancements in technology are radically transforming service, and increasingly providing the underlying basis for service strategy. In this paper, we develop a typology and positioning map for service strategy, in the context of rapid technological change, and outline the process for firms to position or reposition their service strategies. Which strategy to choose is based on the degree to which customer demand is heterogeneous, and the degree to which potential customer lifetime value varies across customers. This results in four strategies: the McService strategy that is standardized and transactional, the Relational Service strategy that is standardized and relational, the Customized Transaction strategy that is personalized and transactional, and the Adaptive Personalization strategy that is personalized and relational. We provide firms a roadmap for identifying a “sweet spot” strategy in relation to a segment’s realized or potential customer lifetime value, combined with the firm’s technological capabilities. Because technological capabilities inevitably advance, firms will tend to move from standardized to personalized and from transactional to relational over time, implying that firms should be alert to technological opportunities to personalize their relationships with customers. Our strategic framework also produces a useful bridge from marketing practice to the conceptual evolution of the service literature, showing how the historical trends toward continuing customer relationships and co-productive personalization should drive strategic thinking in service.

T1  - Customer experience management: toward implementing an evolving marketing concept
AN  - 1881682533
AB  - Although research continues to debate the future of the marketing concept, practitioners have taken the lead, appraising customer experience management (CEM) as one of the most promising marketing approaches in consumer industries. In research, however, the notion of CEM is not well understood, is fragmented across a variety of contexts, and is insufficiently demarcated from other marketing management concepts. By integrating field-based insights of 52 managers engaging in CEM with supplementary literature, this study provides an empirically and theoretically solid conceptualization. Specifically, it introduces CEM as a higher-order resource of cultural mindsets toward customer experiences (CEs), strategic directions for designing CEs, and firm capabilities for continually renewing CEs, with the goals of achieving and sustaining long-term customer loyalty. We disclose a typology of four distinct CEM patterns, with firm size and exchange continuity delineating the pertinent contingency factors of this generalized understanding. Finally, we discuss the findings in relation to recent theoretical research, proposing that CEM can comprehensively systemize and serve the implementation of an evolving marketing concept.

T1  - Representing Crowd Knowledge: Guidelines for Conceptual Modeling of User-generated Content
AN  - 1897778243
AB  - Organizations' increasing reliance on externally produced information, such as online user-generated content (UGC) and crowdsourcing, challenges common assumptions about conceptual modeling in information systems (IS) development. We demonstrate UGC's societal importance, analyze its distinguishing characteristics, identify specific conceptual modeling challenges in this setting, evaluate traditional and recently proposed approaches to modeling UGC, propose a set of conceptual modeling guidelines for developing IS that harness structured UGC, and demonstrate how to implement and evaluate the proposed guidelines using a case of development of a real crowdsourcing (citizen science) IS. We conclude by considering implications for conceptual modeling research and practice.

T1  - The role of distances in requirements communication: a case study
AN  - 1867927870
AB  - Requirements communication plays a vital role in development projects in coordinating the customers, the business roles and the software engineers. Communication gaps represent a significant source of project failures and overruns. For example, misunderstood or uncommunicated requirements can lead to software that does not meet the customers' requirements, and subsequent low number of sales or additional cost required to redo the implementation. We propose that requirements engineering (RE) distance measures are useful for locating gaps in requirements communication and for improving on development practice. In this paper, we present a case study of one software development project to evaluate this proposition. Thirteen RE distances were measured including geographical and cognitive distances between project members, and semantic distances between requirements and testing artefacts. The findings confirm that RE distances impact requirements communication and project coordination. Furthermore, the concept of distances was found to enable constructive group reflection on communication gaps and improvements to development practices. The insights reported in this paper can provide practitioners with an increased awareness of distances and their impact. Furthermore, the results provide a stepping stone for further research into RE distances and methods for improving on software development processes and practices.

T1  - Digital Threat and Vulnerability Management: The SVIDT Method
AN  - 1899850324
AB  - The Digital Revolution is inducing major threats to many types of human systems. We present the SVIDT method (a Strengths, Vulnerability, and Intervention Assessment related to Digital Threats) for managing the vulnerabilities of human systems with respect to digital threats and changes. The method first performs a multilevel system-actor analysis for assessing vulnerabilities and strengths with respect to digital threats. Then, the method identifies threat scenarios that may become real. By constructing, evaluating, and launching interventions against all identified digital threats and their critical negative outcomes, the resilience of a specific human system can be improved. The evaluation of interventions is done when strengthening the adaptive capacity, i.e., a system’s capability to cope with negative outcomes that may take place in the future. The SVIDT method is embedded in the framework of coupled human-environment systems, the theory of risk and vulnerability assessment, types of adaptation (assimilation vs. accommodation), and a comprehensive sustainability evaluation. The SVIDT method is exemplarily applied to an enterprise (i.e., a Swiss casino) for which online gaming has become an essential digital-business field. The discussion reflects on the specifics of digital threats and discusses both the potential benefits and limitations of the SVIDT method.

T1  - The role of customer brand engagement in social media: conceptualisation, measurement, antecedents and outcomes
AN  - 1858077091
AB  - Customer Brand Engagement (CBE) is an important, timely concept, particularly for service brands using interactive social media channels. This research involved elucidation of the main characteristics of CBE, development and evaluation of a social media adapted CBE measurement scale and hypothesis testing to position CBE in social media among other relationship concepts. We identified CBE as a unique concept using a repertory grid, adapted a three-dimensional organisational behaviour scale and validated the scale using questionnaire and panel data. The scale is reliable for the measurement of CBE in interactive social media contexts, incorporating physical, emotional and cognitive psychological engagement states, as demonstrated with exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. We found significant effects of customer participation and brand involvement on CBE, and of CBE on brand loyalty through brand experience and satisfaction. This paper demonstrates the complexity (multidimensionality) of CBE and shows how it can be measured appropriately in interactive contexts.

T1  - Generating and exploiting customer insights from social media data
AN  - 1811162417
AB  - Previous research has emphasized the virtues of customer insights as a key source of competitive advantage. The rise of customers' social media use allows firms to collect customer data in an ever-increasing volume and variety. However, to date, little is known about the capabilities required of firms to turn social media data into valuable customer insights and exploit these insights to create added value for customers. Based on the dynamic capabilities perspective, in particular the concept of absorptive capacity (ACAP), the authors conducted multiple case studies of seven mid-sized and large B2C firms in Switzerland and Germany. The results provide an in-depth analysis of the underlying processes of ACAP as well as contingent factors - that is, physical, human and organizational resources that underpin the firms' ACAP.

T1  - Value co-creation: concept and measurement
AN  - 1779347742
AB  - The surge in academic and practical interest in the topic of value co-creation (VCC) highlights an equivocal understanding of its conceptual boundaries and empirical constituents. Our search of the diverse scholarly literature on VCC identified 149 papers, from which we extract the two primary conceptual VCC dimensions of co-production and value-in-use. Though the combination of these two distinct dimensions is theoretically necessary to describe VCC, 79% of the studies in our dataset consider only one or the other. Such underlying theoretical ambiguity may explain conflicting results in earlier studies and motivates our effort to offer four contributions to the literature. First, we conduct a rigorous review, integrating existing work to expose the theoretical core of VCC. Second, we utilize the results from our review to isolate the two main theoretical dimensions of VCC and expose the three conceptual elements which underlie each dimension. Third, we apply our theoretical findings to derive empirical measurement constructs for each dimension. Fourth, we refine, analyze, and test the resulting measurement index in an investigation into consumer satisfaction.

This work describes the evaluation of problems students have with Moodle2 -- an e-learning platform. Special focus lies on international students who could overcome language problems by using learning technology. This includes investigation of how the definition ofproblem generating factors can be evaluated by using the evaluation tool CoALa based on the research method Repertory Grid. An evaluation was done with international students, at Technische Universität Ilmenau, Germany, in November 2015, in order to evaluate advantages and barriers of Moodle2. Results show that the motivation to use Moodle2 may be rather extrinsic provided by the professor and motivational support is less provided by the e-learning platform itself.

T1  - Comparing approaches to elicit brand attributes both face-to-face and online: The Journal of the Market Research Society
AN  - 1762009981
AB  - Brand attributes play an important role in tracking customer-based brand equity. Therefore researchers need an effective approach for eliciting attributes. This paper has two aims: to determine which of four different techniques elicit(s) better results; and to test if online data collection is a viable alternative to face-to-face collection. The techniques compared are: Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET), Free Elicitation (FE), Repertory Grid (RG) and Projective Elicitation (PE). These approaches are compared on the number and variety of attributes generated, as well as respondent evaluation. FE is the best-performing technique in a face-to-face context, generating the most attributes, evaluated positively by respondents and providing a typical distribution of attribute types. We also provide evidence that online is a viable data collection method for attribute elicitation studies, except ZMET due to respondent drop-out. Online we recommend a combination of FE and PE to obtain a range and variety of responses.

AB  - Based on cross-disciplinary approaches to Embodied Conversational Agents, evaluation methods for such human-computer interfaces are structured and presented. An introductory systematisation of evaluation topics from a conversational perspective is followed by an explanation of social-psychological phenomena studied in interaction with Embodied Conversational Agents, and how these can be used for evaluation purposes. Major evaluation concepts and appropriate assessment instruments – established and new ones – are presented, including questionnaires, annotations and log-files. An exemplary evaluation and guidelines provide hands-on information on planning and preparing such endeavours.

T1  - Women and international assignments
AN  - 2129541771
AB  - Purpose – Research on female expatriates has been substantially growing over the last decades and particularly in more recent years. Complementing previous thematic analyses of the literature, the purpose of this paper is to apply textual statistics and correspondence analysis to reveal the existing semantic structure of the field of research on female expatriates. Design/methodology/approach – Using correspondence analysis, the authors explored textual data from the abstracts of 151 identified journal articles published in English since 1975. The authors obtained a graphical representation showing the various developmental stages of research on female expatriates. Findings – The authors found that research follows a home-host country orientation and advances from an organizational focus toward individual-level studies. The authors identified various directions for future research and especially a strong need for more multilevel approaches to study men’s and women’s expatriate experiences and trajectories in various contexts. Research limitations/implications – Only articles with abstracts entered the analysis, which in turn was dependent on the content and quality of these abstracts. This limitation has been addressed by thoroughly reading each article considered. Originality/value – This review adopts an original method in research on (female) expatriates and more broadly management research. It enabled the authors to map out the development of key research themes over time. Based on this analysis, gaps in current research could be identified and clear directions for future research were formulated.

T1  - Search Interfaces for Mathematicians
AN  - 2084123471
AB  - Access to mathematical knowledge has changed dramatically in recent years, therefore changing mathematical search practices. Our aim with this study is to scrutinize professional mathematicians' search behavior. With this understanding we want to be able to reason why mathematicians use which tool for what search problem in what phase of the search process. To gain these insights we conducted 24 repertory grid interviews with mathematically inclined people (ranging from senior professional mathematicians to non-mathematicians). From the interview data we elicited patterns for the user group "mathematicians" that can be applied when understanding design issues or creating new designs for mathematical search interfaces.

T1  - Terrorism; Studies from University of Liverpool Provide New Data on Terrorism
AN  - 1497255998
AB  - The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the University of Liverpool, "As part of a larger study, three individuals convicted of Islamic-related terrorist violence in India were interviewed using a semi-structured life narrative procedure enhanced by a Repertory Grid (Kelly, 1955/1991). One was a senior leader of a terrorist group, one a subordinate, the third a person who planted a bomb without full knowledge of the larger design he was part of. Principal component analyses of these grids informed by comments from the life narratives were used to elaborate each man's conceptual system and how it related to his commitment to violence. Important differences among the three individuals' in their construct systems were found. This demonstrated that the forms of Jihadi commitment is embedded in the individual's personal construct system.

T1  - Deconstructing the value proposition of an innovation exemplar
AN  - 1507776911
AB  - Purpose - Research into the identification and development of value propositions has recently been identified as a key research priority by the Marketing Science Institute. The purpose of this article is to identify and develop a process for value proposition deconstruction that can help organizations transform their value propositions in order to gain an improvement in their competitive position. Design/methodology/approach - A case study of an exemplar organization in the health care sector is used to develop an approach for value proposition deconstruction. Using the business system concept as a theoretical framework, the key value-adding elements that comprise this organization's value proposition are identified. A leading financial services firm is used to demonstrate how this learning approach can be successfully applied in developing a new and innovative value proposition. Findings - Using the business system framework, a structured process for deconstructing value propositions is developed. This framework is extended to explicitly acknowledge the value-in-use that results from different encounters, to incorporate learning processes and to recognize its interactive and recursive nature. Practical implications - The authors provide practitioners with insight into how to formulate new or improved value propositions. Originality/value - This work addresses two important and previously unaddressed research questions: how can the process of deconstruction of an exemplar organization's value proposition provide a more comprehensive understanding of the elements that comprise a superior value offering; and how can this process be applied to other organizations seeking to improve their value proposition?

T1  - Construction by Interpersonal Context and Relationship to Psychological Outcomes
AN  - 1411667848
AB  - The repertory grid was used to elicit personal constructs with 10 elements, including three interpersonal self roles, in 33 participants (age M = 20.79, SD = 2.70). Each participant also rated a selection of supplied personality trait constructs and completed several psychological outcome measures. The distance between the self roles was associated with higher levels of anxiety for both personal and the supplied trait constructs, and was also related to greater cognitive complexity for personal constructs. The lack of statistical association between anxiety and cognitive complexity, however, suggested the distance relationships to each outcome are due to some other factor. Based on previous research findings, the overall pattern of results suggests that the grid distances between each interpersonal self is a due to the individual's behavioral flexibility or situational changeability. The findings demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between personal and supplied trait constructs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Influence of Analyst Communication in IS Projects
AN  - 1470087374
AB  - Information system (IS) researchers have long noted that IS analysts need to understand users' needs if they are to design better systems and improve project outcomes. While researchers agree that analyst communication activities are an important prerequisite for such an understanding, little is known about the nature of different communication behaviors IS analysts can undertake to learn about users' system needs and the impact of such behaviors on IS projects. To address this gap, this paper draws from the learning literature to articulate the information transmission activities IS analysts can undertake and the content of the information they can transmit when learning about users' organizational tasks and information needs. The influence of analyst communication activities on the generation of valid information regarding user needs, analyst learning, and IS project outcomes are then investigated via a case study of two IS projects. The analysis of the two cases suggests that analysts who encourage the use of concrete examples, testing, and validation, and who solicit feedback about users' business processes are likely to better understand users' tasks, and in turn design systems that better meet users' task needs than analysts who do not.

AB  - Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Erasmus University, "In this study, it was explored a refined one-to-one interview technique, check-all-that-apply (CATA) linked with a repertory grid method (RGM) (CATA/RGM) designed to measure consumer-relevant Kansei - psychological feelings and impressions for products - as applied to 12 commercial bottled tea products. For statistical analyses, 2 multivariate statistical methods for Kansei profiling were compared: CATA/RGM based-structured free choice profiling (FCP) and cued elicitation. Results showed that the CATA/RGM efficiently differentiated between products, and the product differentiation obtained from the 2 Kansei profiling techniques corresponded."

T1  - An Organizational Identity Approach to Strategic Groups
AN  - 1331076024
AB  - We argue that a firm forms three distinct relationships with strategic groups-identification, disidentification, and ambivalent identification. Firms can form any of these relationships with multiple strategic groups, and the set of these relationships comprises a firm's strategic group configuration (SGC). We propose that the nature of a firm's identity influences the characteristics of its SGC. We demonstrate the implications of our model by exploring how a firm's strategic group configuration affects its information-seeking behaviors. Finally, we describe how the SGC framework offers several key implications for this field of research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Unexpected findings included that the former combatants viewed themselves more favorably than did noncombatants. The findings are discussed in terms of individual and social construing processes, drawing on narratives and interview and focus group responses obtained from the participants in the larger investigation of which this study was part. Particular consideration is given to the role of forgiveness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Personal Construct System of a Runaway Adolescent: An Illustrative Case Study
AN  - 1151997503
AB  - Personal constructs of an 18-year-old adolescent were explored by the use of a repertory grid focusing on the domains of family, self, and world. Results indicated that the runaway adolescent construed his family in a negative and rejecting way, whereas important people outside the family were perceived in a more accepting and friendly manner. It was also found that although the young man construed himself in a positive manner, at the same time he perceived himself as aloof and distant from both family and nonfamily members. The findings indicate that a young adolescent's decision to run away from home and jump into the world of the unknown is the consequence of certain push factors in the home environment and pull factors in the external world. Results of the grid are discussed in light of key elements in construct space. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Governance of open content creation: A conceptualization and analysis of control and guiding mechanisms in the open content domain
AN  - 1052938012
AB  - The open content creation process has proven itself to be a powerful and influential way of developing text-based content, as demonstrated by the success of Wikipedia and related sites. Distributed individuals independently edit, revise, or refine content, thereby creating knowledge artifacts of considerable breadth and quality. Our study explores the mechanisms that control and guide the content creation process and develops an understanding of open content governance. The repertory grid method is employed to systematically capture the experiences of individuals involved in the open content creation process and to determine the relative importance of the diverse control and guiding mechanisms. Our findings illustrate the important control and guiding mechanisms and highlight the multifaceted nature of open content governance. A range of governance mechanisms is discussed with regard to the varied levels of formality, the different loci of authority, and the diverse interaction environments involved. Limitations and opportunities for future research are provided. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 915434863
AB  - To discover personal meanings and patterns of everyday food choices across different situations we used a qualitative approach in the form of repertory grid interviews. An analysis of the personal constructs elicited from a representative sample of 100 Swiss consumers revealed elaborated value systems. The food-related values can be summarised as: authenticity/naturalness, conviviality, health, quality/indulgence, convenience, and price. The salience of these values and their negatively evaluated counterparts differed for various social eating situations and product categories. Consumers' personal values also differed significantly from their perception of current trends in eating culture.

T1  - Analyzing Students' Technology Use Motivations: An Interpretive Structural Modeling Approach
AN  - 1459460717
AB  - Despite being more meaningful and accurate to consider student technology use motivations as a set of interactive needs and expectations, the possible underlying hierarchical relationships among motivations receive little attention. Drawn from Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach and from Means-End Chain (MEC) theory, this study investigates how student technology use motivations can be represented as a set of interrelated and hierarchically organized elements. A set of relevant data concerning students' technology use motivations was collected by the Repertory Grid Interview Technique (RGT) and analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. Eleven identified student technology use motivations were structured by adopting interpretive structure modeling (ISM) technique. By using Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) technique, eleven identified factors were further classified into three different types of variables: means, consequences, and ends. The findings of this study have significant theoretical and practical implications to both researchers and managers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Construing the Meaning of Authenticity in University Teaching: Comparing Explicit to Implicit Theories
AN  - 1030251993
AB  - Although recent literature on university teaching highlights "authenticity" as an important concept, the meaning of this complex notion remains elusive. Sternberg (1990) proposed that we gain deeper insight into phenomena that are assumed to be of profound meaning but remain insufficiently understood if, alongside explicit theories of experts, we also consider the implicit theories of nonspecialists. This repertory grid study explored with a sample of lecturers their personal conceptions of authenticity in teaching and how these compare to explicit theories developed by educationalists and philosophers. Implications for theory and professional development, as well as future directions for research, are offered.

T1  - Generational cohorts' expectations in the workplace: A study of New Zealanders: Journal of the Institue of Personnel Management Australia
AN  - 909471473
AB  - It has been suggested in the media and popular press that there are differences between the generational cohorts (Veterans, Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y) and that organisations need to manage people from each cohort differently. However, the evidence is largely anecdotal. This study investigates whether the popular characterisations of generational cohorts are valid, using qualitative and linear discriminant analysis. 164 participants completed a 69-item questionnaire developed from an independent sample of 64 repertory-grid interviews in which interviewees described their ideal job. More similarities than differences were found: only 8 of the 69 constructs provided a reasonable level of discrimination between generational cohorts. Our results challenge the popular depictions of generational cohorts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Towards a conceptualisation of quality in information technology projects
AN  - 871037748
AB  - Quality has been extensively studied in repetitive operations, but it remains under-researched in projects. The uncertainty and dynamics of projects challenge the principles of quality developed for repetitive operations, and call for project-tailored solutions. This article explores the attributes of quality in projects, based on interviews conducted within a large IT-services company. An adapted repertory grid was used to investigate the understanding of quality by comparing concrete examples of projects considered as high or low quality. Eight attributes of quality were identified, which indicate a tension between a mechanistic standpoint of quality, and the need to incorporate less tangible aspects. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Trading-up mass-market goods to luxury products: AMJ AMJ AMJ
AN  - 878893621
AB  - This paper addresses the current lack of consensus on what defines a luxury product. It demonstrates the adequacy of a consumer-oriented approach anchored in a list of product attributes. These attributes were identified from the literature and a study of 31 German millionaires with high spending on luxury goods. A combination of five research methodologies was employed including open interview, the repertory grid method (RGM), the preference differences technique, the critical incident technique and the projective technique. The findings suggest that consumers distinguish luxury products using six major characteristics: price, quality, aesthetics, rarity, extraordinariness, and symbolic meaning. The paper concludes with practical implications for luxury brand managers and for those who wish to trade up their mass-market goods. Suggestions for further research directions are also offered.

T1  - The Convergent Validity of Structural Measures of Differentiation Derived from Repertory Grids
AN  - 858632458
AB  - Within repertory grid research multiple measures of differentiation referring to the relative number of judgments have been in use to assess the structure of personal construct systems. Extant research reports correlations between some of the structural measures being studied. However, a comprehensive investigation documenting how the most commonly used measures of differentiation correlate does not exist, thus raising questions about the measures' convergent validity. In this study, we examine the convergent validity between percentage of variance explained by the first factor (PVAFF), intensity, cognitive complexity-simplicity, functionally independent construction (FIC), and number of factors. Our findings suggest significant correlations between the structural measures of differentiation, and a psychometric assessment yields an internally consistent one-factor solution. These results support the convergent validity of the five structural measures of differentiation. With the exception of cognitive complexity-simplicity, grid size is associated with the other four structural measures of differentiation.

T1  - Psychology; Studies from R.R.C. Mceachan and colleagues yield new information about psychology
AN  - 214833925
AB  - This paper uses an inductive approach to explore this issue. In Study 1, 25 repertory grid interviews and 3 focus groups encompassing lay public and health professionals identified 25 ways of describing health behaviours. These were refined into 11 key characteristics. In Study 2, 180 members of the general public rated 20 health behaviours on each of these characteristics. Principal components analysis indicated behaviours were perceived along three key dimensions: 'easy immediate pay-offs' versus 'effortful long-term pay-offs'; 'private unproblematic' versus 'public and problematic'; and 'important routines' versus 'unimportant one-offs'. Risk behaviours were clearly differentiated being perceived as 'easy immediate pay-offs' and 'public-problematic'.

T1  - The Operational Demand Evaluation Checklist (ODEC) of workload for railway signalling
AN  - 205287445
AB  - This paper is concerned with the interpretation and assessment of mental workload, and in particular assessment of the load imposed by the work system. It highlights a framework created to direct the development of workload assessment tools capable of assessing the dimensions most relevant to the population being studied, in our case railway signallers. A tool to capture the operational demands on the rail signaller was required to evaluate the load from the system they operated. This paper justifies the need for, and describes the development of, the Operational Demand Evaluation Checklist (ODEC), using techniques like repertory grid with active signallers. The practical experience of the development, evaluation, live use and validation of ODEC is discussed and the paper concludes by suggesting that the approach could be adopted to interpret the concept of workload in other work domains.

T1  - Mental Illness; Researchers from University of Wollongong detail new studies and findings in the area of mental illness
AN  - 194621958
AB  - Constructs related to recovery, as well as other recovery focused measures. Perceptions of one's ''ideal self'' represented more advanced recovery in contrast to perceptions of ''a person mentally unwell.'' Current perceptions of self were most similar to perceptions of ''usual self'' and least similar to ''a Person who is mentally unwell.'' Increased identification with one's ''ideal self'' reflected increased hopefulness in terms of recovery. The recovery repertory grid shows promise in clinical practice, in terms of exploring identity as a key variable within mental health recovery processes," wrote K. Buckleywalker and colleagues, University of Wollongong.

T1  - Understanding Consumer Attitudes Toward Food Technologies in Canada
AN  - 207677066
AB  - This article reports a study on consumer attitudes to 21 food and nonfood technologies in Canada. The study involves repertory grid interviews with 36 food consumers, the data from which are analyzed using generalized Procrustes analysis. Results highlight the role of perceived risk and perceived benefit in determining the acceptability of the technologies, with individual technologies lying along a continuum between the two. For technology as a whole and the 21 specific technologies, the perceived risk and perceived benefit constructs were the dominant determinants of consumer acceptability. While perceptions of perceived risk and perceived benefit differed between individual respondents, there were very limited consistent relations with a range of sociodemographic variables.

T1  - CONFLICT AND CO-PARENTING: THE CONSTRUCTS OF NONRESIDENT FATHERS
AN  - 233129897
AB  - Scots law constructs a co-parental role for nonresident fathers without clarifying how this should operate in practice. Personal Construct Theory (PCT) offers a useful approach to understanding such fathers' distinct and changing conceptions of their role. Findings are presented from a study of 17 nonresident Scottish fathers maintaining contact with nonresident children. Idiographic analysis of data from repertory grid interviews administered three times over the course of a year shows that participants perceive family situations in terms of paternal involvement, impact, emotion, or antagonism. Changes in construing following family events support the PCT understanding of hostility; implications for family services are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Competent Production Supervisors
AN  - 222399199
AB  - While the manufacturing sector is vanishing in most European and North American regions, northeast Italian firms have successfully contrasted global competition thanks to superior manufacturing capabilities grounded, among other things, on people's competencies. Applying nonparametric statistical analysis on data from 212 behavioral event and 44 repertory grid interviews, the research presented in this note investigates the nature of these competencies for production supervisors in northeast Italian firms. We identify four threshold and nine distinctive competencies and offer insights on the relationship between these competencies and northeast Italian firms' manufacturing capability. We also suggest how to use competency tools to design skill development policies in industrial clusters and implement effective human resource management practices in small and medium-sized enterprises.

AN  - 213158166
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a piece of empirical work that examines gender differences in how academics make sense of performance within university business schools in the UK. The research reported draws on data collected using a life history and repertory grid methodology with male and female interviewees from two university business schools. The findings are discussed in relation to how academics understand what is valued about their role and what they believe the organisation rewards and values when it comes to promotion. Gender differences are shown to exist in the ways women and men define the academic role and in what they think is important both to themselves and the institution. The paper presents original data on gender differences within a business school context.

AB  - In the field of information system engineering, information modeling method is a technique to capture user requirements and to understand system complexity. The importance of information modeling has been recognized by practitioners and researchers, but little has been explored to analyze the available information modeling methods or to evaluate them in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness. This research analyzes six information-modeling methods: use case diagram, rich picture diagram, entity-relationship diagram, Trochim's concept mapping, repertory grid, and causal mapping. These information-modeling methods are analyzed from a cognitive perspective in order to better understand their nature, the assumptions, and the important features associated. The research contributes to the understanding of the information modeling methods and their potential uses and values during IS development. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 196609038
AB  - The Republic of Ireland has been running the same basic brand proposition in its various marketing campaigns for some decades (Morgan, Pritchard and Pride, 2002). However, it is unclear whether the destination brand construct that has served Ireland's general tourism market so well can apply equally when attracting business tourism to Dublin, the nation's capital city. This research primarily applies repertory grid analysis and on-line focus groups to understand the brand of Dublin, the capital of Ireland, and explores the way the marketing of a national capital city for business tourism both influences, and is influenced by, the marketing of the nation itself.

T1  - Towards a theory of visitors' evaluation of historical districts as tourism destinations: Frameworks and methods*
AN  - 196327996
AB  - This study aims to illustrate the complex nature of visitors' evaluation of historical districts as tourism destinations and how this complex nature can be understood and investigated. The literature review suggested a theoretical framework based on relationships between visitors' mental states and a district's features. Personal interviews employing Repertory Grid Analysis and Laddering Analysis with use of photographs of a historical district in Takayama-shi, Japan were conducted with a sample of Japanese students. The results illustrate that these methods elucidate issues argued in past studies and may be effective in investigating visitors' evaluation of historical districts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Trust and technologies: Implications for organizational work practices
AN  - 206601958
AB  - In this paper, we empirically investigate the concept of trust across organizational work practices by examining three groups: within the team, between teams and when interacting with technology. This study adopts Repertory Grid methodology as an interview based technique to elicit important constructs of trust to engineering teams working in two organizations within the energy distribution industry. Thirteen key constructs of trust were identified using content analysis. Drawing on the understanding gained, this paper discusses the implications for theories on trust within teams working with technology across organizations and provides a grounded perspective that could be used as a basis for further research.

T1  - The Elaboration of Personal Construct Psychology
AN  - 205799055
AB  - More than half a century has passed since the publication of George Kelly's (1955/1991) The Psychology of Personal Constructs. This review considers the elaboration of personal construct psychology (PCP) during this time, both by Kelly and by others who developed his ideas. Advances to the theory have principally concerned implicative relationships between constructs, construing of the self, social relationships, emotions, links with other approaches, and supporting research. With regard to methods of assessment of construing, major developments have occurred in both repertory grid and nongrid techniques, such as laddering. The principal advances in the applications of PCP have been in the clinical, educational, and organizational fields, but have by no means been limited to these areas. It can be concluded that PCP has met Kelly's own design specifications for a useful theory and that PCP can perhaps anticipate at least another half-century of elaboration. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 1698435120
AB  - La théorie des incitations, rapprochée de la théorie de l'agence dans le champ comptable, comprend deux grandes dimensions, le vouloir agir et le pouvoir agir, mais cette dernière composante n'a été que très peu analysée. Les travaux de Paul Ricoeur permettent de montrer qu'en s'intéressant exclusivement aux incitations comme un correctif de la (mauvaise) volonté des agents, la théorie de l'agence nie la capacité d'agir de ceux-ci et risque ainsi de favoriser des dispositifs de gestion qui augmentent l'incapacité. Pour répondre au défi méthodologique posé par cette nouvelle perspective, nous présentons la théorie des construits personnels et la technique du repertory grid élaborées par George Kelly.

T1  - Modelling of risk management in health care facilities
AN  - 219656840
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the use of neural networks in healthcare facilities risk management. The data used to develop the input to the national health service facilities risk exposure system was solicited from 60 healthcare managers. Risk exposure system has been developed using the risk knowledge that was articulated from experienced healthcare operators through postal questionnaires and repertory grid interviews. This knowledge was then transformed and represented in Trajan 4.0, an expert system shell that uses artificial neural networks as its modeling technique. It provides healthcare facilities operators an avenue to evaluate their own risk management method (point score system) based on their own healthcare business knowledge/judgment and corporate objectives for various facilities management service operations.

AN  - 227693615
AB  - This article offers a conceptual framework for classifying attributes of offerings in a business-marketing context. Typologies on the nature of product-related attributes and classification of industrial products are synthesized for viewing levels of product meaning. Repertory grid procedures first developed in clinical psychology and recently adapted for use in business settings are presented as an approach for eliciting salient/determinant attributes. Enhanced effectiveness of the classic industrial selling process is demonstrated along with implications for managing the sales force. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The job of training and learning professionals requires good management of resources -- time and money -- and a good feel for the way the organization works. Many different players are responsible for driving and delivering people development. It is the manager's credibility and their relationship with these players -- particularly senior management -- that determine their success. No-one was ever sacked because they did not undertake a repertory grid. However, because the underlying need is evident, it does not necessarily mean that the training solution is obvious.

T1  - Prompting conceptual understanding with computer-mediated peer discourse and knowledge acquisition techniques
AN  - 229771824
AB  - Numerous computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools have been designed to facilitate group discourses on the Web. However, previous studies noted that participants did not value online conferencing as a method for conducting in-depth discussions, and instead considered this method as merely scratching the surface of the issues involved. Therefore, the teachers must moderate the online discourse to add value to the success of CMC. This study presents a methodology that uses knowledge acquisition techniques during online discourses to increase student conceptual understanding and evaluation skills. The methodology explains the conceptual frameworks of individuals and the conceptual relationships between student peers. Active database triggers then are applied to automatically monitor the conceptual relationships and to moderate online discourses between student peers. Student reactions demonstrated that discourses mediated by the repertory grid analysis technique helped group members not only promote common conceptual understandings but also to approach the level of conceptual understanding of the teacher.

T1  - Preception of bread: A comparison of consumers and trained assessors
AN  - 194415167
AB  - The main objective of this study was to investigate consumers' perception of bread and to compare the used vocabulary with descriptive attributes used by a trained panel. Perceived appropriateness of breads were also studied and related to the sensory perception. Seven different types of bread were chosen for the study. The breads were presented to 30 consumers, and the repertory grid method was used to obtain information about sensory perception and appropriateness of use. The breads were also presented to a trained sensory panel performing sensory profiling. Multivariate analyses of the data showed that the latent structure in consumers' perception of a selection of breads was similar to the latent structure in a trained panel's perception of the same breads. For verbal description of the texture, the 2 panels used many identical words. Moreover, multivariate analyses revealed the relationship between consumers' perception of the breads and the appropriateness of use. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Uncovering your customer's hidden needs
AN  - 224666707
AB  - The way companies 'listen' to their customers is changing as managers realise end users are often unable to articulate their needs and focus groups seldom lead to breakthrough product ideas. A vanguard of product developers has addressed the issue of hidden needs - needs which customers themselves do not always recognise - and some companies are using novel ways to capture them. The questionnaire has several drawbacks. The traditional fallback after questionnaires is the focus group. Repertory grid analysis was developed by psychologists to understand how individuals think and to uncover their cognitive 'maps', a technique that is ideal for developing new product ideas. Observation is another very effective hidden needs analysis technique. Another technique is the contextual interview.

T1  - The complexity of consumers' cognitive structures and its relevance to consumer behavior
AN  - 196326818
AB  - Consumers make numerous product decisions every day. This decision-making process depends on the information processing style employed. A key factor here is the complexity of a consumer's cognitive structures (i.e., the sophistication of the structures used to organize information). Although this construct, cognitive complexity, holds much promise for consumer behavior, several questions remain to be answered and were addressed by the present research. First, the results of the present research indicate that the Repertory Grid, developed in social interaction contexts, is a reliable instrument for measuring cognitive complexity in the consumer behavior domain. Second, the results further suggest the presence of a generalizable - as well as a context-specific - component of cognitive complexity. The generalizable component of cognitive complexity indicates that these knowledge structures are transferable across related product categories. As such, cognitive complexity is likely to impact consumer processing of product information and advertising messages. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 756930069
AB  - This study extended current research linking spirituality to health by investigating the relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic spirituality and cardiovascular risk factors. Participants included 111 healthy males and females, ages 28 to 63. Measurements consisted of the Lifestyle Assessment Questionnaire (LAQ), a version of Kelly's Repertory Grid, hematological analysis, and blood pressure. A greater sense of spirituality was associated with lower cholesterol risk ratios (total cholesterol/HDL) and triglyceride levels. In addition, the structural or organizational characteristics of intrinsic spirituality were associated with several other hematological measures. Further research will help clarify the association between mechanisms underlying spirituality and health, including susceptibility to cardiovascular disorders.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The role and marketing implications of destination images on tourist behavior: The case of northern Portugal
AN  - 305439508
AB  - The present research work studies the concept, assessment, structure and role of destination image in the context of tourism in rural areas. The perspective is one of marketing, specifically consumer behavior, focusing on tourists' perceptions and evaluations made of the visited rural areas in North Portugal.    A literature review helps understand the particularity of tourism , especially rural tourism, and reflects on the corresponding nature of destination marketing. Also the construct  image is discussed. This is based on a literature review of diverse scientific approaches. The discussion of destination image in tourism and leisure research includes definitions, image assessment, image structure and formation, impacts of image on tourist behavior and its role in destination marketing.    Based on this background discussion, a series of hypotheses are advanced. These are tested in the empirical part of the thesis using data obtained from a undertaken in North Portugal. The survey yielded 2280 valid responses, which contained data on socio-demographics, travel behavior, motivations, destination perceptions, evaluations and probable future travel behavior.    In addition to describing the content of destination image, its structure is analyzed, with affective, cognitive, imagery and holistic components considered as image elements. Affective and cognitive components are identified via  Principal Components Analysis. Relationships between components are presented in a path-analytical model ranging from cognitive over affective towards holistic destination image. Destination-self-congruity is analyzed as an affective component of destination image as well as the moderating role of psycho-graphic traveler type.    A series of tourist, travel-context and destination-specific variables are further analyzed as eventual (co-)determinants of these destination images. For this purpose, non-parametric tests are undertaken, considering simultaneously first-order interaction. An approximate rank order of importance is established and also single effects of independent variables on particular image dimensions are discussed.    Finally, the relationship between destination image and probable future travel behavior is analyzed and a positive correlation confirmed, particularly in the context of recommendation of the destination.    From these results, which are compared to those obtained in other destination image studies, a series of implications on destination marketing are suggested, as well as recommendations for future destination image research advanced.

T1  - Perceived applicant fit: Distinguishing between recruiters' perceptions of person-job and person-organization fit
AN  - 220143471
AB  - There were 2 studies conducted to assess whether recruiters form distinguishable perceptions of applicant person-job (P-J) and person-organization (P-O) fit. The first study used repertory grid methodology with actual recruiters and mock applicants to demonstrate that knowledge, skills, and abilities are relied on more frequently to assess P-J fit, and values and personality traits more often to assess P-O fit. Study 2, which involved actual recruiters making decisions on applicants in a field setting, supported P-J and P-O fit perceptions as 2 discernable factors. Study 2 also found that both types of perceived fit offer unique prediction of hiring recommendations. Taken together, these results present compelling evidence that recruiters discriminate between applicants' P-J and P-O fit during early interviews.

T1  - A Study of the Perceptions of the Labour Market by Human Resource Managers in the UK Hotel Industry: A Cognitive Approach
AN  - 1972081260
AB  - It is reasonable to assume that if the labour market is the dominant force in labour management then the significance of the role of the human resource manager lies in the position it holds at the intersection between the external and the internal market, with recruitment as the joining process. This paper describes a qualitative investigation of hotel human resource managers' perceptions of their labour market environment using the process of recruitment as a vehicle to explore cognitive processes. A cognitive task analysis was completed which utilised four interview methods: task diagram; knowledge audit; simulation interview; and repertory grid. The findings show that the HR managers conform to the appellation of 'expert' in that they would use few and simple rules in making decisions. They also assume that the labour market will always provide and that perceptions of what goes on inside the organisation are quite separate. In other words there is both an industry and in organisational perspective at work.

T1  - Inclusion, exclusion and ambiguity: The role of organisational culture
AN  - 214810388
AB  - This study describes case studies of 3 organizations, exploring the role of organizational culture as a framework for the inclusion and exclusion of actual and potential organizational members. To explore common understandings of culture, methods included: 1. repertory grid, 2. group discussions, 3. documentary evidence, 4. discussion with informants, and 5. observation and reflection by the author. Both the culture-as-variable and culture-as-metaphor perspectives are used respectively to analyze and interpret the data. A number of processes were found significant in the promotion or otherwise of diversity. Significant symbols in each organization are explored, and theoretical and practical implications are discussed in relation to managing diversity.

T1  - PE teachers teach the way they were taught: asset or handicap?
AN  - 214330614
AB  - The repertory grid shows how closely number patterns for effective and ineffective teachers are related. In conversation, student teachers are invited to describe similarities and differences between these teachers from a variety of different teaching/coaching contexts. From over seventy such interviews currently conducted, the majority of responses from PE student teachers have focused on effective coaches from their past-coaches who were instrumental in their success as athletes. Occasionally, PE teachers or other teachers from student teachers' pasts come up as model teachers. It is these teachers, rather than the coaches, that offer the framework to understand the principles and concepts of effective teaching in PE. The coaches, though inspirational in a particular sport, rarely offer the strategies for teaching that transfer into effective PE teaching.

T1  - A commentary by Chinese hotel workers on the value of vocational education
AN  - 215392374
AB  - The open-door policy started by the late Deng Xiao Ping has not only been maintained since his death but under the new Chinese leadership it has been encouraged even further. Because of this China has seen an unprecedented number of tourist arrivals which in turn has led to an explosion in the construction of hotels. However, due to poor vocational educational facilities and staff for hospitality subjects there is a dearth of qualified hotel operatives. A study examines Chinese hotel employees' perceptions of various elements of vocational education associated with the Chinese hotel industry. This was done by asking staff to rank their feelings on a bipolar scale and the results examined using Kelly's Repertory Grid principal components analysis.

AN  - 214802978
AB  - Starting from the viewpoint that career is a gender concept, the author suggests that organizational culture is a key determinant in relation to career paths, fostering success for men, and difficulty for women. Four case study organizations were investigated using repertory grid interviews with men and women managers, group discussions, and documentary evidence. In each case the organizational background, and traditional and current career paths are described, with comments on the extend to which these could be negotiated by women. Respondents outlined what is valued in managers in terms of characteristics and behavior in their respective organizations. All these aspects are linked to the key assumptions underlying each organizational culture. In 3 out of the 4 organizations women faced serious difficulties. Only in NHS Trust with a female chief executive was there close congruity between culture and style, and career paths open to all.

T1  - How Tutors Model Students: A Study of Personal Constructs in Adaptive Tutoring
AN  - 1986936326
AB  - Studies of tutoring are producing rich descriptions of tutorial dialogue but have not                identified constructs that tutors use to classify and discriminate among students for                the purpose of adapting tutoring to student differences. This study investigated five                experienced tutors' personal constructs about students tutored over a significant                period of time. Several tutoring settings and domains were represented. Constructs                used by tutors to discriminate among tutees were identified with repertory grid                interviews and interpreted with the aid of cluster analysis. All tutors judged and                classified students in terms of two underlying dimensions that were similarly                defined, though not exactly alike, across tutors: motivation and intellectual                ability. Tutors' personal constructs and tutorial decisions informed by those                constructs are reported, and implications for programming computer-based tutors are                discussed.

   While there is no "correct" map, analysing the map produced by each individual will give an expert a good idea of what the level of understanding each individual has on that particular topic, she says. Dr Stewart says the software is based on a technique called repertory grid interview, initially developed by an American engineer called George Kelly in 1930.

T1  - Cognitive maps in the analysis of personal change during work role transition
AN  - 229485014; 01204592
AB  - The way in which personal construct psychology and repertory grids can be used to produce cognitive maps is illustrated, and psychological adjustment during the transition from college to employment is analyzed.  Cognitive maps are based on the principal component analysis of repertory grid data and provide a visual representation of the way in which the subjects see themselves in relation to other people and in relation to their construct.  The cognitive maps produced by 2 graduates shortly after entry in employment and 6 months later are analyzed and compared in order to identify trends of personal change.  The case studies show that the analysis of the cognitive maps provides some valuable insights into the way in which graduates change their construction of themselves and of their work environment during the period of transition.

T1  - The use of norms in the evaluation of the exchange process: The consumer level
AN  - 304248632
AB  - The disciplines of economics and marketing have suggested that consumers derive satisfaction in exchange transactions from both the attributes of the products exchanged and the stores in which exchange takes place. This satisfaction is based on a comparison of the performance of these relatively objective attributes and a standard--the consumer's expectations of these attributes.    Recently, the marketing literature has suggested that an additional source of exchange-related satisfaction may arise from the actual process of exchange itself. Before a thorough understanding of this source of satisfaction can occur, we must gain a better knowledge of both the "attributes" of an exchange process and the standards of comparison used in its evaluation.    This dissertation proposes that consumers evaluate exchange processes against a set of norms which serve as standards for the behaviors involved. To explore this proposition, a two stage research plan was developed with the objectives of identifying the operant norms in consumer-retailer exchange processes and assessing their efficacy in satisfaction judgments of the exchange process.    The first stage was a qualitative research effort directed towards identifying the behaviors and norms involved in the exchange process. Qualitative analysis indicated that consumers utilize a set of seven exchange related norms in consumer-retailer exchange: appreciative behaviors, product/service knowledge, flexibility, respect for time, role diligence, contra-opportunism, and stand behind good products. Further, the satisfaction derived from the process appeared to be primarily related to the magnitude of the behaviors involved.    The second stage involved a quantitative assessment of the existence and impact of these seven norms in exchange related satisfaction judgments, building upon the findings of the qualitative stage. The results provided empirical support for a direct relationship between the magnitudes of behaviors related to a particular norm and the utility or satisfaction derived from those behaviors.    Support was also provided for the existence, differences between, and the shape of the return potential curves for each of the seven norm categories proposed in the initial phase of the study. The study identifies several substantive implications for the application and study of exchange-related satisfaction.

T1  - Developing a lay model of managerial effectiveness: A social constructionist perspective
AN  - 194217103; 01083636
AB  - A study uses repertory grid interviews and a follow-up questionnaire study to develop a "lay" theory of managerial effectiveness in a large New Zealand public sector organization.  The lay theory is presented as a model with 17 scales and 2 factors descriptive of effective and ineffective managers in the organization.  The 2 factors indicate that effective and ineffective managers in the department are differentiated in terms of their conceptual, and interpersonal abilities.  The effectiveness model shows strong similarity to models of effective management which have emerged in research outside New Zealand.  This similarity is of particular interest given the context-specific nature of the study.

AB  - An analysis identifies the dimensions of a higher customer contact food and beverage operative's job as perceived by managers, supervisors, and operatives and examines within-source and between-source differences in these perceptions.  The analysis uses 2 instruments, the repertory grid and the work profiling system.  It shows a number of distinct dimensions that are defined in terms of the worker behaviors necessary for the job tasks to be performed.  Managers/supervisors and operatives generally agree on a number of dimensions.  The analysis discusses variations occurring both with and between groups as well as implications for the choice of sources of job analysis data and the use of job analysis in a personnel selection and training context.

T1  - Clumping data in 2-way tables: A user-orientated perspective
AN  - 231359962; 00821816
AB  - Following a critique of existing algorithms, an algorithm is presented which will reorganize a 2-way data table to bring like rows together, and like columns together.  Extensions of the method are described, and justified, to accommodate distances measured in modular arithmetic, and with bipolar columns/rows, as in repertory grid analysis.  One value of the algorithms is that the user can see relationships in the tables without the data in the cells themselves ever having been transformed.  Thus, users will continue to feel they own their data.

T1  - Decision making in health service managers
AN  - 212085009; 00807396
AB  - Although the literature on managerial decision making typically espouses rationality, this rarely occurs.  Managers form a personal and simplified model of the real situation, incorporating personal and environmental factors, to facilitate their decision making.  A study used a repertory grid to explore the decision making model of 16 National Health Service managers and investigate what factors were important to them when considering strategic decisions.  Results indicated the complex and idiosyncratic nature of managerial decision making, vindicating the view that to understand decision making in any detail requires knowledge of the individual's model.  Rationality did not emerge as the driving force underlying the managers' decision making behavior.  For many managers, emotional items seemed to exert a significant influence on their decision making.  A link between patterns of construing and stress was hypothesized.  Managers whose construing was simpler, contained contradictions, or was more emotional in content reported experiencing more stress.

T1  - The Role of Fragrances in Product Development: Turning Images into Fragrances
AN  - 196319738; 00628116
AB  - The sensory properties of products are particularly important in the area of fine fragrances.  In an investigation, 10 assessors discussed some 19 fragrances, 19 essential oils, and 8 relevant chemical stimuli over a number of sessions.  Using group discussion, repertory grid, direct mapping, and simple profiling approaches, the assessors derived a list of 14 defined descriptors.  Fragrance descriptions and characteristics were grouped and reduced to a list which was used to obtain consumer reactions to actual fragrances assessed blind.  Under controlled evaluation conditions, 23 consumers tested 16 fragrances.  The sensory analysis and the subsequent linking of this to the image data showed that fragrant formulations can be identified in a consistent way using trained assessors and that this descriptive information can give good guidance to the product developer about what type of fragrance will suit a particular market position or the tastes of a particular consumer segment.

AN  - 231388133; 00610102
AB  - The Tender Enquiry Evaluation System (TEES) was developed as a support tool for a large electromechanical engineering company.  The system was developed to assist in tender enquiry evaluation and the bid versus no bid decision.  It was developed using repertory grid techniques based on the expertise of 2 senior managers.  The importance of the system's validation is stressed, and an appropriate formal validation framework is developed.  The results from the validation study suggest that the system provides an appropriate model of the organization's consensual business perspective regarding the bid versus no bid decision.  Furthermore, the study drew attention to some dissenting views among the organization's senior management that the managers believed to be helpful in clarifying their understanding of the issues affecting the bid versus no bid decision.

AB  - A model of effective set advising is researched from a literature review and repertory grid interviews with set advisers and is then tested against experience.  The 4 key dimensions that need to be managed to be able to deal effectively with a set are: 1.  the content dimension, which requires interpersonal skills and project diagnosis, planning, and management, 2.  the process dimension, by which the set adviser communicates and transfers action learning, the nature of team and group dynamics, and the basic group processes, 3.  the human feelings dimension, including how feelings are dealt with, put into a frame of reference, revealed, and acted upon, and 4.  the administration dimension, which involves ensuring that the logistics are in place.  Total contingency theories are challenged.  Behavioral and conceptual tools are developed by which advisers can be coached and developed over the dynamic life cycle of the set.

T1  - Construing of self and others at work in the early years of corporate careers: Summary
AN  - 228760975
AB  - Research has examined personal change and stability in early adulthood but generally with standardized scales and without inviting explicit comparison of self with other people. The present work uses the repertory grid method to examine how graduates construe themselves and others during early career. Ninety-four graduate entrants to a multinational corporation with zero to four years' tenure completed repertory grids on two occasions one year apart. Results shed much light on the graduates' concepts of self relative to others in their work setting, and how these change over time. The graduates generally had fairly positive self concepts, though these did not become more positive with tenure. Most saw themselves much as they thought others saw them. Change in concepts of self varied greatly between graduates, as did the constructs on which those concepts were described. The results cast further doubt on whether organizational socialization affects people in uniform ways.

T1  - Knowledge Bases: Integration, Verification, and Partitioning
AN  - 204166494; 00466628
AB  - A literature review is presented of 3 aspects of knowledge base design: 1.  knowledge integration, 2.  knowledge verification, and 3.  knowledge-base partitioning.  The key approaches to combining multiple expertise include: 1.  metaknowledge, 2.  set theoretic, 3.  consensus theory, 4.  repertory grid analysis, 5.  cluster analysis, and 6.  decision theory.  Combining expertise improves poor individual performance but degrades good individual performance.  This means that it is preferable to construct expert systems using consensus when the domain knowledge does not exists in a state of high conflict.  Verification techniques include: 1.  knowledge acquisition-based verification, 2.  graph-based verification, 3.  confidence-value verification, and 4.  iterative verification.  Most verification techniques can be classified as either consistency checkers or completeness checkers.  Information-theoretic approaches and cluster analysis approaches are among the knowlege-base partitioning methods.

T1  - Exploring the Meaning of Work and Nonwork
AN  - 224870755; 00450278
AB  - A study explored the relationship between work and nonwork activities for a group of employed professional and skilled tradespeople in New Zealand.  A preliminary sample of 40 subjects were used to to develop a 12-element repertory grid that was included in the questionnaires mailed to accountants, dentists, lawyers, primary school teachers, and plumbers.  Eighty-one usable responses were obtained.  The results confirmed previous research with the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic features of paid employment and the importance of a 3rd factor related to stress, time constraints, and the lack of free choice.  The results reaffirmed that job satisfaction is associated with the chance to use abilities and skills and with recognition for work well done.  More surprising was the clear distinction that these subjects made between the work and nonwork aspects of their lives and the perceived differences between their paid employment activities and nonwork activities, with little evidence of generalization between them.

T1  - Beyond Focus Groups: A Thrift's Guide to Market Research
AN  - 204607160; 00369249; 00130408
AB  - Market research has become increasingly important for thrifts in today's competitive environment.  Market research helps assess the potential market for a proposed technology or define the factors that influence consumer behavior.  There are several research methods available to augment the traditional focus groups and telephone surveys.  For example, individual, in-depth interviews can overcome the problems of focus group research aimed at busy, affluent customers.  A more cost-effective alternative are Teledepth interviews, conducted by telephone, which can cover a wider and more diverse geographic area.  If the "group effect" is needed, a Telegroup can be used.  These are focus groups conducted by teleconferencing.  The Knowledge/Attitudes/Practices study combines quantitative and qualitative research to examine an individual's assumptions and behavior.  The Kelly Repertory Grid helps determine exactly which dimensions consumers use to evaluate and make purchasing decisions.  Finally, segmentation analysis can help thrifts target the subcategories in an overall financial market.

T1  - A Behavioural Analysis of Demand Elasticities
AN  - 220674107; 00344017
AB  - Based on ideas from personal construct psychology, it is proposed that people feel attached or strongly desire to become attached to specific consumption pathways because they assess that doing otherwise would entail implications of a predominately negative kind with respect to their abilities to understand the complex and uncertain world around them.  Information-processing problems may cause consumers to be unable to compute the overall implications of alternative strategies when market conditions alter.  Therefore, they may use simplifying decision methods that may conflict with the principle of substitution.  The research program of personal construct psychology includes a set of research techniques for revealing ways in which individuals view the world, and 3 of these techniques are: 1.  repertory grid, 2.  construct laddering, and 3.  Hinkle's (1965) implication grid.  These 3 tools show the implications to the consumer of choosing one of the action schemes over the others.

AB  - PA Consultants (London) has developed the criterion-referenced interview, which can provide structure to employment interviews because it is based on detailed analysis of the job.  Focal points of the analysis include: 1.  tasks associated with the job, 2.  personal characteristics, and 3.  the organization's culture.  Two approaches can assist supervisors in moving from general impressions to specific professional and personal qualities in their interviewing questions -- Kelley's Repertory Grid and Flanagan's Critical Incident.  A panel of supervisors and managers should use a list of observable behaviors to rank those behaviors according to: 1.  how important each is to reaching and maintaining a superior level of performance, and 2.  how frequently each one is required in a typical time period.  Having the job criteria clearly in mind is the key to using the criterion-referenced interview.

T1  - A Measure of the Integrative Complexity of Personal Constructs
AN  - 848853288
AB  - A repertory grid measure of the integrative complexity of personal constructs is described. The grid is proposed as a measure of a subject's use of comprehensive abstract constructs to integrate and direct the sampling of characteristics used in forming impressions of people. The grid method is based on principles described by Piaget as characterizing the stage of formal operations. At the stage of formal operations, the child uses abstract constructions of what is possible to direct the exploration of what is available to experience. The use of such abstract organizing constructs is referred to here as "integrative complexity." Grid scores of integrative complexity were found to match simulations of the progressive integration versus fragmentation of constructions. The grid scores were also found to correlate with Crockett's measure of level of organization in impression formation. The results support the credibility of the coordinate grid measure of integrative complexity

T1  - Using Repertory Grids for Problem Construction
AN  - 231252923; 00258966
AB  - Repertory grid theory (Kelly, 1955) was originally developed as a practical means of mapping an individual's perceptions of reality.  Recently, repertory grids have gained the attention of operations researchers as a tool for analyzing large, ill-defined decision problems.  Grid theory is discussed, and grid construction in application to a simple decision problem involving a single individual, along with the use of rating scales to measure preferences for decision alternatives, is demonstrated.  Application of grid theory and techniques is then extended to operations research problems, and alternative methods of problem construction, including cognitive mapping, are examined.  It is concluded that grids offer a coherent approach to problem construction in operations research, but are not necessarily preferable to other methods of problem analysis.

AN  - 204974710; SFLNSPJHX1299JHGW598000006
AB  - The sex-role stereotypes held by heterosexual and homosexual men were examined by comparing their Repertory Grid scores. It was found that homosexual men held less rigid sex-role stereotypes than heterosexuals. Degree of opposite-sex identification was marginally greater in homosexuals, but neither group showed strong masculine or feminine stereotypic identification. Homosexual men perceived themselves as psychologically more distant from their fathers than did their heterosexual counterparts; this was probably an effect of homosexuality rather than a cause.

T1  - Toward a Cognitive Methodology of Organizational Assessment
AN  - 236285213; 00135729
AB  - An objective method for describing an organization in terms of its members' subjective, cognitive structures is presented.  The method is an adaptation of the Kelly Repertory Grid.  It produces a description of an organization's cognitive infrastructure.  Practitioners will find the method useful for most kinds of organizational research.  However, it is particularly suitable for the study of organizations with novel organizational structures: those composed of independent teams or other innovative forms of organizational structuring.  People's behavior in organizations is best understood in terms of their mental sets-conceptual frameworks-rather than in terms of needs or personality traits.  Major changes in cognitive structure are the result of a basic shift of constructs about natural phenomena.  Considering the infinite possibilities for cognitive structure, organizational assessment is more a matter of ideographic analysis than of measurement.  The study of organizations should be a study of perceptions as much as it is a study of observable social structure.
