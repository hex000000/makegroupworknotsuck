T1  - Systematic Integration of Quantitative Measures into the Qualitative Content Analysis of Constructs
AN  - 2280241925
AB  - Content analysis is a frequently applied technique used to pool the constructs obtained from a set of repertory grid interviews by creating categories containing constructs with similar meanings. In the standard procedure, the constructs are categorized by analyzing only the semantic information given in the construct poles. In a few cases in the literature, the analysis is additionally backed up using the results from isolated similarity scores, cluster analysis, or principal component analysis. This study provides a novel method to systematically integrate numeric measures of construct similarity into the process of content analysis. By mapping the construct similarity information into a color space, each construct receives a specific color value. Numerically similar constructs will have similar colors. By doing so, an additional and intuitive heuristic to match similar constructs is provided. This approach proves to be especially useful when construct descriptions are short or ambiguous and a large number of constructs have been elicited. The application of the method is demonstrated using a set of n = 63 repertory grid interviews containing a total number of k = 627 constructs.

T1  - Developing Measurable Cross-Departmental Learning Objectives for Requirements Elicitation in an Information Systems Curriculum
AN  - 2194501484
AB  - The ability to elicit information systems requirements is a necessary learning objective for students in a contemporary information systems curriculum, and is a skill vital to their careers. Common challenges in teaching this skill include both the lack of structure and guidance in information systems textbooks as well as the view that a student's education consists of a disparate set of unrelated courses. These challenges are exacerbated by faculty who focus only on their taught courses and by textbooks that often promote an isolated, passing glance at both the importance of and the idea behind requirements elicitation. In this paper, we describe a multi-year, faculty-led effort to create and refine learning activities that are aligned to requirements elicitation learning objectives both within and scaffolded across courses in a modern information systems curriculum. To achieve success in developing this marketable skill within information systems students, learning activities were integrated across the entire information systems major in a process we call Bloomification, where learning objectives, aligned learning activities, and courses are related and connected across the curriculum. This cross-departmental process is presented and lessons learned by the faculty are discussed.

AN  - 2136298138
AB  - The banking industry is experiencing rapid and widespread changes due to advances in technology that go hand-in-hand with the customer demands for real-time, personalized and seamless banking experience. Along with this development, omni-channel orientation is becoming an inherent feature of banking services. However, its role has not yet been thoroughly understood, specifically in this context. The purpose of this study is to create in-depth understanding of how do customers experience omni-banking services and what are the key factors related to their experiences. We identify both actual critical events and imaginings, positive and negative that are related to the forming of customer experiences and suggest both theoretical and managerial implications based on the results.

T1  - A Perceptual Evaluation of Individual and Non-Individual HRTFs: A Case Study of the SADIE II Database
AN  - 2250332725
AB  - As binaural audio continues to permeate immersive technologies, it is vital to develop a detailed understanding of the perceptual relevance of HRTFs. Previous research has explored the benefit of individual HRTFs with respect to localisation. However, localisation is only one metric with which it is possible to rate spatial audio. This paper evaluates the perceived timbral and spatial characteristics of both individual and non-individual HRTFs and compares the results to overall preference. To that end, the measurement and evaluation of a high-resolution multi-environment binaural Impulse Response database is presented for 20 subjects, including the KU100 and KEMAR binaural mannequins. Post-processing techniques, including low frequency compensation and diffuse field equalisation are discussed in relation to the 8802 unique HRTFs measured for each mannequin and 2818/2114 HRTFs measured for each human. Listening test results indicate that particular HRTF sets are preferred more generally by subjects over their own individual measurements.

T1  - Methodological proposals for the study of consumer experience
AN  - 2130760667
AB  - PurposeAs the consumer experience literature broadens in scope – specifically, from dyads to ecosystems and from provider-centric to consumer-centric perspective – traditional data collection methods are no longer adequate. In that context, the paper aims to discuss three little-used data collection methods that can contribute to this broader view of consumer experience.Design/methodology/approachThe paper identifies methodological requirements for exploring the broadened view of consumer experience and reviews data collection methods currently in use.FindingsThe paper elaborates tailored guidelines for the study of consumer experience through first-hand, systemic and processual perspectives for three promising and currently underused data collection methods: phenomenological interviews, event-based approaches and diary methods.Research limitations/implicationsAlthough the list of identified methods is not exhaustive, the methods and guidelines discussed here can be used to advance empirical investigation of consumer experience as more broadly understood.Practical implicationsPractitioners can apply these methods to gain a more complete view of consumers’ experiences and so offer value propositions compatible with those consumers’ lifeworlds.Originality/valueThe paper principally contributes to the literature in two ways: by defining the methodological requirements for investigating consumer experience from consumer-centric, systemic and processual perspectives, and by specifying a set of data collection methods that meet these requirements, along with tailored guidelines for their use.

T1  - Factors influencing student success on open-ended design problems
AN  - 2091028700
AB  - Open-ended design problems have become an important component in our educational landscape (Grubbs and Strimel in J STEM Teach Educ 50(1):77–90, 2015; Jonassen et al. in J Eng Educ 95:139–151, 2006; National Research Council in Education for life and work: developing transferable knowledge and skills in the 21st Century, National Academies Press, Washington, 2012; Strimel in Technol Eng Teach 73(7):8–18, 2014a). The ability of students to confront open-ended problem scenarios, think creatively, and produce novel designs have all been lauded as necessary skills for today’s twenty first century learners (Partnership for 21st Century Skills in P21 framework definitions, Author, Washington, 2016). This emphasis on open-ended design problems in problem-based learning scenarios has been tied to workforce and higher education preparation for students (National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council in STEM integration in K–12 education: status, prospects, and an agenda for research, National Academies Press, Washington, 2014; National Research Council in Engineering in K–12 education: understanding the status and improving the prospects, National Academies Press, Washington, 2009; Strimel in Technol Eng Teach 73(5):16–24, 2014b). However, little research has been conducted to identify the impact of potentially-influential factors on student success in such open-ended design scenarios. Therefore, the researchers examined data from 706 middle school students, working in small groups, as they completed an open-ended design challenge to determine the relationships between a variety of potentially-influential factors and student performance, as measured through adaptive comparative judgment. The analysis of the data revealed several relationships, significant and not significant, between identified variables and student success on open-ended design challenges.

T1  - Exploring the Visualization Design Space with Repertory Grids
AN  - 2067105265
AB  - There is an ongoing discussion in the visualization community about the relevant factors that render a visualization effective, expressive, memorable, aesthetically pleasing, etc. These factors lead to a large design space for visualizations. To explore this design space, qualitative research methods based on observations and interviews are often necessary. We describe an interview method that allows us to systematically acquire and assess important factors from subjective answers by interviewees. To this end, we adopt the repertory grid methodology in the context of visualization. It is based on the personal construct theory: each personality interprets a topic based on a set of personal, basic constructs expressed as contrasts. For the individual interpretation of visualizations, this means that these personal terms can be very different, depending on numerous influences, such as the prior experiences of the interviewed person. We present an interviewing process, visual interface, and qualitative and quantitative analysis procedures that are specifically devised to fit the needs of visualization applications. A showcase interview with 15 typical static information visualizations and 10 participants demonstrates that our approach is effective in identifying common constructs as well as individual differences. In particular, we investigate differences between expert and nonexpert interviewees. Finally, we discuss the differences to other qualitative methods and how the repertory grid can be embedded in existing theoretical frameworks of visualization research for the design process.

T1  - Examining positive and negative value-in-use in a complex service setting
AN  - 2025300099
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to advance research and practice on value, and more specifically value-in-use, by enhancing knowledge of not only positive but also negative value-in-use facets in a complex relational context, developing a psychometrically sound measure of these facets and evaluating their effect on various outcome measures across different customer segments.Design/methodology/approachA three-stage study was undertaken in the professional service context of financial planning. Following a qualitative stage identifying positive and negative facets of value-in-use, a measurement scale was developed and tested, and extended analysis was undertaken through two quantitative stages.FindingsThe findings provide converging evidence that clients in the study context realise value-in-use, defined in this study at a benefit rather than outcome level, through nine core facets, four positive (expertise, education, motivation, convenience) and five negative (monetary, time and effort, lifestyle, emotional [financial planner], emotional [situation]). While all nine facets impact on at least one of the investigated outcomes, results show that, overall, positive value-in-use facets outweigh the negative ones, with the impact of facets varying depending on client factors (such as customer participation and time to retirement).Originality/valueThe primary contributions of this paper lie in the conceptualisation and measurement of both positive and negative value-in-use facets and their interplay in generating customer outcomes, as well as in the development of a psychometrically sound measure of this construct. Negative value-in-use facets have not been explored to date, despite consumers being sometimes more concerned with risks than gains. Furthermore, the research offers novel insight into the impact of both positive and negative value-in-use on relevant outcomes, while also offering evidence as to the importance of segmentation dimensions in this context.

AN  - 2048029635
AB  - Objective: To identify and measure the relationships between quality-sacrifice-experience constructs and perceived value and satisfaction, and their relationship with the intention of repurchasing transportation logistics services by SMEs. Method: Starting from the proposition of scales to measure the constructs quality, sacrifices, experience, perceived value, satisfaction and intention to repurchase, a data survey was carried out, whose sample was composed of 195 SMEs. Using EFA techniques, CFA and MEEPLS, a model was proposed to measure the formation of perceived value in logistics services acquired by SMEs. Originality / Relevance : Most perceived value surveys in the B2B environment have considered the performance of goods and services in a functional perspective and overlooked non-rational dimensions. These dimensions (non-economic, subjective, and multidimensional aspects), if measured in conjunction with dimensions commonly encountered in B2B consumer behavior studies, may offer new perspectives of theoretical-empirical knowledge. Results: The sacrifices and exchange costs were non-significant in the B2B relationship. SMEs have valued aspects related to quality and experience. The study indicates that SMEs, by choosing as perceived value trainers experience and quality, and because they are influenced by satisfaction to form their repurchase intentions, manage their supply chain by establishing relationships wrapped in more subjectivities than one would expect from an entrepreneur. Theoretical / methodological contributions: Proposition of a theoretical model capable of predicting the repurchase intention of SMEs consuming logistic services, having as its predecessor the satisfaction, and as its own, the perceived value.

T1  - What Works? Toward a New Classification System for Mental Health Supported Accommodation Services: The Simple Taxonomy for Supported Accommodation (STAX-SA)
AN  - 2014818252
AB  - Inconsistent terminology and variation in service models have made synthesis of the supported accommodation literature challenging. To overcome this, we developed a brief, categorical taxonomy that aimed to capture the defining features of different supported accommodation models: the simple taxonomy for supported accommodation (STAX-SA). Data from a previous review of existing classification systems were used to develop the taxonomy structure. After initial testing and amendments, the STAX-SA and an existing taxonomy were applied to 132 supported accommodation service descriptions drawn from two systematic reviews and their performance compared. To assess external validity, the STAX-SA was distributed to a sample of supported accommodation managers in England and they were asked to use it to classify their services. The final version of the STAX-SA comprised of five supported accommodation ‘types’, based on four domains; Staffing location; Level of support; Emphasis on move-on; and Physical setting. The STAX-SA accurately categorized 71.1% (n = 94) of service descriptions, outperforming the comparison tool, and was not affected by publication date or research design. The STAX-SA effectively discriminated between ‘real world’ service models in England and 53.2% (n = 17) of service managers indicated that the taxonomy was ‘Very effective’ or ‘Extremely effective’ in capturing key characteristics of their service. The STAX-SA is an effective tool for classifying supported accommodation models and represents a promising approach to synthesizing the extant effectiveness literature. The authors recommend the development of reporting guidelines for future supported accommodation publications to facilitate comparison between models.

T1  - A cross-cultural perspective on relational exchange
AN  - 1933201499
AB  - Purpose 
This study aims to examine relational norms in cross-cultural business settings. Cross-cultural business partners may differ in their normative orientations toward relational exchange. Owing to the high extent of international trade, there is a need for developing a more nuanced understanding of cross-cultural relational exchange. 
Design/methodology/approach 
The repertory grid method was used to elicit the personal constructs characterizing the perceptions of business-to-business (B2B) relational exchange for 22 Russian and Finnish managers. These items were further categorized into categories of relational elements drawn from relational exchange literature using a content analysis. Then, the category means of scored importance and scored evaluations of domestic and foreign business partners were tested statistically. 
Findings 
Relational norms of flexibility, information exchange, long-term orientation, mutuality and solidarity were equally important to both Russian and Finnish managers. The importance of a business partner's ability seems to be culturally dependent. Sharing the same cultural background might have an adverse effect when evaluating poorly functioning business relations. 
Research limitations/implications 
The validity of these findings is limited to this context and material. Future research should repeat cross-cultural comparisons of the relational norms with more data and other nationalities. 
Practical implications 
Firms should focus on long-term orientation and mutual targets to form well-functioning cross-cultural business relationships. 
Originality/value 
This study provides new knowledge into B2B marketing literature by revealing the role of relational norms, business partner's ability and shared cultural background on functionality of cross-cultural business relations. It also demonstrates the use of the repertory grid method in studying perceptions of relational norms.

T1  - An empirical examination of the services triangle
AN  - 1901642379
AB  - Purpose 
The "services triangle" is a dynamic model in which three interlinked entities (customer, employee and firm) combine to create three dyads [employee-firm (EF), customer-firm (CF) and customer-employee (CE)] that work together to deliver services. This study aims to determine whether significant differences existvis-à-vis the impact of EF, CF and CE dyads on the service experience. 
Design/methodology/approach 
Empirical evidence from data garnered from 398 surveys was used to test a conceptual model. To test the hypotheses, like-signed first-order dyads were constructed and combined to create second-order dyads, and analysis of variance and post-hoc tests (least significant differences) were used to investigate whether differences among the second-order dyads exist. 
Findings 
The analysis reveals the differential impact of the three services triangle dyads on the service experience. Specifically, customers' perception of EF fit appears to have the greatest impact on customers' evaluation of the service experience, followed by CF and CE fit. 
Research limitations/implications 
The main implication is that this paper extends conceptual research by providing empirical evidence that the EF dyad is the foundation of the services triangle. The limitations are based primarily on methodology, where the use of a survey to collect data rules out the potential generalizations of true cause and effect while also potentially being subject to common method bias. 
Practical implications 
Managers should realize that fit within some dyads is more instrumental in determining the service experience than fit within others. A number of managerial implications are proposed and discussed. 
Originality/value 
Prior research has neither empirically examined the services triangle nor whether significant differences exists among the impact of its dyads on the service experience. Insights from various literatures, the application of the balance theory and the construction of first- and second-order dyads enables an investigation of the various relational patterns contained in the services triangle.

T1  - Diagnosing service quality using customer reviews: an index approach based on sentiment and gap analyses
AN  - 1834763100
AB  - Recognizing the importance and potential benefits of customer reviews as a source of the voice of customers, this study proposes an analytic framework and procedures for analyzing customer reviews--termed a customer review-based gap analysis--that are tailored to diagnosing service quality. To this end, we conduct sentiment analysis on customer reviews to capture customers' perceptions and expectations at the service-feature level, which are not expressed explicitly in their reviews. A case study of a mobile navigation service shows that the customer review-based gap analysis can provide the practical information required to diagnose service quality from customer review data. The suggested indexes for capturing customers' perceptions and expectations reveal quality strengths and drawbacks at the service-feature level. In addition, incorporating these indexes into those for quality performance and objectives based on a service-feature hierarchy provides a diagnostic tool capable of examining service quality in both overall as well as detailed aspects.

T1  - The role of customer brand engagement and brand experience in online banking
AN  - 1826442918
AB  - Purpose              The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which the customer-brand engagement influences the brand satisfaction and the brand loyalty in an online banking context. It further explores the role of the online brand experience as a mediating variable amidst the relationship of customer-brand engagement with brand satisfaction and brand loyalty.              Design/methodology/approach              This study has used 348 responses been collected through an online survey which was conducted among various online bank customers in Delhi, the national capital of India. The responses were analyzed by the means of the confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling.              Findings              The results of online survey show that customer-brand engagement positively influences online brand experience. The effects of customer-brand engagement on brand satisfaction and brand loyalty are partially mediated by the online brand experience. Mediation of online brand experience produces the stronger effects as compared to those direct effects of the customer-brand engagement on the brand satisfaction and the brand loyalty.              Practical implications              This study suggests bank managers to develop strategies that could be able to increase the levels of the customer-brand engagement in an online setting because of its scheduled effects on the online brand experiences and the consumer behavioral outcomes.              Originality/value              This research is the first-of-its-kind that examines the effect of customer-brand engagement on the customers' brand experience, brand satisfaction and brand loyalty in the online banking context.

T1  - Influences of customer participation and customer brand engagement on brand loyalty
AN  - 1826809425
AB  - Purpose              Value co-creation assumes that customers take active roles and create value together with firms. This paper aims to investigate the short- and long-term effects of customer participation on brand loyalty, through brand satisfaction. Participation effects were also examined among social media-using customers with the additional explanatory factor of brand engagement.              Design/methodology/approach              Two studies were conducted among insurance customers: a cross-sectional study using a nationwide sample (N = 954) and a subsample of social media users (N = 145) to examine short-term effects, and a longitudinal study using data from three assessment timepoints (N = 376) to enable empirical long-term testing.              Findings              The cross-sectional study showed positive short-term effects of customer participation on brand loyalty, mediated by satisfaction. Among customers using social media, positive participation effects gained from brand engagement strengthened brand satisfaction. The longitudinal study did not show similar positive long-term effects of customer participation.              Practical implications              These findings help deepen service marketers' understanding of the possible short-term effects of customer participation and customer brand engagement, and caution them to not expect that customer participation will have long-term positive satisfaction and loyalty effects.              Originality/value              This research provides interesting short- and long-term findings, due to the complementary cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs.

T1  - The effects of three customer-to-customer interaction quality types on customer experience quality and citizenship behavior in mass service settings
AN  - 1826809611
AB  - Purpose              Creating superior customer experience quality is important to firm success, but the link between customer experience quality and customer-to-customer interaction quality - a critical component of customer experience quality in mass service settings - has seldom been spotlighted. This paper aims to propose and test a theoretical model of the relationship among three types of customer-to-customer interaction quality (friend-interaction, neighboring customer-interaction and audience-interaction) and customer experience quality. They also examine these variables' effects on customer citizenship behavior in mass service settings.              Design/methodology/approach              The authors collected data through a self-administered survey. The proposed relationships were tested using structural equation modeling.              Findings              Friend-interaction and audience-interaction quality perceptions significantly influence customer experience quality, with neighboring customer-interaction quality perception significant only for low communication quality. We find that enhancing customer experience quality is crucial to promoting citizenship behavior in mass service settings.              Practical implications              Neighboring customer-interaction quality perception has a significant effect on customer experience quality, particularly in a low communication quality situation. Therefore, service marketers should provide effective neighboring customer-interaction management schemes to enhance experience quality together with friend-interaction and audience-interaction management schemes when customers experience low communication quality. Additionally, service marketers should focus on enhancing communication quality only when anticipating low neighboring customer-interaction quality.              Originality/value              The findings highlight the effects of three types of customer-to-customer interaction quality on customer citizenship behavior through experience quality perception in mass service settings, and the effect of neighboring customer-interaction quality perception on customer experience quality, moderated by communication quality.

T1  - What matters to infrequent customers: a pragmatic approach to understanding perceived value and intention to revisit trendy coffee café
AN  - 1789394995
AB  - Notwithstanding the rise of trendy coffee café, little is done to investigate revisit intention towards the café in the context of developing markets. In particular, there is a lack of study which provides theoretical and practical explanation to the perceptions and behaviours of infrequent customers. Hence, the study aims to look into the subject matter by using the theory of reasoned action and social exchange theory as the underpinning basis. The framework proposed by Pine and Gilmore (Strat Leadersh 28:18-23,  2000 ), which asserts the importance of product quality, service quality and experience quality in a progressive manner, is used to decompose perceived value in the model so as to determine their effects on intention to revisit the café. Given the importance to gain practical insights into revisit intention of infrequent customers, pragmatism stance is assumed. Explanatory sequential mixed-method design is thus adopted whereby qualitative approach is used to confirm and complement quantitative findings. Self-administered questionnaire-based survey is first administered before personal interview is carried out at various cafés. Partial least squares structural equation modelling and content analysis are appropriated successively. In the quantitative findings, although product quality, service quality and experience quality are found to have positive effect on perceived value and revisit intention towards trendy coffee café, experience quality is found to have the greater effect than the others among the infrequent customers. The qualitative findings not only confirm their importance, but most importantly explain the favourable impressions they have at trendy coffee café based on their last in-store experience. While product and service quality might not necessary stimulate them to revisit trendy coffee café, experience quality driven by purposes of visit would likely affect their intention to revisit. As retaining customers is of utmost importance to businesses, and infrequent customers more than often make up the majority of the customers, the study provides meaningful and practical understanding of revisit intention.

T1  - Pharmacist-led minor ailment programs: a Canadian perspective
AN  - 2232099469
AB  - Pharmacists have a long history of helping Canadians with minor ailments. This often has involved management with over-the-counter medications. If pharmacists felt that the best care required something more robust, they would refer the patient to a physician. In hopes of improving the care of such ailments, Canadian provinces have granted pharmacists the option of selecting medications traditionally under physician control. This review examines the Canadian perspective on pharmacists prescribing for minor ailments and the evidence of value for these programs. It might provide guidance for other jurisdictions contemplating such a move.

T1  - Collaborating to compete: The role of collective creativity in a South African clothing design small business
AN  - 1896059369
AB  - Background: The number of apparel manufacturers in the South African clothing and textile industry is diminishing due to competition with importing apparel manufacturers. Nevertheless, South African small and micro-businesses still manufacture clothing products to meet the needs of the local markets. 
Aim: This study set out to explore and describe the role of collective creativity in the design process of a South African clothing small business that provides innovative clothing to local niche markets. 
Setting: The small and micro-businesses are typically owned by designers who can be viewed as artisan entrepreneurs. However, the competition for the local market is very competitive, and innovative designs and design processes can promote the competitiveness of the clothing small and micro-businesses. 
Method: A case study research design was implemented in the study, which included qualitative research methods. Semi-structured interviews, participant observation and analysis of the products against an innovation design framework were done. 
Results: The findings suggest that a collaborative design process supports the collective creativity of the particular owner-designers. Collective creativity enables innovative clothing products that result from the design process and it also reduced the perceived risk that the owner-designers experienced with regard to launching a ready-to-wear range. 
Conclusion: It is argued that collective creativity contributes to sustaining innovative design and enhances abductive reasoning for problem solving. Abductive reasoning, which is typically associated with design thinking, could be important for entrepreneurial thinking and recommendations in this regard are made.

T1  - Cloud-Based Parameter-Driven Statistical Services and Resource Allocation in a Heterogeneous Platform on Enterprise Environment
AN  - 1831818545
AB  - A fundamental key for enterprise users is a cloud-based parameter-driven statistical service and it has become a substantial impact on companies worldwide. In this paper, we demonstrate the statistical analysis for some certain criteria that are related to data and applied to the cloud server for a comparison of results. In addition, we present a statistical analysis and cloud-based resource allocation method for a heterogeneous platform environment by performing a data and information analysis with consideration of the application workload and the server capacity, and subsequently propose a service prediction model using a polynomial regression model. In particular, our aim is to provide stable service in a given large-scale enterprise cloud computing environment. The virtual machines (VMs) for cloud-based services are assigned to each server with a special methodology to satisfy the uniform utilization distribution model. It is also implemented between users and the platform, which is a main idea of our cloud computing system. Based on the experimental results, we confirm that our prediction model can provide sufficient resources for statistical services to large-scale users while satisfying the uniform utilization distribution.

T1  - ANALYSIS OF INFLATION MANAGEMENT MODEL FACTORS AS REGARDS SUPPLY AND DEMAND
AN  - 1788578119
AB  - This article analyses the demand and supply aspects of the determinants of CPI inflation in Lithuania in 1998-2008. Content analysis was used to identify and group significant demand and supply inflation factors and using RGT, objectively assess and generalize the results. Pair linear correlation analysis confirmed the significance for CPI inflation of the factors identified through content analysis, and both research methods reliably and effectively helped to identify factors for regression models of inflation. Content analysis revealed that the causes of inflation most often mentioned and traditionally regarded as significant in the economic literature are factors such as money and wages, capital, competition and monopolies, and so on. Pair correlation research showed the significance for inflation of supply and demand factors such as income distribution, income levels, taxes, saving, human capital and labour productivity as well as exports and imports - things which content analysis gave only average or little mention. Regression models confirmed and helped to concretize the significance for inflation of the identified demand and supply factors. The results of the research show that inconsistent monetary and general government expenditure policies reinforce private consumption and capital shocks. Note that human capital and employment, which changed little during the analysed period, did not show the large significance for inflation that they are commonly thought to have.

T1  - The mediating role of interpersonal conflict at work in the relationship between negative affectivity and biomarkers of stress
AN  - 1728359207
AB  - This study examined the association between interpersonal conflict at work (ICW) and serum levels of three possible biomarkers of stress, namely the pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1[beta]), Interleukin 12 (IL-12), and Interleukin 17 (IL-17). Additionally, this study investigated the role of negative affectivity (NA) in the relationship between ICW and the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Data from 121 employees in an Italian healthcare organization were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results showed that ICW was positively associated with IL-1[beta], IL-12, and IL-17, after controlling for the effect of gender. Moreover, ICW completely mediated the relationship between NA and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1[beta], IL-12, and IL-17. This mediating effect was significant after controlling for the effect of gender. Overall, this study suggests that work-related stress may be associated with biomarkers of inflammation, and that negative affectivity may influence the stress process affecting the exposure to psychosocial stressors.

T1  - Mitigating reputational risks in supply chains
AN  - 1698360118
AB  - Purpose              - The purpose of this paper is to explore reputational risk that are borne in the supply chain and contribute to this contemporary but growing research stream.              Design/methodology/approach              - First, a theoretical framework is provided to help in the characterisation of reputational risks and how they impact supply chain members that may be multiple tiers away from the manufacturer. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners who were familiar with reputational risks and who were engaging in varying mitigating techniques. Cognitive modelling was utilised to report the findings.              Findings              - The practitioners in this paper were very familiar with the risks and were active in varying mitigating practices as budgets and resource constraints would allow. The brevity of the risks identified and the significance of specific risks with how they impact a reputation was revealed. Mitigation is an ongoing and haphazard process with very little information available as would be expected with a typical risk management approach.              Research limitations/implications              - This paper serves to provide practitioners insight into the varying methods used by firms with supply chain members that number in hundreds. Based on our findings, a recommendation was made that utilise corporate social responsibility as a foundation that is proposed to address a number of risks including those related to price, availability and quality. The limits of this work are that it is specific to a select group of practitioners specialised in this area. Although the information is rich, it is not generalisable.              Originality/value              - This paper makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing insight into the perceptions of practitioners who make decisions on mitigating reputational risks. The results suggest that this is a very new area of management that is striving to find a way to minimise their exposure.

T1  - Change? What Change? Mature Management Students' Construal of Learning Events in a Systems Thinking Course at a South African University
AN  - 1696633411
AB  - This study investigated mature management students' experiences with learning systems thinking. The context of the study is an interdisciplinary postgraduate management course in the engineering faculty at a South African University. Twenty-two students were interviewed to investigate their experience of learning events in the context of this course. The analysis, using grounded theory principles, resulted in identification of changes that were coded as four categories of consequences. These include, change in thinking, change in approach to problem solving, change as personal development and change in worldview. These findings make a contribution to understanding the learning of systems thinking. Applications for this research for management educators and practicing managers include: 1. a framework to help educators design meaningful experiences for learners and 2. a basis for understanding what constitutes systemic management practice and explaining differential development.

T1  - Impact of information security initiatives on supply chain performance: An empirical investigation
AN  - 1634006577
AB  - Purpose              - The purpose of this empirical research is to attempt to explore the effect of information security initiatives (ISI) on supply chain performance, considering various intra- and inter-organization information security aspects that are deemed to have an influence on supply chain operations and performance.              Design/methodology/approach              - Based on extant information security management and supply chain security management literature, a conceptual model was developed and validated. A questionnaire survey instrument was developed and administered among supply chain managers to collect data. Data were collected from 197 organizations belonging to various sectors. The study used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis for data analysis. Further, to test the hypotheses and to fit the theoretical model, structural equation modeling techniques were used.              Findings              - Results of this study indicate that ISI, comprising technical, formal and informal security aspects in an intra- and inter-organizational environment, are positively associated with supply chain operations, which, in turn, positively affects supply chain performance.              Research limitations/implications              - This study provides the foundation for future research in the management of information security in supply chains. Findings are expected to provide the communities of practice with better information security decision-making in a supply chain context, by clearly formulating technical, formal and informal information security policies for improving supply chain performance.              Originality/value              - In today's global supply chain environment where competition prevails among supply chains, this research is relevant in terms of capability that an organization has to acquire for managing internal and external information security. In that sense, this study contributes to the body of knowledge with an empirical analysis of organizations' information security management initiatives as a blend of technical, formal and informal security aspects.

T1  - Blissed ignorance?: The role of process information on consumer evaluation of a typical Italian salami
AN  - 1660954455
AB  - Purpose              - The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of information on origin, "typicalness", production method and flavour on the willingness to pay and the sensorial appreciation of Tuscan sanguinaccio (Italian Salami).              Design/methodology/approach              - The goal of the study was to explore how differences between willingness to pay and sensorial appreciation (measured using a hedonic score) for the three types are influenced by the nature of the sensorial and non-sensorial information available to the consumer. To evaluate reaction to sensorial information, typical information regimes used in works on degree of disconfirmation (Schifferstein, 2001) were adopted, that is, visual examination of the product with indication of the name and tasting of the labelled product.              Findings              - Analysis of the results of the experiments indicates that Mallegato and Biroldo have particular characteristics that make it critical to promote them to a vast public. The information on the production methods and ingredients seemed to interact negatively with the sensorial perception of the product after tasting, probably because of the presence of blood and other problematic components (for example, components of the pig head in Biroldo) among the ingredients.              Research limitations/implications              - Limited size of the sample and a gastronomic niche product analyzed.              Practical implications              - The negative influence of the processed information has to be considered to efficiently communicate the typicalness of these salami products. In fact, whilst for other traditional products, different kinds of information related to process, raw materials, recipes and, more generally, tradition can be jointly used to increase the arousal and the expectation on products quality characteristics, in this case, the communication strategy has to carefully consider the limit of these product components.              Originality/value              - For the first time the use of experimental auctions investigate the role of problematic information, such as the presence of blood, on consumers' preference towards a typical gastronomic product.

T1  - Making Sense of Denial in Sexual Offenders: A Qualitative Phenomenological and Repertory Grid Analysis
AN  - 1524252486
AB  - Denial in sexual offenders represents the first barrier to successful treatment a clinician is likely to face. Most sex offender treatment programs devote significant time to overcoming denial, with most programs having a focus on disclosure and "accepting responsibility." This is the first study that has aimed to make sense of sexual offenders' denial through a rigorous qualitative analysis. The main objective was to explore the experiences and lived worlds of sexual offenders in denial. A qualitative phenomenological methodology combining interpretative phenomenological analysis and repertory grids was implemented. Ten incarcerated sexual offenders in categorical denial participated in the research. The analysis revealed the narrative, relational, and self-reconstructive properties of denial and discusses the role and function denial may be playing for sexual offenders. The results highlight that denial can be viewed as a form of "sense making" and that clinically relevant treatment targets can be elicited without disclosure. It is concluded that viewing denial as a barrier to treatment impedes constructive work with offenders, and implications for treatment are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mindtool-Assisted In-Field Learning (MAIL): An Advanced Ubiquitous Learning Project in Taiwan
AN  - 1528873338
AB  - Scholars have identified that learning in an authentic environment with quality contextual and procedural supports can engage students in thorough observations and knowledge construction. Moreover, the target is that students are able to experience and make sense of all of the learning activities in the real-world environment with meaningful supports, such that their learning motivation can be promoted, knowledge can be sensibly constructed, and skills can be fully developed. To develop potential tutoring strategies and learning activity models using mobile, wireless, and sensing information and communication technologies (ICT) in a real-world learning environment, a four-year national e-learning research project entitled “Mindtool-Assisted In-field Learning (MAIL)” has been funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan since 2008 in an effort to lead the development and innovation of Learning Technology. The integrated project aimed to develop Mindtool-assisted knowledge construction models, assessment models, guidance models, and reflection strategies for cutting-edge context-aware ubiquitous learning. Moreover, a series of learning activities has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and models. Each year, more than 1,500 students have participated in the in-field learning activities with the designed approaches. Based on the results of a series of experiments, it was found that the students’ learning performance as well as their in-field inquiry ability was significantly improved, showing the effectiveness of the Mindtool-assisted ubiquitous learning approach and the success of the MAIL project. In this paper, the background, objectives, theoretical foundations, systems, research issues, applications, and findings of the MAIL project are presented. Finally, the scaling-up plan for applying these research-proven learning models to all levels of educational settings in Taiwan is also addressed.

AN  - 1528148908
AB  - The paper brings together current views on emotional complexity. Its aim is to introduce this term and its potential application with emphasis on cognitive aspects. Due to relatively high inconsistency in definitions of emotional complexity (and emotion in general), the following aspects of emotional complexity are presented: 1) dialecticism, 2) independence between experienced emotions, 3) emotional granularity, 4) level of emotional awareness. The relationship between emotional and cognitive complexity is discussed. Moreover, the methodologies employed most frequently - description of past experience, experience sampling measures, emotion self-monitoring, and narrative approaches - are debated with respect to their limitations. Lastly, the authors address the development of emotional complexity and related psychological constructs (e.g. emotion regulation). Examples from clinical populations are provided to illustrate an importance of emotional complexity in various psychological disorders and the usefulness of the concept in psychotherapy.

T1  - The role of reflection in expert teacher instruction
AN  - 1637641727
AB  - Teachers in K-12 education have a difficult and sometimes chaotic work life. However, the experts in the field make difference in the lives of the students they teach. These effects are seen even years after the course has ended. Quality teaching has been shown to affect employability and even wage attainment for students. The purpose of this qualitative research study was to find ways to view the role reflection plays in the practice of expert teachers and to enter the world of an expert teacher through their description and narrative of how they go about their practice. High School mathematics teachers in a Title I school system in the southwest United States participated in this study. Participants were both male and female math teachers, and had from twelve to twenty-eight years of classroom teaching experience. Class schedules included both block and traditional periods. Observation and interview were used to gain understanding of teachers' worldview. Repertory grid elicitations were used to record the constructs these teachers held regarding practice. It was found that the use of active learning, especially group work and tutoring, helped the students retain content at greater levels for superior performance on the Advanced Placement and other standardized tests. In addition, these exemplars exhibited a great degree of collegiality with others on the staffs in their schools and in professional conferences and other activities. They used routine and structure to build a safe place for students to learn. Their respect and warm regard for students was evident throughout the study. Teacher-student relationships were important and shown to be nurtured. The teachers studied were shown to believe that their practice was a partnership in learning with their students. They were always available for tutoring and to help the students in their efforts to comprehend the material and achieve high marks on standardized tests. The performance of these students reaches some of the highest levels in the nation. The aim is to better understand how expert teachers think about their practice, and how they use reflection to achieve superior performance in the classroom.

T1  - Are you providing the "right" customer experience? The case of Banca Popolare di Bari
AN  - 1437233724
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to model customer experience (CE) as a "continuum", labelled customer experience continuum (CEC). The paper adopts a CE quality construct and scale (EXQ) to determine the effect of CE on a bank's marketing outcomes. The paper discusses the study's theoretical and managerial implications, focusing on CE strategy design. Design/methodology/approach - The paper empirically test a scale to measure customer experience quality (EXQ) for a retail bank. The paper interviews customers using a means-end-chain approach and soft-laddering to explore their CE perceptions with the bank. The paper classifies their perceptions into the categories of "brand experience" (pre-purchase), "service experience" (during purchase), and "post-purchase experience". After a confirmatory factor analysis, the paper conducts a survey on a representative customer sample. The paper analyses the survey results with a statistical model based on the partial least squares method. The paper tests three hypotheses first, Customers' perceptions of brand, service provider, and post-purchase experiences have a significant and positive effect on their EXQ, second, EXQ has a significant and positive effect on the marketing outcomes, namely share of wallet, satisfaction, and word-of-mouth, and third, the overall effect of EXQ on marketing outcomes is greater than that of EXQ's individual dimensions. Findings - The results of the statistical analysis support the three hypotheses. Practical implications - Banks should focus their CE strategies on the CEC and not on single encounters, tailoring marketing actions to specific stages in a customer's CE process. Different organisational units interacting with customers should be integrated into CE strategies, and marketing and communication budgets should be allocated according to CEC analysis. The model proposed in this paper enables the measurement of the quality of CE and its impact on marketing outcomes, thus enabling continuous improvement in CE. Originality/value - The research proposes a different view of CE by modelling the interaction between company and customer as a continuum (CEC). It provides further empirical validation of the EXQ scale as a means of measuring CE. It also measures the impact of CE on a bank's marketing outcomes. It discusses the guidelines for designing an effective CE strategy in the banking industry.

T1  - The feel of experience: phenomenological ideas for organizational research
AN  - 1441371384
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at how phenomenology can be used to explore the meaning and experience of organizational life. It argues that phenomenology provides more than just themes or leitmotifs for post hoc analysis of narrative data; in its basic formulation, phenomenology is a way of thinking - a method - which illuminates the embodied, subjective and inter-subjective qualities of the life-world. Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows Husserl's command to "go back to the things themselves" to access raw experience, asking ourselves, "what does experience mean phenomenologically?" We draw on the work of Merleau-Ponty to "flesh out" the embodied aspects of that phenomenological experience, outlining how the idea of a "field of presence" grounds our reflections in the here-and-now and gives our selfhood its coherence. Findings - The paper presents data on the diverse meanings of "experience" to suggest that phenomenological and organizational understandings can be differentiated in terms of both temporality and selfhood. The paper argues that these differentiations expose different ways of thinking about the world more generally, drawing on Husserl's philosophy of the "natural attitude" to propose that one of its derivations, an "organizational attitude", is obscuring our view of embodied experience. Practical implications - The paper provides practical guidelines for those interested in researching the embodied, experiential qualities of organizational life. These emphasize the need to suspend the "organizational attitude", modify how the authors position and explain the research, and attend to the interplay between the felt sense of the world and the words used to articulate it. Originality/value - The logic of the body helps the authors to work towards a more integrative, conciliatory epistemological position for qualitative organizational research. The paper uses a phenomenological view of embodiment - as both subjectively experienced and objectively presented to the world - to suggest that the body, particularly when it is sick, is giving us clues for how to conceptualize the life-world of work.

T1  - Information richness on service business websites
AN  - 1346641175
AB  - Delivering rich information is the key success factor for service business websites. Numerous studies have investigated useful guidelines to deliver rich information. The implicit assumption made by these studies is individual homogeneity. This study argues that this is only one side of the story, as individual heterogeneity is also important. Specifically, this study questions relationships between personal dispositional factors and the person's perception of information richness. Dispositional factors of interest are age and personality. This study adopted information processing theory as its theoretical lens. A review of literature through the lens leads to the development of six hypotheses. The insurance industry provided the context of this study. Data were collected from 110 potential customers of 10 insurance organizations. The Hierarchical Linear Modeling technique was utilized for model building and hypotheses testing. The result revealed that aging individuals often find information as low in richness. Furthermore, those with high consciousness and extraversion generally perceived information as higher in richness. Lastly, the other three dimensions of personality showed no association with information richness.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The impact of outcome quality, interaction quality, and peer-to-peer quality on customer satisfaction with a hospital service
AN  - 1355291855
AB  - Purpose - Creating superior customer satisfaction has been considered one of the keys to the firm's success and hence, the antecedents of customer satisfaction have been examined numerous times. However, the link between customer satisfaction and peer-to-peer quality, which is deemed a critical component of customer experience quality, has not been spotlighted despite its importance. The purpose of this paper is to propose and test a theoretical model of the relationship among outcome quality, interaction quality, peer-to-peer quality, and customer satisfaction as well as these variables' impacts on customer loyalty. Design/methodology/approach - To test the model, the authors conducted a survey and collected self-administered data for data analysis. The proposed relationships were then tested using structural equation modeling. Findings - The findings indicate that outcome quality, interaction quality, and peer-to-peer quality perceptions significantly influence customer satisfaction, which, in turn, greatly influences customer loyalty. This study shows that outcome quality, interaction quality, and peer-to-peer quality should be considered pivotal elements in creating customer satisfaction and that customer satisfaction should be treated as a strategic variable to enhance customer loyalty. Originality/value - The present study examines the role of familiarity as a moderating variable, finding that outcome quality has a significant influence on customer satisfaction only when patients are familiar with services provided by a hospital. That is, the influence of outcome quality on customer satisfaction becomes greater as customers become more familiar with hospital services, which are characterized as credence services. The finding is noteworthy in that it expands our understanding of the relationship between outcome quality and customer satisfaction.

T1  - Facilitating Different Types of Clusters
AN  - 1348895962
AB  - This paper focuses on cluster facilitators and their efforts in facilitating the development of clusters. At present, the vast majority of literature presents a uniform image of cluster facilitators despite the fact that different types of clusters influence their role and purpose. Thus, the aim of this paper is to explore how the roles and purposes of cluster facilitators change when facilitating various cluster types, and the impact of those changes on the cluster facilitation performed. The findings show that cluster facilitators in Marshallian/Italian industrial district type of clusters play the role of match makers and organisers; in the Hub-and-spoke district type of clusters, the cluster facilitators perform the roles of developer and organiser; cluster facilitators in the Satellite industrial platform type of clusters are promoters and organisers; and in the State-anchored industrial district type of clusters, the cluster facilitators fulfil the roles of integrator and organiser. This conclusion is based on a multiple case study as well as on a selection of literature on clusters and cluster facilitation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Responsible school management: Literature research and empirical study on a conceptual basis for an ethical responsible management in secondary schools in Flanders
AN  - 1467758152
AB  - This research is meant to be an effort to explore, analyse and determine responsibility as regards the management of schools, based on the concepts and insights in business ethics. The central problem posing searches for an answer to the question what a principal exactly means, when using the word 'responsible'. Put in a negative way it is neither the aim of this research to explore the implementation of applied ethics in the curriculum op the schools, nor to explore the meaning and impact of the ethical dimension within Flemish educational politics.    Among others 'school ethics' opens a new and deeper approach of well-known educational concepts as educational quality and policy pursuing competence, and the theories behind them. It also outlines a cluster of (existing) concepts permitting to look in a more differentiated and so more balanced way to the ethical dilemmas and decisions with which a school, and more especially its principal, is confronted. Furthermore this field research offers a first insight in the intuitive opinion of principals of Flemish secondary schools about their professional responsibility. With this PhD-research a start has been made for a scientifically grounded study of the ethical dimension within the policy and management of school organisations. In this the philosophy of prof. Emmanuel Lévinas and the stakeholder approach of prof. Ed Freeman are crucial.    With the implementation of the issue of responsibility in the policy and management of school organisations, and so of their principals, this study supplies a new and actual interpretation of the recently appropriated / assigned autonomy of the school within a hectic and ever-changing environment, perpetually calling for transparency and accountability about the offered quality. It may be called clarifying to notice that in this research a lot of principals do not yet have a clear opinion on this issue; it is however also motivating to notice that they experience and accept this responsibility, though in an intuitive way.

T1  - Impact of retailer personality on consumer-based retailer equity
AN  - 1179714885
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of retailer personality on consumer-based retailer equity. Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed a retailer personality scale and find its impact on consumer-based retailer equity by adopting the scale developed by Pappu and Quester. A mall-intercept survey was undertaken using a systematic sampling of department store shoppers of age 18 years and above in a metropolitan city, Kolkata, India. The questionnaire was used to collect data from seven department retail brands. The impact of each retailer personality dimension on each consumer-based retailer equity dimension was explored, using structural equation modeling. Findings - The study proposed a five-dimensional scale to measure department store personality. Results indicated that the three dimensions of store personality, namely sophistication, dependability and empathy, have significant positive impact on each consumer-based retailer equity dimension except one (empathy[arrow right]retailer loyalty). The remaining two dimensions of retailer personality, namely authenticity and vibrancy, have no impact on each consumer-based retailer dimension. Originality/value - The paper is the first to propose a scale for measuring department store personality and to explore the link between retailer personality and consumer-based retailer equity.

T1  - Using diamond ranking as visual cues to engage young people in the research process
AN  - 1625565554
AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe and consider the use of diamond ranking activities as visual cues to elicit ideas, prompt reflection and promote discussion amongst pupils (aged 10-13), teachers and other staff in two qualitative research studies. The activities included nine photographs as visual cues, and participants cut out these pictures and stuck them onto a piece of A3 paper in a diamond shape, ranking them by position where their preferred picture is at the top and the most disliked at the bottom. Importantly, participants also annotated their diamond with qualitative comments and explanations. This article explores the use of diamond ranking as visual cues -- a tool within qualitative research that is under-developed -- as a way of engaging participants in the research process. Issues explored include inclusivity, active discussions and applicability to a wide range of people.

T1  - Strategic capabilities and their relationship to organisational success and its measures
AN  - 888250493
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the strategic capabilities that are related to success in five disparate Australian industries. Design/methodology/approach - Five studies were conducted using a generative multi-stage research approach in order to determine the capabilities that are related to success in the management consulting, advertising and IT industries, legal profession and top 500 listed companies. Findings - There is a clear commonality of capabilities across all studies. These are quality of service, particularly customer service; good leadership and vision, which encourages innovation and creativity; selection and retention of excellent staff with good technical skills; credibility, integrity and honesty; excellent differentiated product(s) or service(s); and adaptability and flexibility. In general the capabilities were significantly related to the organisational success measures. Research limitations/implications - The study could be extended to other Australian and international industries. Originality/value - Organisations that develop and implement resources to be proficient in all these capabilities should achieve increased success measured by a mix of hard and soft performance indicators. Our study is differentiated because the drivers and, indeed the indicators, of success have been proffered by executives themselves (not just the literature), who were located in disparate industries. Their views are deemed important because Australia's economy emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial economy and avoided a recession.

T1  - Cognição do Ambiente Competitivo: um Estudo dos Construtos Mentais Utilizados por Proprietários de Pequenas Empresas/Cognition of the Competitive Environment: a Study of Mental Constructs Used by Small Business Owners
AN  - 1476893598
AB  - The cognitive approach may be useful in understanding the elements that pervade the process of analyzing organizations' competitive environment. Respecting its complexity, the approach helps in understanding managers' intentions and their processes of world representation. Consistent with this proposal, this article aims to identify and analyze the mental constructs used by managers to assess their competitive environment and highlights the association among such constructs with reference context (RC) and sector of activity. The method allied quantitative and qualitative procedures and differentiates itself from other studies in the use of Kelly's Repgrid. This technique has as its main premise that the understanding of the world is associated with the categorization of elements of perception by individuals. The sample consisted of 48 small industrial firms located in Curitiba-PR. The results indicated that the set of constructs used is unique to each leader; however cognitive commonalities could be noticed in the more frequent use of six constructs. The analysis shows that managers' adoption of constructs is not dependent on RC and on sector of activity as well. The findings allow inferences about the mental constructs of the respondents in terms of their frames of reference and the assessment of the competitive environment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - DETERMINANTS OF E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, TRUST, AND LOYALTY IN SAUDI ARABIA
AN  - 858786354
AB  - Managing customer trust, satisfaction, and loyalty attitudes of e-commerce services is very important for the long-term growth of many businesses. Previous research has shown that e-retailers experience difficulty maintaining customer loyalty despite the recent rapid growth in Business to Customer (B2C) e-commerce applications. Numerous studies have empirically examined B2C e-commerce customer trust, satisfaction, and loyalty attitudes in various countries. Nevertheless, empirical research on these key constructs of e-commerce in developing Arab countries is generally limited. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to identify the factors that influence the extent to which Saudi consumers trust, are satisfied with, and are loyal towards B2C e-commerce. This study draws on previous research to build a conceptual framework which hypothesizes relationships between these three e-commerce constructs and their antecedents. A survey was conducted among B2C e-commerce customers in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia using a structured self-administered questionnaire. The findings of this study show that B2C e-commerce customer loyalty in Saudi Arabia is strongly influenced by customer satisfaction but weakly influenced by customer trust. The study limitations, implications, along with directions for further research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mining deeper meaning in consumer decision maps
AN  - 754173265
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to gain deeper insight into the meanings that structure and impel consumer choice by overlaying findings from a metaphor elicitation study onto the results of a traditional means-end laddering study. First, laddering interviews were conducted to elicit the reasons that structure the college choice decision of students. A second study using metaphor elicitation techniques surfaced additional meanings that constitute and connect students' thoughts and feelings about their experiences at the college. Together, the two modes of interviewing yield deeper insight into personal relevance and consumer choice than offered by either alone. Combining two modes of interviewing provides views at various levels of detail. Whereas laddering interviews use direct questioning to identify consumers' choice criteria, projective techniques rely on indirect questioning to surface the enduring and ephemeral feelings that charge consumer beliefs. Panning and zooming from the general structural overview provided by means-end research to the nuance and detail surfaced by metaphor elicitation provides uncommon insight into the drivers of consumer choice. The time, effort, skill, and expense required for data collection, analysis, and interpretation are non-trivial and may limit adoption of the two study approach. The superimposition of metaphoric meanings onto consumer decision maps provides tremendous added value to managers aiming to enhance the creativity, relevance, and effectiveness of their marketing initiatives.  Melding two interview methods adds depth to means-end research and lends structure to projective associations. The deeper insights into personal relevance and choice benefit academics and practitioners alike.

T1  - COLOR AND STORE CHOICE IN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE: THE EXPLANATORY ROLE OF TRUST
AN  - 848216633
AB  - In marketing, researchers of atmospherics have shown correlations between ambient color and purchase related variables. In contrast, little attention has been paid to website color in electronic commerce. We provide evidence of the effect of color on simulated store choice. We show that the difference in trust between blue and green stores is significant, and that store choice is highly correlated to the difference in trust. In effect, trust is a significant explanatory variable in the relationship between color and store choice. The significance of the results is discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Improving the Communication Skills of IS Developers during Requirements Elicitation using Experiential Learning
AN  - 200137095
AB  - The improvement of communication skills among Information Systems (IS) developers can be considered as a strategy to mitigate the risk of project failure during IS design. This paper addresses issues on various communication barriers normally encountered during its requirements elicitation (RE) stage. This study aims to adopt experiential learning as a method to improve the communication skills of IS developers during RE techniques such as prototype presentations. As such, an educational multimedia, which teaches communication skill enhancement among professionals during presentations, served as an interventional tool for experiential learning. Using a longitudinal quasi-experiment, the developers' self-assessments of their communication skills during prototype presentations at pre- and post-intervention were compared and analyzed using the WordStat® software. Responses showed significant improvements on the presentation skills especially on keywords-in-context related to the audience, information, interest, prototype, room, summary, and talk. This signifies the influence of such learning method to the developers at post-intervention. Further, the study implies that experiential learning can be empirically supported to effectively motivate IS developers in improving their presentation skills after receiving a learning intervention. Thus, experiential learning can be used by project managers as an effective training strategy to improve the communication skills of their IS developers in preparation to current and future projects on IS design especially during prototype presentations of the RE stage.

T1  - Articles;   An approach for ontology development and assessment using a quality framework
AN  - 203470724
AB  - Ontologies have been identified as important components of a number of types of information systems, including data warehouses, e-commerce systems and knowledge management systems, and the quality of such systems is therefore likely to be heavily dependent on the quality of the embedded ontology. An ontology can be studied from two perspectives; the Artificial Intelligence (AI) perspective and the philosophical perspective. The research presented in this paper takes the AI perspective in which an ontology is considered to be an engineering artefact that can be represented using a specific vocabulary. The paper describes an approach to the development, representation and evaluation of formal ontologies with the explicit aim being to develop a set of techniques that will improve the coverage of the ontology, and thus its overall quality. The proposed approach will be illustrated by applying it to the development and evaluation of an ontology for the information technology infrastructure at a university campus. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Store owner's reactions to a corporation's takeover of a shopping centre in an Australian city
AN  - 210950538
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect that the acquisition of a shopping centre by a corporation had on individual retailers in the complex. It examines how imposed directive change impacted on the internal customers, namely the retailers operating within the shopping centre. Design/methodology/approach - Four methods are used to procure the data, namely, observations, content analysis, interviewing and a questionnaire survey. Findings - Key findings are that the majority of retailers feel that the nature of the change is transitional or transformational, are negative about it and many do not resist it because they feel helpless to do so. However, some resistance to the acquisition, cynicism and rumours about it, are present. Retailers feel that communication, education, participation and negotiation would help to reduce these negative reactions to change. Practical implications - To improve the outcome of a similar acquisition in the future, The paper recommends extensive consultation with retailers before the change programme begins. Suggestions regarding how a similar acquisition could be more successfully implemented in the future are provided. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the current body of academic literature on change management and shopping centre management practice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT

T1  - POSTTRAUMATICKÝ ROZVOJ: VÝZKUM, DIAGNOSTIKA, INTERVENCE
AN  - 235724197
AB  - The overview study proceeds the previous study dealing with theories and models of posttraumatic personality growth. It presents the overview of most frequent quantitative and qualitative methods for posttraumatic growth diagnostics and discusses the psychological problems which the measurement of positive changes is competing. It draws attention to wider context of posttraumatic growth from the content and research aspects: it doesnot concern the individual only but also the group and human community; not only the actual experience of participants but whole their life course; not only one generation but the development of human species. Considering the work of Christopher the study points to broader bio-psychosocial developmental context of human coping with traumas brought by the life. The special attention is paid to directed interventions. The therapeut has to the disposal two approaches: the general one for all posttraumatic interventions, and the specific one for posttraumatic growth. The examples from literature illustrate how the helping professionals can help the individuals coping with trauma not only to reach the pre-traumatic level but to get over it, to find a new sense of life.

T1  - Evolution of an IS development effort: An ANT interpretation
AN  - 1011980033
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to stand back from the debate of success and failure and develop an interpretive account based on narratives of major actors to enable project managers with a rich understanding of a complex organisation. Design/methodology/approach - Actor network theory (ANT) was the method that was applied to both frame and sum narratives that were gathered from the six subjects along with anecdotal evidence and confidential documents used for this research. Findings - Success is based on the perception of both actors as well as the principal audience of the Commonwealth Games (CWG). Second information systems (IS) success is uniquely associated to an event like the CWG. Research limitations/implications - Most of the data used for the research was after the conclusion of the games. Therefore usefulness of interpretation may have a time dimension. Probably if the subjects had included spectators and other project managers during the games, the quality of conclusions could have been further enriched. Practical implications - Project managers of future events may be able to internalise the role of co-ordination and agreement that is necessary among different actors to achieve success. Originality/value - Originality of present paper stems from its "unusual" identification of success - as it has attempted to outline distinctions between certainty of success and anything contrary to success. Project managers, organisers and researchers of IS projects are likely to find value in the paper in being able to appreciate the evolutionary nature of IS success.

T1  - Behavioral frontiers in choice modeling
AN  - 204485389
AB  - We review the discussion at a workshop whose goal was to achieve a better integration among behavioral, economic, and statistical approaches to choice modeling. The workshop explored how current approaches to the specification, estimation, and application of choice models might be improved to better capture the diversity of processes that are postulated to explain how consumers make choices. Some specific challenges include how to capture and parsimoniously describe heterogeneous mixes of heuristic choice rules, methods for building realistic models of choice, and nontraditional methods for estimating models. An agenda for important future work in these areas is also proposed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Modeling competencies for supporting work-integrated learning in knowledge work
AN  - 230318288
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to suggest a way to support work-integrated learning for knowledge work, which poses a great challenge for current research and practice. The authors first suggest a workplace learning context model, which has been derived by analyzing knowledge work and the knowledge sources used by knowledge workers. The authors then focus on the part of the context that specifies competencies by applying the competence performance approach, a formal framework developed in cognitive psychology. From the formal framework, a methodology is then derived of how to model competence and performance in the workplace. The methodology is tested in a case study for the learning domain of requirements engineering. The Workplace Learning Context Model specifies an integrative view on knowledge workers' work environment by connecting learning, work and knowledge spaces. The competence performance approach suggests that human competencies be formalized with a strong connection to workplace performance (i.e. the tasks performed by the knowledge worker). As a result, competency diagnosis and competency gap analysis can be embedded into the normal working tasks and learning interventions can be offered accordingly. The results of the case study indicate that experts were generally in moderate to high agreement when assigning competencies to tasks. The model needs to be evaluated with regard to the learning outcomes in order to test whether the learning interventions offered benefit the user. Also, the validity and efficiency of competency diagnosis need to be compared to other standard practices in competency management. Use of competence performance structures within organizational settings has the potential to more closely relate the diagnosis of competency needs to actual work tasks, and to embed it into work processes. The paper connects the latest research in cognitive psychology and in the behavioural sciences with a formal approach that makes it appropriate for integration into technology-enhanced learning environments.

T1  - Follower characteristics and the perception of leader-member exchange
AN  - 215870024
AB  - This study aims to focus on the perception of leader-member exchange (LMX). It is assumed that the perceived quality of the relationship is not only related to the actual quality of the relationship, but also to followers' expectancies and preferences. However, little is known about person characteristics that are related to LMX perceptions. This study seeks to examine how far followers' leadership-related characteristics (romance of leadership, idealised supervisor, need for leadership and dependence) are related to the perception of LMX. A sample of 588 Dutch employees from different professions filled in questionnaires on romance of leadership, idealised supervisor, need for leadership and dependence and their perception of LMX. Results indicate a positive relationship between need for leadership/dependence and the perception of LMX, thought not for romance of leadership/idealised supervisor and the perception of LMX. An interaction was found between idealised supervisor and dependence on the perception of LMX. The study only focuses on four antecedents, although many others could have an effect on the perception of LMX. The study comprised a one-dimensional assessment of LMX. For future research, a multi-dimensional assessment is recommended. The results of this study imply that organisations need to address the expectations that followers have towards their leaders in order to avoid disappointments.  This paper focuses on the perception of LMX and how follower characteristics are related to the perception of LMX. It extends prior research on the perception of leadership into LMX research. Similar to effect on the perception of leadership behaviour, effects on the perception of LMX are important to take into account when LMX is assessed through follower ratings in order to avoid making incorrect conclusions.

T1  - Lament of the ignored expatriate: An examination of organisational and social network support for female expatriates in China
AN  - 199676419
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between gender and the individual and social aspects of expatriate work, emphasising how issues external to the organisation impact on the experience of female expatriates.  In total, 102 male respondents and 44 female respondents were surveyed in order to test the perceived organisational support, career satisfaction, and expatriate social support. Significant gender-related differences were identified in all three areas with notable contradiction in the perception and practice of how multinational corporations (MNCs) manage their expatriates. While earlier research suggested that organisations perceived their treatment of female expatriates to be equivalent to that of men, the results indicate that female international managers do not perceive equal treatment on international assignments.  Although based on a smaller sample than other international studies, the gender breakdown was sufficient for moderated regression testing.  As the expatriate social support construct is largely exploratory in nature, future research could examine the effect of perceived expatriate social support on other related workplace behaviours, both domestically and internationally, including work-life balance and diversity management.  While other studies have provided a rich descriptive picture of the gendered nature of expatriation, little research has attempted to quantify the reasons behind the phenomenon. This paper addresses this gap in the literature through exploration of the issues, which impact upon the experience of female expatriates in foreign MNCs in China. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Validating the Fun Toolkit: an instrument for measuring children's opinions of technology
AN  - 218367115
AB  - The paper presents the Fun Toolkit (v3), a survey instrument that has been devised to assist researchers and developers to gather opinions about technology from children. In presenting the toolkit, the paper provides a reflective look at several studies where the toolkit has been validated and considers how the Fun Toolkit should be used as well as discussing how, and in what way, the instruments contained within it should be employed. This consideration of use is one of the novel contributions of the paper. The second major contribution is the discussion based around software appeal; in which the fit between the Fun Toolkit and usability and engagement is explored. The paper concludes that the Fun Toolkit is useful, that it can be used with some confidence to gather opinions from children and that it has the potential for use for other user experiences.

T1  - The role of cognitive complexity and self -monitoring in counselor development
AN  - 304641558
AB  - This study examined the self-rated development in cognitive complexity, autonomy, and self-other awareness of master's-level counselor trainees during the internship year. Participants were 70 internship students enrolled in four counseling programs in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. With the cooperation of internship instructors, the researcher collected data at one of the first class meetings in September, then obtained follow-up data seven months later at one of the final class meetings. Instruments used were the Learning Environment Preferences (LEP; Moore, 1987), the Self-Monitoring Scale (SMS; Snyder & Gangestad, 1986), and the Supervisee Levels Questionnaire-Revised (SLQ-R; McNeill, Stoltenberg, & Romans, 1992). Demographic data, including race/ethnicity and age, were also collected.    It was hypothesized that cognitive complexity, self-other awareness, and autonomy would increase over the course of the year. To test this hypothesis, a repeated-measures MANOVA was performed with cognitive complexity, self-other awareness, and autonomy as the dependent variables. It was also hypothesized that cognitive complexity at the beginning of the year would predict self-other awareness and autonomy at the end of the year. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to test this hypothesis. Finally, it was hypothesized that there would be a significant correlation between self-monitoring and autonomy at the beginning of the year and a significantly weaker correlation at the end of the year.    Results indicated partial support for these hypotheses. While self-other awareness and autonomy significantly increased over the course of the year, cognitive complexity did not. Cognitive complexity at Time 1 predicted self-other awareness at Time 2, but not autonomy. Finally, there was no significant relationship between self-monitoring and autonomy at Time 1.    It was noted that there was a main effect for race/ethnicity on cognitive complexity, with White students scoring significantly higher than non-White students. Areas for future research are suggested, including further validation of cognitive complexity assessment instruments, obtaining ratings from supervisors and clients, and examining the possible moderating role of anxiety.

T1  - Improving the Tender Stage through Integrating Collaborative Extranet with Project Integrated Databases
AN  - 208174436
AB  - A gap between the well structured matrix of communication/processes and the generated 'added value' provided by collaborative extranets on one hand and the inability to exchange the project information at the element level on the other hand has emerged for the whole construction cycle in general and more specifically for the tendering stage. The objective of this study is to bridge this gap through the development of an augmented process model and system architecture which will enable integrated databases to support collaborative extranets at the tender stage with a minimum degree of resistance and 're-engineering'. In order to achieve the objective of this study a hybrid qualitative and quantitative research methodology 'pragmatic researcher' was adopted coupled with interviews and case studies for data collection and analysis respectively. This research was able to identify object/element entities along with their related attributes that need to be mapped against the existing product model standards in order to either revise the existing standards or develop the needed extensions.

T1  - Patient-reported outcomes measurements in epilepsy
AN  - 920111426; 20528420
AB  - This review was designed to explore and review the range of patient-reported outcomes used to assess people with epilepsy. Literature searches were conducted through EMBASE.com and supplemented with hand searching of relevant articles. References obtained through hand searches were compared with EMBASE.com citations until we were confident that the review had reached a point of saturation. The search included English language papers published between January 1997 and March 2007. Searching through EMBASE.com yielded a total of 110 hits and the hand searches identified 35 potentially relevant studies. A total of 61 studies were considered relevant to the current review and were included in the study. Several instruments that have been designed and validated to measure patient-reported outcomes in an epilepsy population are currently being used, including the Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE)-89 and -31, the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale and the Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory. In addition, the QOLIE-adolescent (QOLIE-AD)-48 and the Adolescent Psychosocial Seizure Inventory have been designed for use with adolescent epileptic patients. We found a paucity of valid condition-specific instruments assessing patient preference and patient satisfaction in this population. Several condition-specific instruments exist to measure patient-reported outcomes in epilepsy, specifically in the areas of health-related quality of life, patient-reported symptoms and psychosocial functioning. However, measures designed to assess other areas of patient-reported outcomes, such as patient preference and satisfaction, are poorly developed.

T1  - Doing research on emotion and virtual work: A compass to assist orientation
AN  - 231405427
AB  - The aim of this article is to offer a structuring device for research on emotion and virtual work. I refer to this structuring device as a compass. It embraces the different perspectives organizational researchers may adopt to address emotion and virtuality and illustrates the questions and findings that arise out of these perspectives. As such, the compass is a guide to the possibilities and limits of research on emotion, virtual work, and their interplay, and a tool for developing and combining research questions from multiple perspectives.

T1  - Development of a private sector version of the (Engaging) Transformational Leadership Questionnaire
AN  - 226929119
AB  - Notions of leadership change over time. The last two decades have been dominated by US models of "heroic" leadership, based largely on predominately male-biased samples, which have been focused on studies of "distant" leaders, but these are being challenged by the findings from more recent studies which question the potential dangers of adulating the few "gifted" "charismatic" individuals, not least of which because of the disasters they may cause. In addition, there is a growing interest by organisations of identifying how they can increase "engagement" amongst their employees, since this process appears to contribute significantly to organisational success. This study seeks to replicate an earlier study of "nearby" leadership in UK public sector organisations. The study gathers qualitative data from a sample of female and male managers at various levels in three UK FTSE100 companies, developing a pilot questionnaire, and then gathering quantitative data from 743 managers in a range of UK and Hong Kong private sector organisations, and testing the validity of the instrument in predicting job satisfaction, motivation, commitment, and other psychological variables found to affect performance.

T1  - Attracting for values: an empirical study of ASA's attraction proposition
AN  - 215870529
AB  - This paper seeks to report an empirical test of Schneider's attraction proposition that organizations attract similar types of people. The person-people (PP), person-group (PG) and person-organization (PO) fit of applicants to eight utility firms were compared with the similar fits of members of a suitable comparison group. The results show an effect for person-vocation (PV) fit but, once this is controlled for, all significant effects disappear. In other words, the PP, PG and PO fits of applicants to the utilities were no different from those in the comparison group once PV fit was controlled for. These results suggest that applicants choose which organization to apply to based on their desire for a particular type of work rather than their attraction for particular companies, which is contrary to Schneider's attraction proposition. One reason for this might be the nature of graduates who are largely unaware of the organizational environments to which they are applying. Drawing from the interpersonal attraction literature, it is argued that applicants need familiarity, proximity and exposure to the organization for Schneider's attraction proposition to appear. These results suggest graduates choose vocations over organizations and that, if organizations wish to attract people who share their values, they need to put more effort into their recruitment efforts than those described in this study. The absence of an attraction effect suggests that, when applicants make attraction decisions based on their perceived fit, they may not be supported by an actual congruence. This study extends previous work by including multiple conceptualizations of fit, by including person-group and person-people fits in addition to person-organization fit.

T1  - Consumer research: extrinsic variables in food studies
AN  - 225134703
AB  - The article aims to address two questions: "What are the important extrinsic variables in consumer food studies?" and "Which are focused on the most?" An extensive search of previous literature was conducted to find data on papers related to extrinsic variables in food studies. Both an electronics search through computerized library databases (Web of Science, Food Science and Technology Abstract), and reference lists from relevant research papers were used. The article finds that acceptance and intention to purchase measures regarding foods are associated with consumption and purchase process and are used as an indirect way of obtaining data to understand consumer behavior. Although the importance of intrinsic variables such as color, aroma, flavor and texture in food acceptance and choice are very well recognized, several studies have shown that other variables also play an important role in food acceptance, preference, choice and intention to purchase. This article presents the more studied extrinsic variables using the conjoint analysis and repertory grid methods. This article shows data only on repertory grid and conjoint analysis. There are other methodologies such as focus group, laddering interviews and questionnaires that can be used to investigate the role of extrinsic variables on consumer attitude. Context variables are the most studied extrinsic variables. Production method, nutritional information, protected denomination of origin/certification and origin are some of these variables and are directly linked with consumer concerns about the product. The authors believe that the change in consumer behavior globally drives the search for motives that better explain choices.

T1  - Guiding Organizational Identity Through Aged Adolescence
AN  - 203307448
AB  - In this article, the authors reflect on the past two decades of research on organizational identity, looking to its history and to its future. They do not provide a review of the literature, nor do they promote a particular perspective on the concept. Instead, they advocate pluralism in studying organizational identity while encouraging clarity and transparency in the articulation of definitions and core theoretical suppositions. Believing there is no one best approach to the study of organizational identity, their intent is to establish a reference point that can orient future work on organizational identity. They focus on three questions they feel are critical: What is the nomological net that embeds organizational identity? Is organizational identity "real" (or simply metaphoric)? and How do we define and conceptualize organizational identity? Last, they try to anticipate organizational identity issues on the horizon to suggest future directions for theory and research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Quality of life in older people: a structured review of self-assessed health instruments
AN  - 888718755; 20528554
AB  - A range of terms (including quality of life, health-related quality of life and health status) describe a broad set of aspects of self-reported health that can be captured by questionnaires and related instruments. Health in older people particularly requires attention to broader aspects of the impact of health on physical, social and psychological function. A structured review was performed to assess how well such issues are measured by available instruments. A total of 45 instruments were identified that have received some degree of evaluation to establish their use in assessing the health of older individuals. Two types of instruments were included in the review: generic and older-people-specific instruments. The SF-36 has by far the largest evidence base to support its use in older people. The OMFAQ has the best evidence base amongst older-people-specific instruments. Many instruments have only minimal evidence of measurement properties. Concepts such as quality of life are still defined and used in a variety of ways, and  major questions must be addressed before uniform practice emerges in this important area of health policy.

T1  - The importance of consumers' perceived risk in retail strategy
AN  - 237028016
AB  - Gaining and sustaining a strategic competitive advantage in retailing requires knowledge of the attributes consumers value and use to discriminate between stores and why those attributes are important. The purpose of this article is to propose and examine a method to help retailers understand grocery consumers' store choice processes as a function of the linkages between store attributes, shopping motives and risk dimensions which can help them develop a more coherent and clearer positioning strategy. Means-end chain analysis is used to explore how grocery customers build a mental link between store attributes, the consequences of not having those attributes, and the motives for seeking them. The findings suggest that shoppers' motives are linked to only four main risk dimensions, namely time, financial, psychosocial and physical, and we present evidence for reassessing store positioning strategies, giving more emphasis to the risks involved.

T1  - Appraisal of traumatic stressors: A structural multidimensional model
AN  - 305345031
AB  - This exploratory study addresses the neglected issue of the definition and classification of traumatic stressors by bridging such areas of psychological knowledge as traumatic stress, structural appraisal of emotions, and semantic differential. The strengths and shortcomings of the existing “objective” theoretical classifications are discussed, and a new 6-dimensional system, based on subjective cognitive appraisal dimensions, is proposed and empirically validated.    Eighty-two undergraduate students evaluated the descriptions of 24 traumatic events, using a newly developed Semantic Differential for Appraisal of Traumatic Stressors (SDATS), consisting of 33 bipolar adjective pairs. The reduction of this data via Principal Components Analysis confirmed the central hypothesis about 6-dimensional appraisal structure of traumatic events. Obtained Expectedness, Intentionality, Intensity, Scope, Controllability, and Distance dimensions together explained 88.30% of total variance. Independent sample t-tests revealed significant relations between certain cognitive appraisal dimensions and some demographic and pre-existing trauma variables. The results demonstrate more negative evaluation of traumatic stressors in three groups, especially along the Intensity and Distance dimensions: (1) in women as compared to men; (2) in participants of foreign origin as compared to their USA counterparts; and (3) in a group reporting high cumulative psychological impact of primary and secondary traumatic exposure as compared to the low-impact group. Among interactions of response styles with demographic and trauma characteristics are: (1) extreme responding in women as compared to more moderate responding in men; (2) preference for extreme values in participants of foreign origin compared to the choice of moderate and neutral values in their USA counterparts; and (3) preference towards neutral values in the high- as compared to low-impact trauma group.    A hypothetical model of the relationship between found cognitive appraisal dimensions/scales and post-traumatic outcomes is proposed, based on Lazarus's model of stress and coping, Green's psychosocial model of PTSD, and her work on classification of traumatic stressors. Literature associated with the stressor-outcome relationship is discussed and the implications of this model for future research are outlined. The usefulness of SDATS as a unique tool allowing comparisons across different types of traumatic events is stressed. And, finally, potential cognitive appraisal-based mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities to PTSD are proposed.

T1  - Contextual Influences on Culture Research: Shifting Assumptions for New Workplace Realities
AN  - 221205014
AB  - This article argues that different contexts in politics, economics, and society have shaped existing conceptions of culture in the field of international cross cultural management research, such as cross-national comparison (CNC) and intercultural interaction. This has led to different assumptions about culture that have, in turn, influenced research methodologies and research questions. An examination of recent changes that have impacted on work realities, and hence the research context, leads us to conclude that the assumptions underlying the dominant CNC perspective, as well as a fundamental construct in the intercultural interaction perspective, no longer fit most work contexts. We describe the multiple cultures perspective as an alternative research paradigm for investigating culture, since its underlying assumptions are shaped by the new work realities. Finally, we explore some key issues and challenges for researchers in the field that influence the way research is currently conducted and will be conducted in the future. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An understanding of geography: The perspectives of English primary trainee teachers
AN  - 223670153
AB  - There have been few studies of trainee teachers' conceptions of the term 'geography'. Building on these, this study identifies a number of conceptions of geography held by primary school trainee teachers in England. Their ideas are compared with their understanding of the reasons for teaching geography to young children. Similar outcomes emerge. While a small number of primary trainee teachers see geography education as concerned with the study of places, a slightly larger group view teaching geography as developing children's sense of responsibility for the earth and its people. However, by far the largest groups of students perceive geography's role to be to develop younger children's awareness and knowledge of the environment. Additionally, a sizeable group of trainees see geography as providing knowledge about the features and countries of the world. The implications of these findings are considered for the brief geography study units which primary teacher trainees take as part of their initial teacher training programme in English higher education. The conclusion is that it is important to widen primary trainee teachers' perspectives during even the briefest of units, not least to enable them to teach the national curriculum requirements for geography in primary schools.

T1  - The utility of a broader conceptualization of organizational identification: Which aspects really matter?
AN  - 199407847
AB  - Predictions of social identity and self-categorization theories about the relevance of social identification in organizational contexts are presented. The researchers propose that different foci of identification (e.g. with own career, team, organization, occupation) as well as different dimensions of organizational identification (cognitive, affective, evaluative, and behavioral) can be separated. Furthermore, these different aspects of organizational identification are assumed to be differentially associated with work-related attitudes and behaviors. Predictions are first tested in a questionnaire study of 515 German school teachers. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that dimensions and foci can indeed be differentiated. In addition, results indicate that different aspects correlate differentially with different criteria. The results are cross-validated in two samples of 233 German school teachers and 358 bank accountants, respectively. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Managing the design-manufacturing interface
AN  - 232357842
AB  - This paper describes the major barriers across the design-manufacturing interface and examines ways to overcome them to achieve a smooth production start-up. An integration model reveals that formalization facilitates a smooth production start-up. Independent of the degree of formalization during the early development stages, a formal approach is preferred when the new product is introduced into production. Another facilitating factor is the empathy from design towards manufacturing, which can be stimulated by managerial actions. Although the complexity and newness of product and technology hinder a smooth production start-up, their effect seems to vanish by introducing formalization and by striving for a design team that has empathy towards manufacturing.

T1  - A study and comparative analysis of managerial and leadership effectiveness in the National Health Service: An empirical factor analytic study within an NHS Trust hospital
AN  - 236477537; 12396550
AB  - The research described in this article was concerned primarily with identifying the criteria of managerial/leadership effectiveness applying at the middle and front line levels of management within an NHS Trust Hospital using critical incident technique and factor analysis methods. The findings suggest that the self-perceptions of managers and the perceptions of superiors and subordinates are very similar, and only differ on a limited number of criteria. This challenges the 'perspective-specific' models of managerial effectiveness advocated by some researchers. The results are compared against those from a near identical study carried out by the author within one part of the British Civil Service, and the results from a different but comparable factor analytic study carried out by other researchers elsewhere in the NHS. The results suggest the existence of generalized criteria of managerial effectiveness, which lend considerable support to the notion of the 'universally effective manager'. This challenges the 'contingent models' of managerial effectiveness advocated by various expert commentators. In addition, the research supports the new model of transformational leadership offered by Alimo-Metcalfe and Alban-Metcalfe for application within both the NHS and local government, and adds to the empirical base supporting the current drive towards evidence-based practice in management within the healthcare sector.

T1  - The student food shopper: Segmentation on the basis of sttitudes to store features and shopping behaviour
AN  - 225120888
AB  - Although students have several characteristics in common with the 18-24-year-old youth group, they have many distinguishing features and merit consideration as a separate segment. Yet very little academic research has looked at the student market, although over recent years commercial marketers have begun to take more interest in this group. This paper reports the results of a study of student food shopping behavior. It is concerned especially with establishing the dimensions underlying the importance that students attach to supermarket store attributes, exploring the existence of student segments and subsequently, to profile the segments in terms of shopping behavior and attitudes to store features. The empirical results indicate that there are four dimensions that underlie the importance of store features. These are defined respectively as economy, finance, products, personnel and access. Subsequently, two clusters are identified. The cluster profiles indicate that the clusters are distinguished by their financial situation.

T1  - An integrated approach to the elicitation of customer requirements for engineering design using picture sorts and fuzzy evaluation
AN  - 195892966
AB  - Product definition is widely accepted as one of the key factors to be considered in the early stage of product design and development. It has a direct impact on the success of a new product in the marketplace. Frequently, product definition is solicited through the voice of the customer (VoC). As such, an organization will obtain a prominent competitive edge over its competitors if it is able to effectively capture the genuine VoC or the requirements of a customer. Sorting techniques provide a means to elicit customer requirements. Although a number of sorting techniques were developed, few of them are able to handle the uncertainty and imprecision inherited from the VoC and subjective judgment because of their crisp decision making. An integrated approach is described, which is based on repeated single-criterion sorts and fuzzy evaluation, for the elicitation of customer requirements. The details of the integrated approach are presented. The approach is validated using a case study on the design of a wooden golf-club head. The details of the validation are discussed.

T1  - How To Develop Visions: A Literature Review, and a Revised CHOICES Approach for an Uncertain World
AN  - 211456099
AB  - This paper reviews the visioning literature along five key dimensions: analysis of an organization's current situation, assessment of the external environment, identification of desired future vision, connection of the future to the present state, and testing the vision. It then describes one particular participative visioning methodology, which has largely been used in the public sector, the CHOICES approach. The paper then analyzes the CHOICES approach along the five key dimensions identified earlier. Gaps in the approach are identified and a revised methodology is outlined. The paper ends with a summary of results from a pilot study which tested the revised methodology. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The List of Individual Symptoms for Therapy Evaluation (LISTE) -- An efficient method for individualized outcome assessment
AN  - 214269003; 11794556
AB  - An newly developed method for individualized assessment of therapy outcome, the "List of Individual Symptoms for Therapy Evaluation" (LISTE), is presented together with first empirical results on its testmetric properties and experience with this assessment instrument is reported. The LISTE method is an approach for objective 2-point assessment of therapy outcome which aims to use the advantages of individualized assessment methods while avoiding the known disadvantages to a considerable extent. So far, the results and experience with this method are very encouraging. The results of a first empirical evaluation indicate that the method supplies clinically relevant and objective data relating to treatment outcome, and that the method has acceptable testmetric characteristics in terms of sufficient reliability and validity values. Furthermore, the LISTE method is convenient for interviewing the therapist, parents and patients, it is neither expensive nor time consuming, and is compatible with clinical routine. The method requires little training and involves little additional effort. It can be used for face-to-face interviews or telephone interviews, and can also be applied as a paper-and-pencil test. Iissues of application and the need for further studies are discussed.

T1  - Global strategic analyses: Frameworks and approaches
AN  - 210518323; 01782251
AB  - Geographic, economic, cognitive, and social farces can influence the ways in which the inimitable resources of firms and their competitors are defined and evaluated in a globally competitive environment.  This article traces how academic research on strategy has attempted to address how firms identify their core competencies and competitive resource advantages at both the firm and national level.  The ways in which managers can attempt to identify a competitive reference group as a benchmark for evaluating their company's relative strengths and weaknesses are discussed.  Finally, an integrated conceptual framework that can be used to inform managerial strategic analysis and decision making in a globally competitive environment is developed.

AB  - This paper explores the application of personal construct elicitation techniques to the identification of the situational factors that managers of bespoke information system development projects take into account when planning new projects for new customers. It is shown that the personal constructs elicited reflect most of the contingency variables and risk-drivers mentioned in the information systems development literature, but also include some situational characteristics not addressed in this literature. It is concluded that personal construct elicitation techniques have a valuable role to play in information systems development research.

T1  - Cognitive complexity in group performance and satisfaction
AN  - 304271855
AB  - In this study, a comparison was made between the various levels of group cognitive complexity and its relationship to task performance and task satisfaction. The goal of this research is to answer the general question, "Should decision-making groups consist of individuals who are similar in the way they differentiate and/or integrate various stimuli in order to increase performance and satisfaction?"    The preceding research problem was analyzed in a laboratory setting using a 2 x 2 factorial design blocked on the variable, cognitive complexity. The Repertory Grid was used to measure the cognitive complexity of 228 student subjects. These subjects were stratified into groups of three based on their cognitive complexity score on the Repertory Grid (Kelly, 1955). Each group was treated randomly with one of two levels of task complexity (complex or not complex). Moreover, the groups received an imposed group structure that incorporated centralized or decentralized decision-making.    Results indicated that groups consisting of cognitively complex members outperformed groups consisting of noncomplex members. No support was obtained for the two-way interaction between group cognitive complexity and either task complexity or group structure. Support was obtained for the interaction between task complexity and group structure on both task satisfaction measures. The highest satisfaction levels occurred with a complex task in a decentralized structure. In addition, the three-way interaction effect on the task satisfaction scale between group structure, task complexity, and group cognitive complexity was significant. The means, however, were not in the predicted direction. For cognitively simple groups, a complex task with a decentralized structure lead to the highest task satisfaction level; whereas, a less complex task with a decentralized group structure lead to the lowest task satisfaction score for noncomplex members. There were no significant differences for cognitively complex groups when analyzing the three-way interaction between group cognitive complexity, task complexity, and group structure.

T1  - What You Know Is What You Get From Experience TEAM EXPERIENCE RELATED TO TEAMWORK SCHEMAS
AN  - 232783366
AB  - Team members with different levels of experience may understand the process of teamwork very differently and if these differences were identified, team training, team management, and team performance may be enhanced. In the present study, representations of teamwork knowledge as a function of team experience were investigated. Teamwork knowledge structures, or teamwork schemas, were assessed using multidimensional scaling and "freehand" concept maps. Consistent with contemporary expert-novice literature, the results revealed that higher experience team members conceptualized teamwork more concisely and in more abstract terms than did lower experience team members. In addition, results from the two methodologies converged to a greater degree for higher experience individuals than for lower experience individuals suggesting that higher experience individuals can express consistently what they understand about teamwork. The results suggested that team training should be designed based on trainees' prior team experiences and teamwork knowledge. Team managers might also keep in mind potential team members' experience levels when making team assignments.

Polarity suggests that pertinence has two foci: one that centers on aspects of the subject matter and its universe (topicality) and one that encompasses the user and his or her insertion into and use of that universe (informativeness). This study applies Kelly's Personal Construct Theory to the concept of pertinence. Kelly's theory postulates that people seek to predict and control the course of their lives by constructing personal mental models of the world, reflected as abstracted structures which channel ize behavior and activities. Personal constructs con cerning pertinence were elicited from five subjects based on self-selected information sources used in an information problem. These constructs were then arranged in two ways by three other subjects: by perceived similarity and by foci. Constructs are ex amined for sibling similarity, consistency of applica tion, and their relationship to relevance judgments. The arrangements of constructs were examined for congruity by examining participation of different con struct builders in the same arrangement and overlap of members between sets in different arrangements. Findings show that individuals' personal constructs exhibit both similarity and dissimilarity; that indi viduals apply their construct system consistently; relevance may be a equivalent for two documents, but the ratings of those documents on a person's con structs tend to differ personal systems are built from similar constructs, but the structuring of constructs differs between individuals; and topicality and in formativeness do emerge as observable foci of the concept of relevance.

T1  - A Synthesis of Research on Requirements Analysis and Knowledge Acquisition Techniques
AN  - 218126388; 00619080
AB  - Many entities and processes involved in requirements analysis (RA) and knowledge acquisition (KA) are almost identical.  In order to facilitate a merged awareness of both research streams, representative RA and KA techniques are compared.  These techniques are grouped according to elicitation mode into 3 dimensions: 1.  communication obstacles, 2.  a technique's locus of control, and 3.  the nature of the understanding gained from using the technique.  The categorization scheme used indicates that techniques from RA and KA address very similar issues.  For example, methods that originated in RA and that are used to overcome a specific communication obstacle have counterparts originating in KA that can help overcome the same obstacle.  Suggestions are provided for a variety of research projects that could be beneficial to both research streams.

T1  - Monitoring Communication Effects: A Cognitive Structure/Cognitive Response Approach
AN  - 223328779
AB  - The impact of persuasive communications on the individual has received considerable attention from a broad

              
spectrum of researchers. Hundreds of studies have attempted to model and monitor the effects of persuasive communications, yet relatively little is actually known about the nature of the communication process (Fishbein and Ajzen 1972). Recently a number of researchers (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975; Lutz and Swasy 1977; Wright 1980)...
