T1  - “This Time It’s Different” Preparing for Release Through a Prison-Model of CoSA: A Phenomenological and Repertory Grid Analysis
AN  - 2290056967
AB  - Circles of support and accountability (CoSA) in the prison-model begin prior to the core members’ release from prison and continue with them on release in to the community. The purpose of this study was to explore the expectations of release of those convicted of a sexual offense and how this develops during their participation in the prison sessions of CoSA. The research question was to consider how the prison-model of CoSA relates to the desistance of crime, in particular the phases of desistance developed by Gobbels, Ward, and Willis. Data were collected using both phenomenological interviews and repertory grids at two different time points; prior to starting the circle in prison (n = 9) and just before release (n = 5). The findings suggest the prison sessions provide a sense of support and “no longer being alone” often absent in those who sexually offend. The additional prison sessions enabled the participants to experience this during their approaching release date; a stressful period that was characterized by anxiety. Further research is now required to explore whether circles in the prison-model are able to encourage and reinforce the cognitive change required for desistance, enabling the core members to successfully manage their underlying anxieties surrounding societal stigmatization.

T1  - Closing the researcher-practitioner gap
AN  - 2287886975
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which learning gained through participation in three research methods workshops funded by an Arts and Humanities Research Council networking grant was applied in practice.Design/methodology/approachData were collected by online survey and focus group from individuals who participated in the Developing Research Excellence and Methods (DREaM) project workshops in 2011/2012. The survey data were coded and analysed manually, as were the transcribed focus group discussions.FindingsFollowing the conclusion of the DREaM project the participants at the core of the network applied their learning from the workshops to innovate in the workplace and to develop information services, with evident impact on end-users of library and information services. The strongest impact of the DREaM project, however, was found in reports of widened opportunities for the researcher and practitioner cadre members, many of which arose from collaborations. This provides evidence of a second proven strategy (in addition to the provision of research reports in practitioner publications) for narrowing the library and information science (LIS) research-practice gap: the creation of researcher-practitioner networks.Research limitations/implicationsCollaborative interactions between academic researchers and practitioners bring benefits to both network participants themselves and to the wider communities with which they interact. These are likely to be applicable across a range of subject domains and geographies.Practical implicationsNetwork grants are valuable for furnishing learning that may be applied in practice, and for bridging the research-practice gap.Social implicationsIn LIS and other domains that suffer from a research-practice gap (e.g. teaching, social work, nursing, policing, management) the bringing together of researchers and practitioners in networks may address problems associated with misunderstandings between the two communities, and lead to improved services provision.Originality/valueThis study provides an evaluation of network development that goes beyond simply reporting changes in network topology. It does so by assessing the value that network relationships provide to individuals and groups, extending knowledge on mechanisms of collaborative interaction within research networks. It is also the first detailed study of the impact of a UK research council networking grant.

T1  - Value Co-Creation as a Dialectical Process: Study in Bangladesh and Indian Province of West Bengal
AN  - 2181776751
AB  - The process by which technological innovation is adopted and diffused within an industry persists as a key research interest in the existing literature. Furthermore, the innovation and diffusion of ICT (information and communications technology) in general and smartphones in particular are viewed as a useful resource to support and foster socio-economic wellbeing in developing countries. As such, sustainable design and development of smartphone industry in developing world and their contribution to socio-economic wellbeing has drawn significant research attention. In the current study, we explore and analyse various factors and their inter-relationships that initiate, support and disseminate technological innovation within the smartphone industry in Bangladesh and Indian province of West Bengal who share linguistic, historical and cultural ties. Drawing on the concept of co-creation of value we develop a dialectical perspective toward multi-stakeholder involvement in smartphone industry’s creation of value. Through in-depth interviews with senior government and private sector employees, industry experts, researchers, and small and medium enterprise owners, we conclude that the development of ancillary industries, contextually appropriate apps and innovation by small enterprises and inter-industry collaborations contribute to current and future innovation and sustainable development of smartphone industry.

T1  - Revisiting strategy mapping for performance management: a realist synthesis
AN  - 2237461398
AB  - PurposeThe strategy map represents a major contribution to the theory and practice of performance management. However, it has failed to realize its full potential due to a lack of theoretical and conceptual development. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to revisit the theories of strategy maps to better understand how and in what circumstances they benefit performance management.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs realist synthesis, a method of systematic literature review. A theory on how strategy maps work is extracted from performance management literature, which are subsequently evaluated through a critical examination of empirical studies.FindingsA theory of how strategy maps are meant work is presented in relation to the generic performance management stages of problem structuring, development and use, where they can serve as a tool for discovery and by stimulating social interactions. Based on the findings, 12 propositions are offered related to the effective use of strategy maps within a performance management framework.Research limitations/implicationsThe introduction of the strategy map to performance management represented a breakthrough in how organizational performance could be understood and communicated. This study goes a step further by considering how they work and in what circumstances. In so doing, the study aims to open the way for new and more effective applications of strategy maps within the changing performance management context.Practical implicationsThis study provides practitioners with actionable propositions which can help in effectively using strategy maps.Originality/valueDistinguishing the aims and mechanisms of the strategy map along performance management systems has the potential to greatly increase their effectiveness in practice as a powerful, but underutilized tool. This paper also demonstrates how realist synthesis, currently an uncommon method in management studies, facilitated the creation of a new perspective of strategy maps to fit specifically within performance management.

AN  - 2229511123
AB  - Stress, burnout, and professional impairment are prevalent among mental health professionals and can have a negative impact on their clinical work, whilst engagement in self-care can help promote therapist well-being. This literature review examines the role of self-care in the promotion of well-being among mental health practitioners. Specifically, empirical research is presented in relation to specific domains of self-care practice, including awareness, balance, flexibility, physical health, social support, and spirituality. Findings from this review underscore the importance of taking a proactive approach to self-care and, in particular, integrating self-care directly into clinical training programs and into the quality assurance processes of professional organizations within the field of mental health.

T1  - Effective customer journey design: consumers’ conception, measurement, and consequences
AN  - 2164400368
AB  - Recently, practitioners have begun appraising an effective customer journey design (CJD) as an important source of customer value in increasingly complex and digitalized consumer markets. Research, however, has neither investigated what constitutes the effectiveness of CJD from a consumer perspective nor empirically tested how it affects important variables of consumer behavior. The authors define an effective CJD as the extent to which consumers perceive multiple brand-owned touchpoints as designed in a thematically cohesive, consistent, and context-sensitive way. Analyzing consumer data from studies in two countries (4814 consumers in total), they provide evidence of the positive influence of an effective CJD on customer loyalty through brand attitude—over and above the effects of brand experience. Importantly, an effective CJD more strongly influences utilitarian brand attitudes, while brand experience more strongly affects hedonic brand attitudes. These underlying mechanisms are also prevalent when testing for the contingency factors services versus goods, perceived switching costs, and brand involvement.

T1  - Exploring Systemic Problems in IS Adoption Using Critical Systems Heuristics
AN  - 2103352964
AB  - Most of the traditional technology acceptance models revolve around information systems (IS)/information technology (IT) adoption at individual user level. Organizations are complex social systems in which stakeholders interact and play different roles in IS/IT adoption and use. This study provides an organizational perspective through multiple stakeholder viewpoints to explore ‘systemic problems’ in IS adoption. This paper contributes to IS literature by applying boundary critique mechanism of Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) through an interpretive study of a web portal implementation project in a West Australian University. This perspective considers systemic problems as a ‘system of conflicts’ comprising key factors and organization-wide stakeholder interactions. Moreover, it adds to CSH theory as to how systemic problems are identified by using boundary judgments and evaluated using a hermeneutic approach.

T1  - Incorporating visual methods in longitudinal transformative service research
AN  - 2089837852
AB  - PurposeConsumer experiences of healthcare services are challenging for researchers to study because of the complex, intangible and temporal nature of service provision. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel longitudinal three-phase research protocol, which combines iterative interviewing with visual techniques. This approach is utilised to study consumer service experiences, dimensions of consumer value and consumer value co-creation in a transformational service setting: complementary and alternative medicine healthcare.Design/methodology/approachThis research employed a three-phase qualitative longitudinal research protocol, which incorporated: an initial in-depth interview, implementation of the visual elicitation technique Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique and a final interview to gain participant feedback on the analysis of data collected in the first two phases.FindingsFour key benefits derived from using the three-phase protocol are reported: confirmation and elaboration of consumer value themes, emergence of underreported themes, evidence of transformation and refinement of themes, ensuring dependability of data and subsequent theory development.Originality/valueThe study provides evidence that a longitudinal multi-method approach using in-depth interviews and visual methods is a powerful tool that service researchers should consider, particularly for transformative service research settings with sensitive contexts, such as healthcare, and when studying difficult to articulate concepts, such as consumer value and value co-creation.

T1  - Appropriating Video Surveillance for Art and Environmental Awareness: Experiences from ARTiVIS
AN  - 2045938271
AB  - Arts, Real-Time Video and Interactivity for Sustainability (ARTiVIS) is an ongoing collaborative research project investigating how real-time video, DIY surveillance technologies and sensor data can be used as a tool for environmental awareness, activism and artistic explorations. The project consists of a series of digital contexts for aesthetic contemplation of nature and civic engagement, aiming to foster awareness and empowerment of local populations through DIY surveillance. At the core of the ARTIVIS efforts are a series of interactive installations (namely B-Wind!, Hug@tree and Play with Fire), that make use of surveillance technologies and real-time video as raw material to promote environmental awareness through the emotion generated by real-time connections with nature. Throughout the project development, the surveillance concept has been shifting from the use of surveillance technology in a centralized platform, to the idea of veillance with distributed peer-to-peer networks that can be used for science and environmental monitoring. In this paper we present the history of the ARTiVIS project, related and inspiring work, describe ongoing research work and explore the present and future challenges of appropriating surveillance technology for artistic, educational and civic engagement purposes.

T1  - Entrepreneurial resilience: a biographical analysis of successful entrepreneurs
AN  - 2042612150
AB  - To be sustainably successful, entrepreneurs need a resilience capacity that enables them to overcome critical situations and even emerge from failures and crises stronger than before. Although academic interest in the resilience concept has steadily grown in recent years, research on entrepreneurial resilience is still at a preliminary stage. It largely remains unclear what entrepreneurial resilience actually is, which elements it contains, and how it can be enhanced. To help filling this research gap, we provide a literature review and deduce a theoretical framework of entrepreneurial resilience. Furthermore, we analyze the biographies of eight highly resilient entrepreneurs. Based on a qualitative content analysis, we identify two situational (parents’ behavior and parents’ experience) and two process-related factors (entrepreneurial learning and experience and entrepreneur’s work attitudes and behaviors) that seem to have a great impact on the development of entrepreneurial resilience and success. As a result, our paper offers a useful starting point for future empirical studies and a successful management of resilience in the entrepreneurial context.

AB  - O crescimento do uso das Tecnologias da Informação Móveis e Sem Fio (TIMS) nas organizações tem viabilizado cada vez mais o trabalho móvel, trazendo tanto benefícios quanto desafios aos processos de trabalho. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi compreender quais são os paradoxos vivenciados com o uso de TIMS na tomada de decisão individual em contexto de mobilidade. Foi realizada uma pesquisa qualitativa por meio de um grupo focal e entrevistas semiestruturadas, com um total de 26 participantes (executivos e gestores de nível intermediário) que tomam decisões nesse contexto. Os resultados corroboram paradoxos já identificados na literatura, e que se manifestam nos processos de tomada de decisão em contexto de mobilidade: Ocupado e Disponível, Planejamento e Improvisação, Engajamento e Desengajamento, Competência e Incompetência. Além disso, novos paradoxos foram identificados: Pessoal e Profissional, Maior Colaboração e Menos Face a Face, Decisões mais Ágeis e Decisões com Maior Exposição ao Erro.Alternate abstract:The growth in the use of Mobile and Wireless Information Technology (MWIT) in organizations has increasingly enabled mobile work, bringing both benefits and challenges to work processes.

T1  - Shifts in Online Consumer Behavior: A Preliminary Investigation of the Net Generation
AN  - 2036395522
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to examine the factors affecting the online shopping behavior of Netgeneration comparing with pre Net-generation. To do so, the research develops a research model including nine independent variables that are hypothesized to predict the intention of purchase using the online shopping context and Net-geners' characteristics. The partial least squares method of structural equation modeling was used to analyze 293 Net-geners and 246 preNet-geners. The results of the study show that the six online purchase determinants (product variety, feedback, responsiveness, personalization, acceptance of complaints, and enjoyment) are more important for Net-geners than for preNet-geners. This study contributes to the understanding of online purchasing behavior of the Net generation (Net-geners) and will help to envision new strategies for marketing to Net-geners. Previous research has focused on shifts in technology and overlooks the shift of consumer demographics as the Net-geners are the first to grow up surrounded by digital media and the Internet.

T1  - Can copycat private labels improve the consumer's shopping experience? A fluency explanation
AN  - 1905129858
AB  - A top priority among retailers is enhancing the consumer's shopping experience. With the number of private label products increasing at the same time retailers are shedding slower moving products, understanding how private labels impact the consumer's experience at the retail shelf becomes critical. While one might think that private labels, in particular those that look similar to their national brand counterparts (i.e., copycat private labels), may hinder the shopping experience by making it more difficult for consumers to choose a product, we find the exact opposite. Adopting a fluency perspective, we show that when copycat private labels are included in a shelf set, consumers with high knowledge of the category experience greater choice ease, and as a result they subsequently evaluate their chosen product more favorably. Importantly, the choice ease and evaluations of novice consumers are found to be unaffected. Consequently, this research provides insights for retailers and manufacturers on how and why copycat private labels positively impact an important aspect of the consumer's shopping experience (i.e., choice ease).

T1  - A comprehensive hierarchical model of retail banking
AN  - 1898608339
AB  - Purpose 
The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a comprehensive hierarchical model of behavioural intentions in the Malaysian retail banking industry. 
Design/methodology/approach 
The data were analysed using EFA, CFA and structural modelling. 
Findings 
The findings illustrate that customer satisfaction is the most important determinant of behavioural intentions, followed by switching costs, corporate image and perceived value. Service quality is indirectly related to behavioural intentions and customer satisfaction mediates the relationship between the two constructs. Customer satisfaction is strongly influenced by service quality, corporate image and perceived value. Service quality is also an antecedent of perceived value, corporate image and switching costs. The empirical results also support a hierarchical and multidimensional approach for conceptualising and measuring customers' perceptions of service quality. 
Research limitations/implications 
The comprehensive hierarchical model developed in this research can be used as framework for additional studies on the banking industry. 
Practical implications 
The findings provide Malaysian bank managers with empirically-based insights into behavioural intentions and offer guidelines for assessing and improving service quality. 
Originality/value 
This is the first study that uses comprehensive hierarchical modelling to synthesise the effects of service quality, customer satisfaction, perceived value, corporate image and switching costs on the behavioural intentions of retail bank customers.

T1  - Shared Consumer Needs Across India and China: A Path to Global Advertising of Services?
AN  - 1905129804
AB  - Global advertising often uses cultural values to standardize globally advertised messages. However, this exploratory study investigates the possibility that rather than cultural values (and consumer wants), it is consumer needs that are strongly shared across countries. Therefore, it might be possible to replace cultural values with these shared consumer needs for the standardization of globally advertised messages. This study does not argue against the universality of the content or structure of values, but rather against the universality of the importance of values across countries. The means-end theory is used to link the relationships between consumer wants, needs, and values. Data collected from Indian and Chinese consumers of information technology education services were analyzed using the laddering technique to reveal hierarchical value maps for each of the two country samples. The results indicate that at the level of consumer wants, Indian consumers seek more tangible attributes while Chinese consumers seek more intangible ones. Also, at the level of cultural values, Chinese consumers associate more values with the service than their Indian counterparts. At the same time, within both groups of consumers the same set of consumer needs were strongly shared among consumers; these were the need for knowledge enhancement, the need for skill improvement, and the need for better employability. Therefore, the results suggest that if managers want to successfully standardize their global advertising, their message strategy could focus on consumer needs that are strongly shared across countries.

T1  - A systematic review of research on psychiatric mother-baby units
AN  - 1899818415
AB  - Psychiatric mother-baby units (MBUs) are currently viewed as best practice, particularly in the UK, Australia and France, for improving outcomes for mothers and babies when the former are experiencing severe forms of mental illness. A growing number of publications have examined MBUs, but to date, there has not been a comprehensive review of these studies. As such, the systematic review reported in this paper sought to address this gap. A systematic search was conducted for peer-reviewed research and grey literature published in English between 2000 and 2015. A final sample of 44 publications were identified that reported on empirical findings with regard to MBUs. Three quarters of the studies focused on individual MBUs and most studies were quantitative. A thematic analysis of the studies identified three major themes: (1) admissions data, (2) outcomes for mothers, and (3) programmes and interventions. The analysis also identified four secondary themes: (i) follow-up after discharge, (ii) separation of mothers and babies after discharge, (iii) client satisfaction with MBUs, and (iv) partners of women admitted to MBUs. The findings of the review highlight gaps in knowledge about MBUs and provide suggestions for future research.

T1  - Strategic B2B customer experience management: the importance of outcomes-based measures
AN  - 1890809280
AB  - Purpose              The purpose of this paper is to critique the adequacy of efforts to capture the complexities of customer experience in a business-to-business (B2B) context using input-output measures. The paper introduces a strategic customer experience management framework to capture the complexity of B2B service interactions and discusses the value of outcomes-based measurement.              Design/methodology/approach              This is a theoretical paper that reviews extant literature related to B2B customer experience and asks fresh questions regarding B2B customer experience at a more strategic network level.              Findings              The paper offers a reconceptualisation of B2B customer experience, proposes a strategic customer experience management framework and outlines a future research agenda.              Research limitations/implications              This paper is conceptual and seeks to raise questions surrounding the under-examined area of B2B customer experience. As a consequence, it has inevitable limitations resulting from the lack of empirical evidence to support the reconceptualisation.              Practical implications              Existing measures of customer experience are problematic when applied in a B2B (services) context. Rather than adopting input- and output-based measures, widely used in a business-to-consumer (B2C) context, a B2B context requires a more strategic approach to capturing and managing customer experience. Focussing on strategically important issues should generate opportunities for value co-creation and are more likely to involve outcomes-based measures.              Social implications              Improving the understanding of customer experience in a B2B context should allow organisations to design better services and consequently enhance the experiences of their employees, their customers and other connected actors.              Originality/value              This paper critiques the current approach to measuring customer experience in a B2B context, drawing on contemporary ideas of value-in-use, outcomes-based measures and "Big Data" to offer potential solutions to the measurement problems identified.

T1  - Measuring brand experiences cross-nationally
AN  - 1878002362
AB  - The need for reliable and valid metrics for tracking consumers’ experiences of products and brands cross-nationally is becoming ever more important as companies are increasingly operating in international markets. Brand experiences associated with global brands can manifest themselves very differently in different parts of the world; thus, the scales developed to track brand experiences should be validated cross-nationally. This research tests and revises an existing brand experience measurement scale cross-nationally in two countries that have very different cultural settings. Based on the findings from a survey with a sample of 1008 respondents, the authors propose a revised and shortened scale that provides more reliable and valid measurement results of brand experiences of global high-tech brands. In general, the results demonstrate the need for tests on the cross-national applicability of measurement scales and, even further, they underline the importance of replication research.

T1  - Theorising strategic investment decision-making using strong structuration theory
AN  - 1826443097
AB  - PurposeIn the field of strategic investment decision making (SIDM) a body of research has grown up via international case studies and organisation-based fieldwork. However, there has been little systematic theorisation around SIDM processes and practices. The purpose of this paper is to show how strong structuration theory (SST) can be employed to guide how future SIDM studies are conducted and theorised.Design/methodology/approachThe authors draw upon the concepts from SST to reanalyse prior empirically based work. The authors apply SST-informed analysis to four SIDM case studies selected from the total of 18 published over the period 1970-2016 to explore the utility of SST compared with other approaches.FindingsThe analysis highlights the role of agents’ knowledgeability and position-practice relations in SIDM, which has largely been neglected by prior studies. The authors demonstrate the potential of SST to inform meso-level theorising by applying it to four published case studies. Whilst the authors argue for the adoption of SST, the authors also identify key methodological and conceptual issues in using SST in SIDM research.Research limitations/implicationsThe examples and recommendations could assist management accounting researchers, particularly those engaged in case studies and organisational fieldwork, to build knowledge via the improved comparison, integration and theorisation of cases undertaken by different researchers in different contexts.Originality/valueThe authors offer a bridge between SST concepts and case study evidence for theorising, carrying out and analysing case study and field research on SIDM.

T1  - A persuasive-based latent class segmentation analysis of luxury brand websites
AN  - 1813565135
AB  - Based on the development of the use of websites by brands, the purpose of this paper is to identify and describe different groups of luxury brands bearing in mind the persuasiveness of their websites (informativeness, usability, credibility, inspiration, involvement and reciprocity). The data for this study were collected from 197 luxury websites through content analysis methodology. Then, latent class cluster analysis was employed to identify the segments obtained in this study. The results confirm the existence of three segments of luxury brands according to website persuasiveness: "exclusive websites", "transparent and accessible websites" and "old-fashioned websites". This study helps luxury brand managers to evaluate the degree of persuasiveness of each group, determines how attractive the websites in each group are and suggests the measures necessary to improve their websites.

T1  - Perceived managerial and leadership effectiveness in a Korean context: An indigenous qualitative study: APJM APJM
AN  - 1812699197
AB  - The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study is to identify what Korean managers and non-managerial employees perceive to be effective or ineffective managerial behaviors from an emic perspective. Critical incident technique was used to collect concrete examples from 45 managers and non-managerial employees of observed managerial behaviors that they perceived as effective and ineffective. While the emphasis was given to both effective and ineffective managerial behaviors with a holistic approach, 38 distinctive behavioral categories of effective and ineffective managerial behavior were derived. Furthermore, the seven overarching indigenous themes of Korean managerial behavior emerged, offering an insightful, contextually relevant, and richly described understanding of perceived managerial and leadership effectiveness in a Korean context. The authors identified and described several Korean cultural concepts embedded in the indigenous themes, which may confirm implicit leadership theory. After discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings, the authors provide the limitations of this study and several directions for future research. As one of the first attempts at identifying indigenous Korean managerial and leadership effectiveness, this study could become a cornerstone for advanced indigenous empirical studies and a catalyst for dialogue related to indigenous managerial and leadership research, especially in Korean and other East Asian contexts.

AN  - 1869477656
AB  - Written largely from a UK perspective, this paper presents a review of the literature regarding the nature of minority writing in the English language, and its supply, promotion and readership. Following an initial exploration of the diverse terminology used to describe such fiction, the main body of the review is structured according to the five potential elements of the minority ethnic fiction supply chain - the author, the book trade, the library supplier, the public library, the reader - with an attempt to bring together the principal academic and professional texts published on each subject. This paper has raised two main issues of concern: firstly, that very little empirical research has been conducted into minority ethnic fiction - in particular regarding its readership, and secondly, that previous research has tended to focus on linguistic aspects of minority ethnic fiction stock provision and use, rather than on cultural aspects. Given the nature of the broader empirical research of which this review forms a part, the paper is almost entirely focused on English language fiction only. Reviews in this field have not previously tended to take into account all five elements of the minority ethnic fiction supply chain, or in particular the readership of such fiction. These previous omissions have been addressed in the present paper.

The popularity of the approach is mainly attributable to the ACs' numerous strengths, which include the perceived fairness, practical utility and strong associations with on-the-job performance. To maintain the integrity of the AC, it is important for practitioners and decision makers to apply the method in a consistent and standardised manner. The purpose of the report is to provide practitioners and decision makers with practical guidelines and concrete procedures when using ACs as part of the organisation's human resource management strategy. The past decade has seen significant advances in the science and practice of ACs. Now in its fifth edition, the revised Guidelines seek to provide important information to practitioners and decision makers on a number of factors when used in conjunction with the AC method, namely, technology, validation, legislation, ethics and culture. The Guidelines provide specific suggestions and recommendations for using technology as part of the manner of delivery. Issues of culture, diversity and representation are also discussed. New features of the Guidelines include more concrete guidance on how to conduct a validation study as well as unpacking several ethical dilemmas that practitioners may encounter. Of critical importance is a position statement on the use of ACs in relation to new legislation (Employment Equity Amendment Act, Section 8, clause d) pertaining to psychometric testing. The Guidelines serve as a benchmark of best practice for practitioners and decision makers who intend on, or are currently, using ACs in their organisations. In the absence of formal standards governing the use of ACs in South Africa, the Guidelines provide an important step towards establishing standardisation in the use of the AC method. The Guidelines provide (1) guidance to industrial and organisational psychologists, organisational consultants, human resource management specialists, generalists and the Department of Labour, and others designing and conducting ACs; (2) information to managers deciding whether to introduce AC methods; (3) instructions to assessors taking part in the AC; (4) guidance on the use of technology and navigating diverse cultural contexts; and (5) a reference for professionals on best practice considerations in the use of the AC method.

T1  - Strategic Planning Objectives for Venture Capitalist Investments in Emerging Information Technologies: A Value-focused Perspective
AN  - 1756103491
AB  - Academic and practitioner literature suggests that Venture Capitalists often have problems with aligning information technology opportunities with investment objectives. To a large extent the alignment process is not formally documented and relies on intuitive instincts. Hence it is important to define Venture Capitalist objectives for investments in emerging information technologies. This paper uses the Value-Focused Thinking approach to identify, define and structure value driven objectives. Based on data collected from a number of Venture Capitalist interviews we identified 130 values, which resulted in 72 objectives. These objectives were organized into 22 clusters, which were bifurcated into fundamental and means categories. In a final synthesis we present a 7 fundamental and 15 means categorical objectives for strategically planning Venture Capitalist investments in emerging information technologies.

T1  - The appraisal profiles of amazement: Exploring the appraisal components of the emotion of amazement
AN  - 1761794380
AB  - Research on amazement is surprisingly thin. This research proposes amazement to be an emotional state that is associated with a set of appraisal dimensions distinct from those of related emotions, in particular, amusement, awe, confusion and surprise. Specifically, amazement was hypothesized to be positively associated with, unexpectedness, pleasantness, personal relevance, thought-provokingness, grandness and negatively associated with understandability. In the first study, participants recalled and described an individual experience of amazement, amusement, awe, confusion and surprise, and rated their appraisals based on their experiences. The second study employed an event sampling methodology in which participants reported their emotions and appraisals on different occasions in real-time. The predicted appraisals of amazement were largely supported and were also found to be significantly different from those of amusement, awe, confusion and surprise. Characteristics and evolutionary functions of amazement were also discussed.

T1  - The attitudes of Thai hosts towards western volunteer tourists
AN  - 1732757638
AB  - This study examines the attitudes of Thai hosts towards Western volunteer tourists who were on volunteer vacation at the Home and Life orphanage. An interpretive paradigm utilising a combination of qualitative data collection methods (semi-structured, in-depth interviews and participant observation) was conducted with twenty resident members of Thai Muang sub-district who acted as the host of the volunteer tourists. The analysis of the data revealed that all respondents portrayed positive attitudes towards volunteer tourists, based upon two main factors: the volunteer tourists' conduct and performance; and the perceived benefits they gained from the work of these tourists. The opportunity for the local children to learn English with English native speakers was cited as the most significant benefit. However, the respondents also had concerns about some aspects of the volunteer tourists' behaviour and perceived under -performance, which was found to be mainly the result of cultural differences. In addition, it was found that there are mixed views regarding the volunteer tourists: some respondents perceived them as special type of tourist, whereas some viewed them as being non-tourists.

T1  - Segmenting consumers’ reasons for and against ethical consumption
AN  - 2085632333
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to quantify the relative importance of reasons used to explain consumers’ selection and rejection of ethical products, accounting for differences in ethical orientations across consumers. Design/methodology/approach – Reviewing previous literature and drawing on in-depth interviews, a taxonomy of reasons for and against ethical purchasing is developed. An online survey incorporating best–worst scaling (BWS) determines which reasons feature more in shaping ethical consumerism. Cluster analysis and multinomial regression are used to identify and profile segments. Findings – Positively orientated consumers (42 per cent of respondents) purchase ethical products more so because of reasons relating to impact, health, personal relevance, and quality. Negatively orientated consumers (34 per cent of respondents) reject ethical alternatives based on reasons relating to indifference, expense, confusion and scepticism. A third segment is ambivalent in their behaviour and reasoning; they perceive ethical purchasing to be effective and relevant, but are confused and sceptical under what conditions this can occur. Research limitations/implications – Preferences were elicited using an online survey rather than using real market data. Though the task instructions and methods used attempted to minimise social-desirability bias, the experiment might still be subject to its effects. Practical implications – Competitive positioning strategies can be better designed knowing which barriers to ethical purchasing are more relevant. The paper challenges the benefits in altruistic-based positioning and outlines shortcomings in communication about ethical products, including those relating to product labelling. Social implications – Through their purchase behaviours across a number of categories, ethical consumers aim to minimise the harm and exploitation of humans, animals and the natural environment. This research provides insights into the potential reasons why the uptake of ethical products is not being achieved and how it can be addressed to make improvements in making this movement more mainstream. Originality/value – This research examines an extensive list of reasons for and against ethical purchasing used by a general population of consumers. By forcing respondents to make trade-offs, this is the first study quantifying the relative importance of reasons utilised by consumers. It also highlights the value in using cluster analysis on best–worst scores to identify underlying segments.

T1  - Stakeholder management in value-based software development: systematic review
AN  - 1610049580
AB  - In the value-based software (VBS) development, an innovative idea is realised in order to gain an economic leverage. The VBS systems deal with financial streams and this thing make them different from the conventional systems. The valuable requirements can only be gathered from the success critical stakeholders. To select a set of success critical stakeholders, different stakeholders identification and quantification (SIQ) approaches are presented by the researchers. The current approaches cannot be adopted as a standard, as different methods and processes are adopted in different approaches. In this study, the aim is to find out the reported evidence based on attributes or characteristics of the stakeholders and their usage context in terms of their application in different domains, stakeholders' quantification metrics, the reported stakeholder types and the reported issues of VBS development. The stakeholders' metrics can be derived by using the stakeholders' attributes and a new SIQ framework can be proposed for the VBS systems.

T1  - The Influences of Online Service Technologies and Task Complexity on Efficiency and Personalization
AN  - 1540458072
AB  - Online retailers are increasingly providing service technologies, such as technology-based and human-based services, to assist customers with their shopping. Despite the prevalence of these service technologies and the scholarly recognition of their importance, surprisingly little empirical research has examined the fundamental differences among them. In this paper, the authors propose the Model of Online Service Technologies (MOST) to theorize that the capacity of a service provider to accommodate the variability of customer inputs into the service process is the key difference among various types of service technologies. They posit two types of input variability: Service Provider-Elicited Variability (SPEV), where variability is determined in advance by the service provider; and User-Initiated Variability (UIV), where customers determine variability in the service process. The findings reveal that SPEV technologies are more efficient, but less personalized, than SPEUIV technologies. However, when task complexity is high (vs. low), the superior efficiency of SPEV technologies is less prominent, while both SPEV and SPEUIV technologies have higher personalization.

T1  - Evaluating the Identity of Program Recipients Using an Identity Exploration Instrument
AN  - 1648334823
AB  - This article argues that the self and identity of program recipients should be an important variable in program evaluations. In a smoking cessation program, for example, the aim should be to achieve a change in the way recipients view themselves and their identity as smokers or nonsmokers. The article identifies a gap in published studies that consider self and identity as an outcome or process measure in program evaluation. The potential of such an approach to give added depth to program evaluation is considered. Three studies in this area are identified and summarized: the identity of parents aft er child death; the professional identity of students aft er a program of interprofessional education; and the characteristics of male identity in Germany. To identify possible approaches, conceptualizations of self and identity and methods of exploring and measuring it are considered, culminating in the identification and description of a synthetic theory of identity, Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), and its associated measuring tool, Ipseus. The choice of this method as part of a program evaluation is justified. The use of ISA/Ipseus in three program evaluations?decision-making in community safety; student constructions of theory and practice in nurse education; and demands and tensions in nursing lecturing?is described. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are considered.

T1  - The role of learning in value co-creation in new technological B2B services
AN  - 1512602055
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to explore the role of learning in value co-creation in the context of new technological B2B services. The research objective is approached from the customers' viewpoint, in terms of their motivation to make sacrifices in learning and to embark on value co-creation with a service provider. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a qualitative case study. The main source of data is 17 interviews with retailers who tested a new m-advertising service. Findings - The findings show that the customer's motives to make sacrifices, their absorptive capacity and exploitative/explorative learning orientation are important in explaining the role of learning in value co-creation, because perceived value can vary significantly depending on the level of the absorptive capacity of the firm, the orientation towards learning, and the customer's sacrifices in learning. Practical implications - The study can be of use to providers of new technological business services in showing how to persuade customers to learn to use the service and engage in value co-creation. This is important since the active participation of both actors is required to co-produce the technological B2B service. Originality/value - The study contributes to the existing value theory by offering new critical insights into the essential role of customer learning in value co-creation. Closely related to this, the study explores customer motivation to make sacrifices in learning and to get involved in value co-creation with service provider, specifically in the context of new technological B2B services. In so doing, this study offers empirically-based insights into value co-creation and thus advances the current understanding of value phenomena.

T1  - Resilience and Business Performance in the U.S. Supply Chain
AN  - 1620743379
AB  - Disruption to the supply chain can have significant economic effects on companies and the economy. Managers may be unclear as to which supply chain management strategies would best improve performance to increase resilience against disruptions and would benefit from information leading to optimal solutions. In this study, the research questions focused on the relationship between resilience and financial performance for U.S. supply chain companies. Based on the rational choice theory and supply chain investment principles, a correlational study was conducted using secondary financial information from 300 companies in the U.S. supply chain. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was statistically significant and negative. High variability in days of inventory and cash-to-cash cycle, or low resilience, related to low levels of operating margin and return on investment ratios, or low performance. Knowledge of the positive relationship between resilience and performance may encourage managers to invest in resilience programs, and increased resilience could stimulate positive social change through lower costs of goods to consumers and reduced risk from harmful economic effects from supply chain disruptions. Further research is needed to define financial metrics for resilience.

T1  - Understanding Patients’ Adherence-Related Beliefs about Medicines Prescribed for Long-Term Conditions: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Necessity-Concerns Framework
AN  - 1463094721
AB  - Background 
Patients’ beliefs about treatment influence treatment engagement and adherence. The Necessity-Concerns Framework postulates that adherence is influenced by implicit judgements of personal need for the treatment (necessity beliefs) and concerns about the potential adverse consequences of taking it.
 Objective 
To assess the utility of the NCF in explaining nonadherence to prescribed medicines.
 Data sources 
We searched EMBASE, Medline, PsycInfo, CDSR/DARE/CCT and CINAHL from January 1999 to April 2013 and handsearched reference sections from relevant articles.
 Study eligibility criteria 
Studies using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) to examine perceptions of personal necessity for medication and concerns about potential adverse effects, in relation to a measure of adherence to medication.
 Participants 
Patients with long-term conditions.
 Study appraisal and synthesis methods 
Systematic review and meta-analysis of methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. We pooled odds ratios for adherence using random effects models.
 Results 
We identified 3777 studies, of which 94 (N = 25,072) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Across studies, higher adherence was associated with stronger perceptions of necessity of treatment, OR = 1.742, 95% CI [1.569, 1.934], p<0.0001, and fewer Concerns about treatment, OR = 0.504, 95% CI: [0.450, 0.564], p<0.0001. These relationships remained significant when data were stratified by study size, the country in which the research was conducted and the type of adherence measure used.
 Limitations 
Few prospective longitudinal studies using objective adherence measures were identified.
 Conclusions 
The Necessity-Concerns Framework is a useful conceptual model for understanding patients’ perspectives on prescribed medicines. Taking account of patients’ necessity beliefs and concerns could enhance the quality of prescribing by helping clinicians to engage patients in treatment decisions and support optimal adherence to appropriate prescriptions.

T1  - Spreading the word through likes on Facebook: Evaluating the message strategy effectiveness of Fortune 500 companies An International Journal
AN  - 1462482476
AB  - Purpose - This research aims to investigate the message strategies most likely to promote online "word-of-mouth" (WOM) activity for business-to-business (B2B)/business-to-consumer as well as product/service Facebook accounts. Design/methodology/approach - Using content analysis and HLM, the authors measure the relationship between three types of message strategies and Facebook message "Likes" by analyzing 1,143 wall post messages of 193 Fortune 500 Facebook accounts. Findings - Research findings suggest that B2B Facebook account posts are more effective if they include corporate brand names and avoid "hard sell" or explicitly commercial statements. Furthermore, results suggest that including emotional sentiments in Facebook posts is a particularly effective social media strategy for B2B and service marketers. Originality/value - This study advances the knowledge of social media and online WOM behavior, as well as B2B and service advertising/communication literature, by relating message content to message popularity. In terms of managerial implications, this research provides explanations and support for the implementation of effective social media message strategies that are likely to promote WOM activity.

T1  - The case of Amazon.com: towards a conceptual framework of online customer service experience (OCSE) using the emerging consensus technique (ECT)
AN  - 1432228652
AB  - Purpose - The concept of online customer service experience (OCSE) has recently received great interest from academia and businesses alike. Despite the belief that providing superb online experiences will influence customers' online buying behavior, most of the research focuses solely on the controllable factors of the online experience. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Using the means-end approach in 62 semi-structured interviews with a representative sample from three countries, and a new tool to elicit behavioral aggregation, the emerging consensus technique (ECT), the author conceptualizes online customer service experience (OCSE). Findings - The study identifies functionality and psychological factors as the two main dimensions of online customer service experience. Functionality encompasses the technical attributes of the web vendor, namely the sub-dimensions usability, product presence, communication, social presence, and interactivity. Psychological factors consist of the attitudinal based sub-dimensions context familiarity, trust, and value for money. The conceptual model extends and expands existing literature on online customer service experience models. In particular, the study identifies that the individual importance of the online customer service experience dimensions differ depending on which stage of the experience, namely prior to, during, or after the transaction the customer is in. Moreover, the study reveals the presence of one previously unexplored key component of the online customer service experience: social presence. Originality/value - Based on its empirical findings, this article proposes a dynamic conceptual framework of online customer service experience, which incorporates the individual dimensions of the online experience according to the stage of the customer journey. Using and validating a new tool of extracting elicit behavioral aggregation, the ECT, the study conceptualizes the online customer service experience, exploring previously unexplored key dimensions of OCSE. The model highlights the dynamic nature of OCSE by exploring the relative importance of each identified dimension in relation to the stage of the interaction, i.e. before, during, or after the transaction/purchase, between the customer and the service provider.

T1  - Essentials of psychoanalytic process and change: how can we investigate the neural effects of psychodynamic psychotherapy in individualized neuro-imaging?
AN  - 2292931662
AB  - The paper focuses on the essentials of psychoanalytic process and change and the question of how the neural correlates and mechanisms of psychodynamic psychotherapy can be investigated. The psychoanalytic approach aims at enabling the patient to “remember, repeat and work through” concerning explicit memory. Moreover, the relationship between analyst and patient establishes a new affective configuration which enables a reconstruction of the implicit memory. If psychic change can be achieved it corresponds to neuronal transformation. Individualized neuro-imaging requires controlling and measuring of variables that must be defined. Two main methodological problems can be distinguished: The design problem addresses the issue of how to account for functionally related variables in an experimentally independent way. The translation problem raises the question of how to bridge the gaps between different levels of the concepts presupposed in individualized neuro-imaging (e.g. the personal level of the therapist and the client, the neural level of the brain). An overview of individualized paradigms, which have been used until now is given, including Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis (OPD-2) and the Maladaptive Interpersonal Patterns Q-Start (MIPQS). The development of a new paradigm that will be used in fMRI experiments, the “Interpersonal Relationship Picture Set” (IRPS), is described. Further perspectives and limitations of this new approach concerning the design and the translation problem are discussed.

T1  - Teaching reputational risk management in the supply chain
AN  - 1398150969
AB  - Purpose - In the supply chain context, professionals manage various risks that have the potential to disrupt supplies. Surprisingly, one kind of risk is often overlooked: reputational risk. It is critical to recognise the risk potential that impacts on the reputation of the organisation. Furthermore, managers require an appropriate tool set to control it. The present paper aims to have a twin focus: first, it will lay out the basic premises behind corporate reputation, reputational risk, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Second, the practical implications will be addressed that lead to a substantial teaching component. Design/methodology/approach - The present paper is based on two research stages. Initially, the authors adopted the "reflective practitioner" philosophy that aimed at discovering the common beliefs in practice that explain working processes and management thought. In particular, they explored the foundation of CSR, reputation and risk management with specialists in dedicated workshops (electronics, energy, life sciences, telecommunications and defence industries, located at different stages of the supply chain). To gain more insight, the authors subsequently conducted in-depth interviews in these topic areas with key informants. The combination allowed them methodological triangulation. Findings - Reputation can be created and controlled as soon as its nature is fully understood (Reputational Owner). Interestingly, it is a transceiving business phenomenon that crosses organizational boundaries. Spillover effects can thus be observed at all stages of the supply chain by mere business association (Reputational Borrower). Reputation can range from positive to negative extremes and needs to be managed. The results of the authors' exploratory work are presented as quotations to provide the substance of the current and relevant subject. Research limitations/implications - The present work is exploratory in nature. Quantitative research methods are now required to validate and substantiate the findings. Practical implications - CSR is a contemporary foundation to mitigate reputational risk throughout the supply chain. The authors outline the reputational risk factors in this context and the ways of managing those. Social implications - In the market place, reputation is a reflection of the supply chain offering (products, services), communication (promotion, PR), and action (behaviour and views expressed). Consumers adopt supply chain reputation as a yardstick when making purchase decisions. It is therefore critical to manage reputational risk in the supply chain and this paper outlines the cause and effect relationships that this topic entails in modern society. Originality/value - This paper discusses the importance of reputational risk in the supply chain. It also explains the ways it can be mitigated via CSR. This is the management baseline that adds tremendous value for theory builders and present and future managers. Having the education of Master students in mind, the authors outline three specific teaching units that bring the conceptual underpinnings alive in an interactive learning environment.

T1  - Website quality in government: Exploring the webmaster's perception and explanation of website quality
AN  - 1398011231
AB  - Purpose - The objective of this paper is to investigate how webmasters within government bodies explain quality of websites. Despite the central position for advancing the communication, bridging usability tests and design, there are surprisingly few studies on how webmasters perceive, experience and explain website quality or design issues. Design/methodology/approach - The authors' unit of analysis is webmasters from Norwegian web-award-winning organizations. Eight webmasters from four types of websites were interviewed. The websites were purposefully sampled, using the strategy of maximal variation sampling to maximize difference between the four types of websites. Findings - The findings reveal that issues concerning usability are found to be an important dimension of website quality. The authors' analysis of how webmasters explain website quality reveals substantial variance in explanation of website quality. Repeated keywords of website quality are mainly related to user-friendliness, effective website usage, content-related issues and accessibility (WAI-principles). Research limitations/implications - This study includes webmasters from award-winning websites. In upcoming research contributions, it would add to the richness of the study if webmasters from non-award-winning websites were included. Measurement of website quality and success is widely addressed within the research literature. This paper offers the opportunity to understand how practitioners (i.e. webmasters) facilitate for website quality, grounded in their perception and explanations of which quality aspects they found to be of importance. Practical implications - The website quality aspects identified in this paper can be used as insights for how to develop and improve the quality of websites with the public sector. Social implications - The overall digital enabled transformation of government appears to be guided by a rather heterogeneous set of quality standards. While a variance of quality standards might stimulate innovation in websites, it can also lead to a substantial difference in digital services provided to citizens. Thus, the authors' research stimulates the awareness of diversity of quality parameters and could have as an implication that national and international standards beyond accessibility standards are more explicitly shared and debated. Originality/value - The aim of this paper is to provide insights into website practitioners' (i.e. webmasters') perception and explanation of quality aspects in websites. Webmasters are important contributors to the quality of available websites, and it is of particular benefit to learn about their suggestions. Most studies tackle perception of website quality from a user's point of view, while the added knowledge in this paper is the webmaster's explanation.

The technique integrates two well-established methods in service marketing: sequential incident and laddering techniques. The data collected from 41 customers in a hotel and restaurant experience context illustrate that the method corresponds with the key themes of the proposed experience concept and experience formation process. Findings - Applying the proposed technique reveals first, the customer's cognitive and emotional responses to company stimuli. Second, the salient customer cognitions and emotions across several episodes of the service interaction process are identified. Third, the personal values which drive the customer's service experience are disclosed. Research limitations/implications - The empirical study is a first illustration of the proposed measurement approach in only one company based on a limited sample size. The methodological contributions and development opportunities for further applications are set out for different contexts and in combination with other methods. Practical implications - The proposed method integrates customer and company-related constructs. Therefore, the data collected can provide managers with guidelines for customer service experience design based on detailed customer feedback. Originality/value - The paper proposes an innovative measurement approach to customer service experiences which can support knowledge development in an important marketing area.

T1  - Dynamics of Collective Sensemaking and Social Structuring Action Nets: An Organizational Ethnography Within the Military Health System's Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury
AN  - 1346181198
AB  - Organizational perception and conception of interactions and relationships vary over time and space. This study focused on the capacity within and between healthcare organizations to collectively make sense of ambivalent and ambiguous environments in the context of social structuring actions (Czarniawska, 2008; Johnson, 2009; Weick, 1995). The purpose was to develop narrative frames from which a deeper understanding could be developed of how collective sensemaking is enacted through reciprocal and reflective interorganizational relationships during the final phases of an intended multiorganizational integration endeavor (Barki & Pinsonneault, 2005; Oliver, 1990). This study explored and described collective sensemaking as recognizable patterned social structuring actions that surfaced during integration efforts within the Military Health System's Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury.      A narrative approach illustrated emergent social processes. In the process of collaboration, ongoing generative conversations (Taylor & Van Every, 2000; Hardy, Lawrence, & Grant, 2005; Weick, 2004) affected the relationships between collective sensemaking and social structuring. An interpretive constructionist perspective revealed practices involving the interplay of assignment of meaning (signification), reducing equivocality and integration; formation of a sense of community, establishing structures and norms  (legitimation); and the effects of collaboration and power  (domination) distribution (Giddens, 1984; Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005).     More than 24 months of embedded observation aided the researcher's awareness of ongoing narrative dynamics of collaborative actions setting the conditions for the emergence of interorganizational relationships (Harquail & King, 2010; Hatch, 1997; Hatch & Schultz, 2002) and embodied practices (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991). Throughout experiences of collective sensemaking, organizations interpose mini-narratives as evidence of reciprocal patterns of social structuring revealing cooperative behaviors interweaving coordinated actions and setting conditions for the structuring of collaborative integrating nets of collective action. This supports both Carniawska's (2008) and Weick's (1995) theory of organizing during collective sensemaking as enacted processes within relational conceptualizations and perceptions. These findings contribute to understanding the dynamics of collective sensemaking and social structuring; moreover, they incorporate the new paradigm of enaction (Kuhn, 1996; Stewart, Gapenne, & Di Paolo, 2010) as embodied sensemaking into organizational theory.

T1  - On the Importance of National Culture for the Design of Information Systems
AN  - 1197181873
AB  - In this contribution a literature review is conducted to illustrate how national culture influences phases of the design of information systems. For this purpose, we review the literature in order to identify reliable and commonly approved findings as well as still open remaining questions. Fundamentally, our literature review is a comprehensive framework that sets typical dimensions of system design as well as main types of cultural research in relation to each other. The existing research results in the area of national culture are classified along the levels of system design and attributed to typical phases of the design of information systems. It thus becomes apparent that in the domain of culture and information system design it is often only the design subject or the design object that is addressed. Contributions that connect both levels rarely exist. In our review, only a limited number of publications could be identified that covered concrete phases of the development providing system design, implementation, as well as verification and validation. From a theoretical perspective, there is an obvious dominance of Hofstede's cultural dimensions that well address single topics of the design, such as user interface and inter cultural problems in development teams. Other domains, however (e.g., technology and architecture), are inadequately explained. Further, a predominantly phenomenological focus becomes obvious. The observed cultural phenomena and the connected interpretations are usable in a limited way for concrete development initiatives. The contribution ends with the vision of a theory for the culturally sensitive design of socio-technical information systems that absorbs current scientific knowledge and unites it in a structured approach.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Online Customer Experience in e-Retailing: An empirical model of Antecedents and Outcomes
AN  - 1016517595
AB  - The empirical study tests and finds support for a comprehensive model of online customer experience (OCE).  OCE is composed of two experiential states: cognitive (CES) and affective (AES).  Perceived Control is a mediator between three antecedents: Connectedness, Customization, Ease of Use and AES.  Online customer satisfaction is a mediator between CES, AES and Repurchase Intention.  Online customer satisfaction has both a direct and indirect relationship with Repurchase Intention via Online Trust. The theoretical understanding of online shopping behavior has received much attention. Less focus has been given to the formation of the customer experience (CE) that results from online shopper interactions with e-retailers. This study develops and empirically tests a model of the relationship between antecedents and outcomes of online customer experience (OCE) within Internet shopping websites using an international sample. The study identifies and provides operational measures of these variables plus the cognitive and affective components of OCE. The paper makes contributions towards new knowledge and understanding of how e-retailers can provide effective online experiences for customers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Hidden assumptions and their influence on clinicians' acceptance of new IT systems in the NHS
AN  - 1013462338
AB  - Issue Title: Governance, Risk and Compliance in Information Systems

              
The UK National Health Service (NHS) is embarking on the largest investment programme in Information Technology (IT). The National Programme for IT (NPfIT) in the NHS is the biggest civil IT project in the world and seeks to revolutionise the way care is delivered, drive up quality and make more effective use of resources of the NHS. Despite these high expectations, the NHS has historically experienced some high profile IT failures and the sponsors of the programme admitted that there remain a number of critical barriers to the implementation of the programme. Clinicians' reluctance to accept new IT systems at a local level is seen to be a major factor in this respect. Focusing on such barriers, this paper reports research that explored and explained why such reluctance occurs in the NHS. The main contribution of this research derives from the distinctive approach based on Kelly's Personal Construct Theory (PCT) to understand the 'reluctance'. The argument presented in the paper indicates that such reluctance should be viewed not as deliberate resistance imposed by clinicians, but as their inability of changing their established group personal constructs related to ISDD activities. Therefore, this paper argues that the means that could occur to reduce the 'reluctance' are creative rather than corrective or normative. The research took place in a NHS Trust and the paper pays considerable attention to technological, behavioural and clinical perspectives that emerged from the study. The research was conducted as a case study in a NHS trust and data was collected from two local NHS IT project. The main research participants in this study were: (a) IT professionals including IT project managers and senior IT managers; and (b) senior clinicians.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Diversity and constructive conflict in stakeholder dialogue: considerations for design and methods
AN  - 922808868
AB  - Diversity is generally recognized as a key issue for learning in stakeholder dialogue on wicked sustainability issues. Yet the question on how design of stakeholder dialogue and supporting methods actually enhance learning in stakeholder dialogue deserves more attention. This paper presents constructive conflict as a central design issue for stakeholder dialogue. This means that a dialogue entails the articulation of a diversity of perspectives and the confrontation of claims and ideas based on these perspectives. Building on three properties of diversity (variety, balance and disparity), the methodological implications of constructive conflict as a central design issue will be derived. These implications are structured according to three design steps: stakeholder identification and selection, articulation of perspectives and confrontation of claims and ideas. It is argued that social scientific methods are needed to support design of stakeholder dialogue. Q methodology is presented as an example that was used in a stakeholder dialogue on sustainable biomass in the Netherlands to identify stakeholder perspectives, to select stakeholders and to structure the dialogue. The paper wraps up with conclusions on constructive conflict as a design issue.[ PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - EXQ: a multiple-item scale for assessing service experience
AN  - 926016823
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize, construct, refine and empirically validate a multiple-item scale for measuring customers' service experience (EXQ). Design/methodology/approach - The authors present exploratory research developing a conceptualization of service experience based on a two-stage approach: initial item generation through qualitative research, initial purification of these findings through exploratory factor analysis, and validation through the use of confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings - The paper conceptualizes and validates the concept of customer/service experience. In total, 19 items in four dimensions of the EXQ scale were identified: product experience, outcome focus, moments-of-truth and peace-of-mind. These dimensions reflect service experience perceptions. The findings support the conclusion that the service experience has a significant impact on customer satisfaction, loyalty and word-of-mouth intentions. The scale demonstrates good psychometric properties based on the variety of reliability and validity tests utilized and builds upon extant research. Practical implications - The research provides managers with the dimensions of service experience that influence purchase behavior and provides researchers with a sought-after conceptualization of service experience. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first empirically founded conceptualization and measurement of the service/customer experience.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF WEBSITE DESIGN DIMENSIONS ON INITIAL TRUST: A SYNTHESIS OF THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE
AN  - 914166186
AB  - This paper aims to provide an integrative review of the experiment-based literature on the antecedents of initial trust in a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce setting. To that end, we present a framework that classifies trust-inducing website features according to three broad dimensions, namely visual design, social cue design and content design, because comparing studies with different empirical set-ups requires conceptual clarity. To synthesize the literature we use an advanced vote-count procedure combined with a sign test. We find that the literature provides sound empirical support for our general hypothesis that web design cues effectively enhance consumers' initial trust towards unfamiliar online vendors. E-tailers should thus consider embedding human-like cues (i.e., facial photos, video streams) into their interfaces, as well as integrating assistive web applications (i.e., avatars, recommendation agents). Interestingly, we also find that internally provided e-assurance structures (such as privacy/security policies and vendor-specific guarantees) can be as effective as paid e-assurance mechanisms (such as third-party trust endorsements). Our overview also reveals that the effectiveness of certain trust-signalling features within the visual and social cue design dimensions is still under-researched. The support for the positive effect of such website atmospheric cues is therefore still weak. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Defining Usability: How Library Practice Differs from Published Research
AN  - 872342328
AB  - Library/information science professionals need a clearly articulated definition of usability/Web usability to implement intuitive websites. In this study, the authors analyzed usability definitions provided by the ARL library professionals and those found in the library/information science and computer science-information systems literature. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to identify similarities and differences between the attributes emphasized by the two sets of definitions based on information behavior models and human-computer interaction (HCI) frameworks. Results indicated that both groups overlooked critical usability elements, such as environment and information objects/content/resources. Thus, the authors proposed a working, multi-faceted definition that presents a holistic view of usability. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Improving knowledge capture during conceptual design phase of building projects
AN  - 919560477
AB  - Incomplete knowledge flow between architects and mechanical/electrical engineers engenders large expense and untimely delivery of building projects. It is essential to consider mechanical/electrical requirements from the early stages of design; and many experienced architects acknowledge this knowledge entities and the necessity for considering them at the right time. Therefore, inefficient knowledge flow among professionals during architectural conceptual design is emphasized as a problem for this study. For overcoming this problem, the study intends to improve knowledge capture during conceptual design phase of building projects by formalizing the fundamental requirements of necessary mechanical/electrical knowledge during this phase. To achieve this goal, this research develop three objectives: 1) Specify an appropriate knowledge capture technique for tacit dominated conceptual design phase; 2) Identify fundamental mechanical/electrical requirements to consider by architects during conceptual design phase; and 3) Develop a framework for formalizing tacit mechanical/electrical knowledge during conceptual design phase. Firstly, the study selects an appropriate technique to capture expert’s tacit knowledge based on a literature survey by matching existing knowledge capture techniques with conceptual design characteristics. Secondly, mechanical/electrical knowledge is obtained through a case study during conceptual design of a green building project. The mechanical/electrical knowledge and activities are matched in the McMillan Framework (2001) for the conceptual design phase. Later, mechanical/electrical knowledge is matched and assigned to the architectural concept design activities. At the conclusion of the exercise, the study developed a mechanical/electrical knowledge-based framework for the conceptual design phase. Validation of the results was obtained by using computational organizational theory simulation. This study contributes in extending McMillan’s Framework to include explicit fundamental required mechanical/electrical knowledge during the conceptual design phase; developing a tacit knowledge capture technique by combining tacit observation and explicit repertory grid documentation; and improving Nissen’s (2006) multidimensional model (MDM) by integrating knowledge into Macmillan’s framework for conceptual design activities. These results support the need to mitigate potential knowledge losses in tacit-dominant area between experts during conceptual design phase of building projects.

T1  - The Extended-OPQ Method for User-Centered Quality of Experience Evaluation: A Study for Mobile 3D Video Broadcasting over DVB-H
AN  - 863252258
AB  - The Open Profiling of Quality (OPQ) is a mixed methods approach combining a conventional quantitative psychoperceptual evaluation and qualitative descriptive quality evaluation based on naïve participants' individual vocabulary. The method targets evaluation of heterogeneous and multimodal stimulus material. The current OPQ data collection procedure provides a rich pool of data, but full benefit of it has neither been taken in the analysis to build up completeness in understanding the phenomenon under the study nor has the procedure in the analysis been probed with alternative methods. The goal of this paper is to extend the original OPQ method with advanced research methods that have become popular in related research and the component model to be able to generalize individual attributes into a terminology of Quality of Experience. We conduct an extensive subjective quality evaluation study for 3D video on mobile device with heterogeneous stimuli. We vary factors on content, media (coding, concealments, and slice modes), and transmission levels (channel loss rate). The results showed that advanced procedures in the analysis cannot only complement each other but also draw deeper understanding on Quality of Experience.

T1  - Towards a better understanding of capital investment decisions
AN  - 763665699
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the capital investment process, guided by concepts from cognitive and social psychology. The intention is to gauge the extent to which managerial judgment can be detected by applying a psychological lens to the process. Initial fieldwork is subsequently reported on the extent to which managerial judgment is managed. Discovery of variations suggest an alternative perspective on understanding capital investment decisions (CID) that may be potentially worthwhile in understanding the long-term success and survival of modern commercial enterprises. Following a systematic review, employing the psychological concepts of heuristics, framing and consensus to prior case and fieldwork studies, the CID process in three companies engaged in new market/site development projects is reported. The participants initially responded to a survey and subsequently agreed to be interviewed about their processes and involvement. The psychological concepts provided a satisfactory gauge of managerial judgment. The fieldwork revealed variety in the management of the CID process and the influence of managerial judgment.

T1  - Technological Frames, Organizational Capabilities, and IT Use: An Empirical Investigation of Electronic Procurement
AN  - 608682159
AB  - The process by which organizations incorporate technological innovations into existing routines and use them on a regular basis persists as a central concern in the literature. Although we now have a fairly robust understanding of the drivers of innovation adoption, the use of innovations is less understood. In this paper, we draw on two streams of literature, managerial and organizational sensemaking, and organizational capabilities that have hitherto been used independently, to investigate organizational use of information technology (IT)-based innovations. Building on and extending prior work, we posit that organizational capabilities serve as complements to managers' technological frames related to an innovation. We focus on the use of an important technological innovation-business-to-business (B2B) electronic markets for procurement. We examine interactions between three technological frames-benefits frame, threat frame, and adjustment frame, and two organizational capabilities-technological opportunism and technological sophistication, and their relationship with the use of B2B electronic markets in firms. We test our research model using survey data collected from 292 firms. Results largely support the proposed conceptualization and shed new light on the key factors associated with firms' use of B2B electronic markets. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Prioritised best practices in a ratified consulting services maturity model for ERP consulting
AN  - 220022387
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that lead to consulting success in the enterprise software environment and thereby develop a refined consulting services maturity (CSM) model which includes prioritised best practices grouped under eight key focus areas (KFA). The research is conducted among Tier-1 enterprise resource planning (ERP) vendors using interviews, focus group sessions, and a web survey. Based on the findings of the survey, the CSM model is improved, refined, and ultimately ratified by a number of experienced ERP sector practitioners. The fundamental basis of the CSM model is that an enterprise software company will be able to improve the maturity level of its consulting services operations by focusing on certain key areas and adopting prioritised best practices in each of the key areas. These key areas include leadership, values, consulting skills, consulting success factors, adaptability, project management practices, profitability, and customer focus. The level of maturity of the organisation increases as best practices are implemented and continuously refined. The outcome is a blueprint for best practice consulting services for companies operating in the ERP software environment that can be adopted for very little cost. When implemented, the CSM model readily helps a company improve the performance of its consulting services business. Business performance is enhanced by selecting KFAs, including their associated best practices, and then targeting these for improvement. As further best practices are implemented and refined, the maturity level of the consulting practice increases. This model can easily be adopted by any consulting services company and with the necessary focus, it should lead to a dramatic improvement of most dimensions of a consulting practice.

T1  - Middle grades in-service teachers pedagogical content knowledge of student internal representation of equivalent fractions and algebraic expressions
AN  - 288023486
AB  - This study examined teacher pedagogical content knowledge changes through a Middle School Mathematics Program professional development workshop, development of noticing use of student representations, and teacher changes in hypothetical learning trajectories due to noticed aspects of student representation corresponding to the hypothetical learning trajectory model.    Using constant comparatives and repertory grid analysis, data was collected in two phases. Phase one, the teacher pre-test, occurred at the beginning of the summer of the 2003 professional development workshop. Phase two, the teacher post-test, occurred at the end of the workshop. Twenty-four teachers supplied data on pre- and post-tests during phases one and two. Eleven teachers were from Texas and 13 from Delaware. Six Texas and eight Delaware teachers worked with the algebraic expression concepts. Five Texas and five Delaware teachers worked with the equivalent fraction concepts. Four mathematics education researchers from Texas, three from Delaware, and two from the American Association for the Advancement of Science participated in facilitating the professional development.    The results show that teacher pedagogical content knowledge changes with the help of a professional development partnership. The differences in knowledge can be measured with a hierarchal cluster analysis of the repertory grid by analyzing relationships between constructs and elements. Teacher hypothetical learning trajectories change depending on student representations of what they do and do not know about concepts.    The study encourages teachers to use knowledge of students’ representation about a concept to determine what to teach next and how the concept should be taught. Teachers should use different types of representations including formal, imagistic, and action representations in teaching mathematical ideas. This will promote student development in all process standards including reasoning and proof, communication, problem solving, and connection.    The findings suggest that teacher pedagogical content knowledge can be redefined during professional development partnerships. Furthermore, teachers’ knowledge of representation is varied and emphasis on the imagistic representation should be explored further. Finally, professional development models that facilitate how to extract what a student does and does not know based on representation, can be the basis for defining hypothetical learning trajectories.

T1  - Usability of Online Services: The Role of Technology Readiness and Context*
AN  - 198116776
AB  - An important prerequisite for the success of any online service is ensuring that customers' experience-via the interface-satisfies both sensory and functional needs. Developing interfaces that are responsive to customers' needs requires a perspective on interface design as well as a deep understanding of the customers themselves. Drawing upon research in consumer behavior concerning consumer beliefs about technology, we deploy an alternative way to describe customers based on psychographic characteristics. Technology readiness (TR), a multidimensional psychographic construct, offers a way to segment online customers based upon underlying positive and negative technology beliefs. The core premise of this study is that the beliefs form the foundation for expectations of how things should work and how specific online service interfaces are evaluated by customers. At the same time, usability evaluations of specific online services might be contingent on contextual factors, specifically the type of site (hedonic vs. utilitarian) and access method (Web vs. wireless Web). The aspects of usability examined here are those incorporated into the usability metric and instrument based on the Microsoft Usability Guidelines (MUG). The results of an empirical study with 160 participants indicate that (i) TR customer segments vary in usability requirements and (ii) usability evaluations of specific online service interfaces are influenced by complex interactions among site type, access method, and TR segment membership. As organizations continue to expand their online service offerings, managers must recognize that the interface exists to serve the customers, so their design must be matched to market needs and TR.

T1  - Forecasting future competency requirements: a three-phase methodology
AN  - 214827160
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to introduce an integrated three-phase methodology for forecasting future competency requirements more effectively than existing methods. The methodology is demonstrated with reference to empirical research conducted by the authors. The methodology consists of three phases: phase 1 - preliminary interviews, phase 2 - questionnaire, and phase 3 - critical incident technique interviews. Outputs from phases 1 and 2 are used to generate a framework through which to elicit future competency requirements during phase 3. The empirical findings, although included, are incidental to the current paper; they serve solely to illustrate the methodology. As such, the development and demonstration of this methodology are the main "findings" of the paper. Methodologies for forecasting future competency requirements should adopt structured integrated approaches to improve predictive accuracy. The methodology is described in sufficient detail so as to enable its practical application by HR professionals and academic researchers alike. Both groups will find this methodology extremely useful.

T1  - The Inclusion of Stakeholder Knowledge and Perspectives in Integrated Assessment of Climate Change
AN  - 198500646
AB  - Over the past few decades Integrated Assessment (IA) has emerged as an approach to link knowledge and action in a way that is suitable to accommodate uncertainties, complexities and value diversities of global environmental risks. Responding to the complex nature of the climate problem and to the changing role of climate change in the international climate policy process, the scientific community has started to include stakeholder knowledge and perspectives in their assessments. Participatory Integrated Assessment (PIA) is in its early stage of development. Methodology varies strongly across PIA projects. This paper analyzes four recent IA projects of climate change that included knowledge or perspectives from stakeholders in one-way or another. Approaches and methods used turn out to differ in whether stakeholders are involved actively or passively, whether the approach is bottom-up or top-down, and whether the different functions in the IA process are open or closed to stakeholder input. Also, differences can be seen in the degree to which boundaries are pre-set that limit the roles and domains of competencies attributed to each scientific or non-scientific participant (so-called boundary work). The paper discusses pros and cons of the various approaches identified, and outlines heuristics and considerations to assist those who plan, design or fund new IA processes with stakeholder input on what approaches best to choose in view of the objectives for stakeholder involvement, in view of the role that the IA plays in the overall risk management process and in view of considerations regarding boundary work.

T1  - Controlling healthcare associated infections (HAI) and the role of facilities management in achieving "quality" in healthcare: a three-dimensional view
AN  - 219657566
AB  - This study explores the role of facilities management (FM) in the control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) and then to discuss a three-dimensional approach which can be used for FM services in the control of infections (HAI). Most of what is put forward in this paper is based on a research project which is at its early stages. The discussions are therefore grounded on a thorough review of literature accomplished as part of the research project. Unstructured interviews with experts (sample - 25) in infection control in National Health Service in Scotland (NHSS), carried out concurrently as a pilot study, also provided useful insights. It is suggested that integrating FM effectively with the core services is vital in avoiding duplication of work carried out by the healthcare workers. Continuous measurement and management of performance of FM services is also vital in the control of HAI.

T1  - Developing theoretical models of website usability: Instrument development and validation
AN  - 305007966
AB  - Developing usable websites is pivotal for the success of e-business since online consumers touch, feel, search, and experience products (or services) mainly through the websites. However, studies have reported that a majority of current websites contain several usability problems. There are many reasons for poorly designed websites, but this study focuses on the lack of a good theoretical model of website usability. Such a model would explain and predict the effects of website usability on the perceptions of online consumers. This study proposes and validates two new theoretical models of website usability by adopting and extending Kaplan's landscape preference model in environmental psychology and music composition theory in music.    Three separate field studies are conducted to validate the proposed theoretical models, whose data are used for investigating psychometric properties of the instruments, nomological networks, and generalizability under different boundary conditions. Structural equation modeling technique (LISREL) is utilized to conduct measurement and structural model analysis.    The findings demonstrate that the proposed models explain a large amount of variance of cognitive and affective appraisals, purchase intention and actual purchase, and measurement instruments have good psychometric properties. The generalizability of the models also is confirmed under different gender and age.    For researchers, this study proposes two alternative theoretical models, which can be used as alternatives for stimulating prolific research in the website usability area and thereby enhancing our understanding of the effect of website usability on the perceptions of online consumers. The validated instruments also can be utilized in future usability studies and accumulated study findings can be directly compared.    For practitioners, determination of the relationships between website usability constructs will primarily aid website designers in successfully allocating limited website design resources to enhance overall website design quality. Moreover, using the identified instruments and nomological networks, management of e-business companies can evaluate the usability level of their own websites and at the same time, compare the usability level of their website with that of their competitors to establish industrial standards. By evaluating the usability levels of the website and comparing it with that of its competitors', e-business companies can make strategic decisions on how to improve current websites.

T1  - Rep grid and HICLAS analyses of individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder
AN  - 304994156
AB  - A hierarchical classification analysis was performed on the Kelly rep grid data of individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (n=29) and a control group (n=25). Contrary to expectations, as conceptual links ascend from the bottom level to the next superordinate level: (a) the control group did not show a significantly higher incidence of convergence than the BPD group, (b) the BPD group did not show a significantly higher incidence of divergence than the control group, and (c) in those instances of divergence, the BPD group did not show a significantly higher incidence of trifurcation than the control group. However, the results did show a slight trend in the predicted directions.    Results suggest that: (a) divergence may, depending on the individual, imply either a chaotic or a complex and sophisticated conceptual structure, and (b) convergence may, depending on the individual, imply either a well ordered or a rigid conceptual structure.    Future research will concentrate on finding a method to distinguish between chaos vs. complexity, and rigidity vs. well ordered conceptual structure.

T1  - Validity of the Structural Properties of Text-Based Causal Maps: An Empirical Assessment
AN  - 195080748
AB  - Recently, text-based causal maps (TBCMs) have generated enthusiasm as a methodological tool because they provide a way of accessing large, untapped sources of data generated by organizations. Although TBCMs have been used extensively in organizational behavior and strategic management research, studies assessing the psychometric properties of TBCM measures are virtually nonexistent. With the intention of facilitating large-sample substantive research using TBCMs, the authors examine the construct validity of two most frequently employed structural properties of TBCMs: complexity and centrality. In assessing construct validity, they examine the internal consistency, dimensionality, and predictive validity of the structural properties. The results suggest that complexity is not a general cognitive attribute. Rather, it is indicative of domain knowledge. On the other hand, centrality, which reflects the degree of hierarchy characterizing the TBCM, is related to cognitive ability and may reflect general information processing. Moreover, complexity and centrality, but not cognitive ability, predicted student performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Causal Cognitive Mapping in the Organizational Strategy Field: A Comparison of Alternative Elicitation Procedures
AN  - 195076983
AB  - This study evaluates two alternative causal cognitive mapping procedures that exemplify key differences among a number of direct elicitation techniques currently in use in the organizational strategy field: pairwise evaluation of causal relationships and a freehand approach. The pairwise technique yielded relatively elaborate maps, but participants found the task more difficult, less engaging, and less representative than the freehand approach. Implications for the choice of procedures in interventionist and research contexts are considered.

T1  - Think international manager, think male: Why are women not selected for international management assignments?
AN  - 202785423
AB  - Studies of women in international management originating primarily from North America consistently highlight the lack of women in such positions. This trend continues despite the need for growing numbers of expatriates. Explanations for this phenomenon have centered on women's personal characteristics, home/family circumstances, organizational support and host country nationals' attitudes. This study examines the status of women in international management from a UK perspective. A key finding is the critical influence of selection systems for international assignments where the predominant use of closed, informal selection processes for international assignments was seen to create unintended gender bias in recruitment.

AN  - 225003822
AB  - A developing stream of research in the strategy field explores the competitive structure of industries from the perspective of industry participants. This work has demonstrated that managers develop strategic group knowledge structures in order to make sense of their competitive environment. This study extends this line of research in order to make sense of their competitive environment. This study extends this line of research by examining the complexity evident in the strategic group knowledge structures developed by firms' top management teams and assessing the relationship between the complexity in these knowledge structures and subsequent firm performance.

T1  - A two-dimensional model of cognitive empathy: An empirical study
AN  - 305585985
AB  - This study was designed to investigate the validity of a proposed theoretical model of cognitive empathy. The model consists of a circumplex with two separate constructs free to vary independently of one another, creating a contingency table: Altruism (A) on the X-Axis, measuring the ability to see similarities between self and other; and Cognitive Complexity (CC) on the Y-Axis, the capacity to see differences.    Four interpersonal relationship styles were hypothesized to result from the combination of A and CC: Cognitive Empathy—high scores on both A and CC. This is the quadrant of resonant understanding and describes the “I-Thou” relationship. Psychopathy or a less malevolent Expedience—high scores on CC but low on A, describing a contractual, contingent style characterized by the “I-You” relationship. Extremely low scores on A would indicate a more antisocial stance.  Co-Dependence—low scores on CC and high on A: a state of emotional confiscation characterized by the “I-We” relationship, without much of an “I.” Narcissism—low scores on both A and CC, suggesting an incapacity to decenter and reflect. It is characterized by an “I-It” relationship style.    A convenience sample of 344 subjects was solicited by direct mail, and obtained from two formal university subjects pools—a large state university and a large private Catholic university.    The study relied on a correlational design, augmented by hierarchical regressions and a 2 x 2 MANCOVA. To determine if the model was correct, the independent variables of Altruism (a subscale of the Helping Orientation Questionnaire) and Cognitive Complexity (measured by the 4 x 6 Repertory Grid) were examined for their relationship to the key dependent variables: Cognitive Empathy, four subscales of Co-Dependence, Primary Psychopathy, and Narcissism. Several additional measures were added to assess discriminant and convergent validity: Authoritarianism (CC); Splitting (Narcissism), Receptive Giving (Expedience); Empathic Concern (A); and seven subscales of the Love Attitudes Questionnaire. The Crowne Marlowe was added to control for social desirability; age and gender were also used as control variables.    The results of the study did not support the model as measured. Altruism appeared to measure what it purported to measure, yielding positive relationships with Empathic Concern and Perspective Taking, and negative relationships with Psychopathy, Personal Distress, and Splitting. Cognitive Complexity, on the other hand, contrary to previous studies, was positively related to Splitting and unrelated to Authoritarianism, suggesting that the 4 x 6 Repertory Grid did not measure Cognitive Complexity, a potential failure of construct validity.

T1  - Interpreting consumer perceptions of advertising: An application of the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique
AN  - 236502978
AB  - For more than three decades, research has theorized about and investigated consumers' attitudes toward advertising. In a study, fourteen US consumers are interviewed using the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique, a method that involves semi-structured, in-depth, personal interviews centered around visual images. The metaphor and cross-case analyses further contribute to an understanding of consumers' impressions of advertising and the meanings that they associate with it. The metaphors attributed to advertising reveal that advertising has positive value, in that it relates information, provides entertainment, and stimulates growth in the economy. However, the goodwill derived from these aspects of advertising is countered by several liabilities, as epitomized by the omnipresent being, nosy neighbor, con-man, seducer, and evil therapist metaphors.

T1  - Using personal construct theory and narrative methods to facilitate reflexive constructions of teaching physical education
AN  - 1889714964
AB  - This paper reports on two lengthy studies in physical education teacher education (PETE) conducted independently but which are epistemologically and methodologically linked. The paper describes how personal construct theory (PCT) and its associated methods provided a means for PETE students to reflexively construct their ideas about teaching physical education over an extended period. Data are drawn from each study in the form of a story of a single participant to indicate how this came about. Furthermore we suggest that PCT might be both a useful research strategy and an effective approach to facilitate professional development in a teacher education setting.

T1  - Making ethical judgements: A cross-cultural management study: APJM APJM
AN  - 228385529
AB  - This article reports the results of a cross-cultural empirical study across 7 countries which investigates the differences in the way managers structure their ethical judgments regarding the loyalty of a corporation to its employees, the loyalty of employees to the corporation, and the loyalty of employees towards their co-workers. Managers' ethical judgments from the East Asian "tiger" countries of Japan, Korea and Hong Kong are compared with those from the "Anglo" countries of the US and Australia, and with those from the "transitional" countries of Asiatic Russia and Poland. As hypothesized, cross-cultural differences were indicated for both the structure and content of managers' ethical judgments, which have important implications for the way organizations are effectively managed both nationally, regionally and internationally.

AN  - 198099865
AB  - Towards the general goal of generating a normative-empirical dialogue about ethics and justice, the present study explored three issues: 1. the extent to which the normative criteria of ethics and justice prescribed by moral philosophers are indeed reflected in managerial professionals' subjective beliefs of what ethical and just work behavior ought to be, 2. the relationship between people's ought beliefs and their perceptions of actual ethical and just work behavior, and 3. the relationship between the notions of ethics and justice. To do so, a review of the normative and positive theories of ethics was carried out which revealed the key normative criteria of ethics and justice.

T1  - An introduction to the Priority-Pointing Procedure
AN  - 215210807
AB  - A qualitative research-based diagnostic procedure, the Priority-Pointing Procedure (PPP), is proposed that synthesizes responses to open-ended questions about the direction an organization should take. It points to a priority for action by measuring imbalances in the numbers of responses in the context of the structure of adjustment decision-making from nomology. It is shown to be useful for defining variables and structuring criteria for strategic Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) problems. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A grounded model of organizational schema change during empowerment
AN  - 213827612
AB  - This paper analyzes resistance to an organizational change project in which employees were empowered to participate in the design of a new organizational structure. What emerged from the analysis was the importance of cognitive barriers to empowerment. Employees' resistance appeared to be motivated less by intentional self-interest than by the constraints of well-established, ingrained schemas. A grounded model of schema change is developed for changes in organizational decision-making schemas during empowerment efforts. Theoretical implications and suggestions for improving organizational change efforts are proposed.

AN  - 235231373; 01527166
AB  - Research methods are generally improved through new understandings of scientific procedure, validity and reliability.  Variations in these understandings - among knowledge communities as diverse as ethnographers, statisticians, historians and even practitioners and researchers - yield a rich set of innovations in quantitative tools, experimental designs, data collection instruments, observational methods, sampling procedures and interpretive frameworks.  Research methods, however, must be consonant not only with the way various communities view scientific inquiry, but also with fundamental characteristics of the thought and behavior of customers and managers.  Most widely used methods in marketing lack the latter consonance.  A study introduces particular insights about thought and behavior from multiple disciplines as design criteria for improving research methods.

T1  - Graduates' construction systems and career development
AN  - 231466577; 01421519; 03257530
AB  - A paper draws on the Chicago School's conceptualization of career and on personal construct psychology to examine the relationships between graduates' construction systems and patterns of career development during the 1st 4 years of employment.  It seeks to identify differences in trends of constructive revision between "successful" and "less successful" graduates.  The results show some significant change in the nature of the constructs elicited by graduates over the 4 years; in particular, graduates made greater use of constructs related to achievement, cynicism, and organizational politics.  Graduates whose career was more successful were more likely to use constructs related to social behavior and flexibility on entering employment, while graduates whose career was less successful were more likely to construe themselves in terms of achievement and work competence.  Four years later, successful graduates tended to rely more on constructs related to achievement and flexibility, while less successful graduates were more likely to use constructs related to social behavior.

T1  - Navigating by attire: The use of dress by female administrative employees
AN  - 199775870; 01393386
AB  - An inductive study of the everyday decisions about dress at work of female administrative employees in a university business school was conducted.  Findings reveal that dress is an attribute embedded in a variety of cognitive schemata that govern individuals' comprehension of a behavior at work.  In acquiring and executing these schemata, employees make efforts that enhance their emotional preparedness for jobs and improve interpersonal relations.  The study offers implications for theory and research on organizational symbolism, role taking, and the current practical trend toward relaxed dress.

T1  - An investigation of the perception of most important caring attributes of the nurse manager as rated by staff nurses
AN  - 304409263
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the most important caring attributes of the nurse manager as rated by medical/surgical, and critical care staff nurses. The 20-item Nyberg Caring Assessment Scale and a demographic data sheet were sent to 96 nurses in two rural eastern Kentucky acute care facilities. Forty-five of the questionnaires were completed and returned for a 46.8% return rate.    Descriptive statistics revealed that item #4, Communicate a helping, trusting attitude towards others was rated as the most important caring attribute of the nurse manager, while item #8, considers relationships before rules was rated as the least important caring attribute of the nurse manager.    Findings of the study indicate that attributes of the nurse manager affects the workplace, and that caring has a positive effect on attitude and may impact on employee satisfaction and productivity. Further, results indicate that a nurse manager who is able to communicate caring, while demonstrating professionalism may be best suited to the task of nurse manager now and in the future.

T1  - Extracting team mental models through textual analysis: Summary
AN  - 228831519
AB  - An approach, called map analysis, for extracting, analyzing and combining representations of individual's mental models as cognitive maps is presented. This textual analysis technique allows the researcher to extract cognitive maps, locate similarities across maps, and combine maps to generate a team map. Using map analysis the researcher can address questions about the nature of team mental models and the extent to which sharing is necessary for effective teamwork. This technique is illustrated using data drawn from a study of software engineering teams. The impact of critical coding choices on the resultant findings is examined. It is shown that various coding choices have systematic effects on the complexity of the coded maps and their similarity. Consequently, a thorough analysis requires analyzing the data several times under different coding choices. For example, re-analysis under different coding scenarios revealed that although members of successful teams tend to have more elaborate, more widely shared maps than members of non-successful teams, this difference is significant only when the data is unfiltered. Thus a better interpretation of this result is that all teams have comparable models, but successful teams are able to describe their models in more ways than are non-successful teams.

T1  - Inside the black box of alpha, beta, and gamma change: Using a cognitive-processing model to assess attitude structure
AN  - 210969497; 01264242
AB  - One of the key aspects of organizational and societal interventions is different kinds of attitude change.  These different kinds of change have been operationalized in terms of the well-known Alpha, Beta and Gamma change typology.  Researchers who use this typology have considered changes at state A (time 1) and state B (time 2), but have not examined the process involved for Alpha, Beta and Gamma change in moving from state A to state B.  To move inside this black box, a model is developed of attitude and structure, and the cognitive processes hypothesized to yield attitude structure changes corresponding to the Alpha, Beta and Gamma typology are examined.  Testable research propositions are developed, and it is shown how the model can help to guide future research and practical applications across a wide range of interventions.

T1  - A group support systems approach to cognitive mapping: JMIS JMIS
AN  - 218934426; 00922679
AB  - Cognitive maps are valuable tools for understanding group as well as individual perceptions.  However, developing such maps is a resource-intensive activity.  In order to reduce required resources, group support system (GSS) technology is proposed as an aid in uncovering cognitive maps.  A GSS session is used to develop a cognitive map of users of object-oriented (OO) techniques of OO system complexity.  Seven participants identified concepts and categories, categorized the concepts, rated category importance, and defined relationships between categories.  The data collected and analyses performed provide the basis for a cognitive map of the participants' perceptions of OO system complexity.  A comparison with similar individual cognitive mapping results supports further investigation of using the GSS approach for identifying perceptions of complexity.
