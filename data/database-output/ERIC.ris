N2  - The purpose of this study is to determine the cognitive constructs of teachers on democratic education in schools. For this purpose, the study was modelled as a case study. The study group was 20 teachers and determined by using maximum variation sampling method. Repertory grid technique was used to collect data. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis technique. The participants produced 200 valid cognitive constructs related to the democratic education in school. The most frequently mentioned cognitive constructs were respectively: (1) motivation increases, (2) confidence/self-confidence, (3) job satisfaction increases, (4) tolerance, (5) participative management, (6) employees feel precious, (7) organisational commitment, (8) new opinions, (9) human rights, and (10) freedom of ideas/impressions. The cognitive constructs were classified considering functionality and the similarity of them. As a result of classification, 14 main groups were determined according to the 200 valid cognitive constructs. Democratic participation should be encouraged by the school administrators. Besides, school society should display democratic attitudes for democratic education. In addition, the school administrators should appreciate students, teachers and parents in terms of success of school they manage. (As Provided)

T1  - Swedish PE Teachers Struggle with Assessment in a Criterion-Referenced Grading System

N2  - In the field of education, the international trend is to turn to criterion-referenced grading in the hope of achieving accountable and consistent grades. Despite a national criterion-referenced grading system emphasising knowledge as the only base for grading, Swedish physical education (PE) grades have been shown to value non-knowledge factors, such as students' characteristics and behaviour. In 2011, a new national curriculum was implemented which attempts to deal with the problem by prescribing specific knowledge requirements with a clear progression as the only basis for different grades. The aim of the present study is to explore the impact of the new knowledge requirements on what teachers consider important when assigning grades. It is also to discuss what non-knowledge-related aspects (if any) teachers continue to look for and why these seem to remain resilient to the reform. The Repertory Grid technique was employed to interview the teachers before (2009) and after the implementation (2013). During the interviews, the grading of 45 students was discussed, which generated 125 constructs. After the implementation, there was a near doubling of knowledge constructs, half as many motivation constructs and an almost total elimination of constructs based on confidence and social skills. While motivational factors were still considered valuable for the award of a higher grade, clear criteria seemed to be important, but too limited for the teachers' needs. In order to understand the persistence of motivational factors, we discuss the results in relation to Bernstein's interrelated message systems of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. We emphasise the need to discuss how valid grades can be achieved and, at the same time, give value to the regulative discourse in order to realise the overarching national goals of values and norms in education and PE.

N2  - Augmented reality (AR) offers potential advantages for intensifying environmental context awareness and augmenting students' experiences in real-world environments by dynamically overlapping digital materials with a real-world environment. However, some challenges to AR learning environments have been described, such as participants' cognitive overload and the ways to provide assistance in constructing the presented learning materials. In this study, a mindtool-based AR learning system was developed, based on the repertory grid method and the contiguity principle of multimedia learning, for assisting students in constructing their knowledge in a natural science course. Furthermore, an experiment was carried out on an elementary school natural science course to compare the influences of this method with those of the conventional AR learning system on students' learning effectiveness. The experimental results show that the designated approach effectively promoted the students' learning achievements, and no significant difference existed between the mindtool-based AR learning system and the conventional AR learning system in terms of students' cognition load and satisfaction degree; moreover, both the experimental group and the control group perceived low cognition load during the learning activity and rated their own AR learning systems as being highly satisfactory.

N2  - Many protocols assessing social communication skills of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are based on behavioral observations. It has been suggested, however, that social cognition encompasses processes underlying observable behaviors. Such processes include personal constructs, which can be assessed using repertory grids. Personal constructs of five adolescents with ASD with average or above average intelligence and receptive and expressive language skills were explored using repertory grids in this study. With visual structure and verbal scaffolding, all participants successfully engaged in the repertory grid process. Data suggest participants had well organized, complex construct systems, a significant understanding of social roles, and were interested in social interactions. Repertory grids may provide additional person-centered information for assessing social communication skills in ASD. (As Provided)

N2  - This research examines how adolescent males (ages 16-17 years) construct and experience their masculine identities within the context of physical education (PE). A class of 23 boys and 3 girls from a state secondary school in Scotland were observed over a period of 3 months. During the third month, five of the observed pupils volunteered to take part in a conversation with the lead researcher which was guided by their participation in a repertory grid task. The same five participants also took part in a one-to-one semi-structured interview. The analysis of the evidence revealed that the adolescent pupils internalised and performed an orthodox form of masculinity that centred on strength, pain tolerance and the policing of others. More inclusive masculinities appeared to be emerging, however, the hypermasculine and public nature of the PE environment made it very difficult for the pupils to freely adopt or perform these alternative, more inclusive forms of masculinity. Additionally, pupils who did perform traits associated with inclusive masculinity often exhibited a high degree of social and physical capital. In order to facilitate a culture where all individuals feel free to express their gendered identities, teachers are encouraged to recognise, promote and celebrate multiple masculinities. This could create a safer learning environment for pupils and help prevent identities from being "destroyed" in PE. (As Provided)

N2  - This study presents a systematic literature review focusing on the Interrelationship of Language and the Brain and Language Disorders in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) based on a number of published researches in several refereed international journals available in various online databases. A repertory grid was utilized to plot the responses to the research questions posted. The data on the grid were analyzed to be able to identify the various gaps in the researches conducted. Consequently, this study yields the following concepts: the Role of Assistive Technology and Mediation, Interventions in AAC, and Focus on AAC Outcomes. It is concluded that these concepts should form part of the compendia to be used by language teachers, especially those specializing in psycholinguistics and AAC. Finally, the paper presents suggestions for further research into AAC and psycholinguistics per se. (As Provided)

N2  - Science education today has become increasingly focused on research into complex natural, social and technological systems. In this study, we examined the development of high-school biology students' systems understanding of the human body, in a three-year longitudinal study. The development of the students' system understanding was evaluated using the Components Mechanisms Phenomena (CMP) framework for conceptual representation. We coded and analysed the repertory grid personal constructs of 67 high-school biology students at 4 points throughout the study. Our data analysis builds on the assumption that systems understanding entails a perception of all the system categories, including structures within the system (its Components), specific processes and interactions at the macro and micro levels (Mechanisms), and the Phenomena that present the macro scale of processes and patterns within a system. Our findings suggest that as the learning process progressed, the systems understanding of our students became more advanced, moving forward within each of the major CMP categories. Moreover, there was an increase in the mechanism complexity presented by the students, manifested by more students describing mechanisms at the molecular level. Thus, the "mechanism" category and the micro level are critical components that enable students to understand system-level phenomena such as homeostasis. (As Provided)

N2  - This paper investigates using data-driven learning (DDL) as a means of stimulating greater lexicogrammatical knowledge and reading speed among lower proficiency learners in an extensive reading program. For 16 weekly 90-minute sessions, an experimental group (12 students) used DDL materials created from a corpus developed from the Oxford Bookworms Graded Readers, while a control group (10 students) had no DDL input. Both classes were required to read a minimum of 200,000 words during the course. An embedded-experiment design (Edmonds & Kennedy, 2017) was adopted consisting of both qualitative and quantitative forms of investigation. Quantitative data from the Vocabulary Levels Test by Nation and Beglar (2007) and a C-test (Klein-Braley & Raatz, 1984) constructed from an upper-level Bookworms reader found statistically significant lexicogrammatical improvements for both groups, but greater improvement took place within the control group. Qualitative data derived from a repertory grid analysis of student constructs revealed several possible reasons for the experimental group's lack of engagement with DDL. The study concludes that careful attention to students' learning preferences and a softening of the DDL approach may ensure better results with lower proficiency learners. (As Provided)

N2  - The aim of this study is to identify cognitive constructs of prospective teachers about ideal teacher qualifications. This study was designed as phenomenological pattern which is one of the qualitative research designs. The study was conducted with 36 prospective teachers selected from Yuzuncu Yil University, Faculty of Education. The study group was determined by using criterion sampling method as one of the purposive sampling methods. As a structured interview technique, "repertory grid" was used for data collection. As a result of the study, 356 cognitive constructs were produced by prospective teachers about teacher qualifications and these cognitive constructs were grouped under ten categories namely communication skills, student centeredness, innovativeness, sensitivity, humaneness/joviality, teaching pedagogical skills, leadership/guidance, professional content knowledge, personal values and professional values by taking functions and similarities into consideration. Dominant categories of prospective teachers' cognitive constructs are teaching pedagogical skills, humaneness/joviality, personal and professional values. Their cognitive constructs play an important role in developing conceptual models of ideal teaching. (As Provided)

N2  - This article reports on the views of selected Southeast Asian and Mexican second language teacher education students regarding the characteristics and pedagogical behaviours of good EFL instructors. A total of 116 participants from Mexico, Brunei, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Vietnam took part in the current investigation. These countries have all been characterized as pedagogically conservative and slow to adopt educational innovations. Data was gathered using the repertory grid technique and was subjected to content, cluster, and principal component analyses. Results foregrounded the importance placed on teachers' positive personality traits. Most significantly, findings indicated a preference for modern teaching approaches among the research participants, despite the pedagogic conservatism of their home countries. (As Provided)

N2  - The relationship between the characteristics of 33 mathematical problem-solving questions answered by 16-year-old students in England and the quality of problem-solving elicited was investigated in two studies. The first study used comparative judgement (CJ) to estimate the quality of the problem-solving elicited by each question, involving 33 mathematics teachers judging pairs of journal-style responses to the questions and the application of the Bradley-Terry model. In the second study a variant of Kelly's Repertory Grid was used with five mathematics teachers to identify 23 dimensions along which the problem-solving questions varied. Significant relationships between ratings on some dimensions and the problem-solving quality estimated in the first study were found. This suggests that the Kelly's Repertory Grid approach could be an effective way to identify features of questions that are relevant to the construct being assessed and features that could be potential sources of construct-irrelevant variance in test scores.

N2  - A five-stage prediction-observation-explanation inquiry-based learning (FPOEIL) model was developed to improve students' scientific learning performance. In order to intensify the science learning effect, the repertory grid technology-assisted learning (RGTL) approach and the collaborative learning (CL) approach were utilized. A quasi-experimental design study was conducted to examine whether the students who used the FPOEIL model only had better learning performances than those who used FPOEIL with RGTL or CL. This study adopted purposive sampling, selecting 123 fourth grade students. The experimental process was conducted during five weeks. It was found that the FPOEIL model improved the students' learning performance. Moreover, the low prior knowledge students who learned science using FPOEIL with RGTL or CL had better learning performances than those who learned using the FPOEIL model only, and the effectiveness showed no significant differences between the low prior knowledge students and the high prior knowledge students. Using the FPOEIL model, the positive effects were intensified in the continuous inquiry-based learning activities and feedback-correction process for the students learning science. The RGTL approach helped the students find, remember, and comprehend scientific knowledge. In the CL process, the students spent more time discussing how to integrate clues to answer the science question. (As Provided)

T1  - Designing and Developing a Novel Hybrid Adaptive Learning Path Recommendation System (ALPRS) for Gamification Mathematics Geometry Course
A1  - Su, Chung-Ho
Y1  - 2017//
Y2  - 2017-06//
N2  - Since recommendation systems possess the advantage of adaptive recommendation, they have gradually been applied to e-learning systems to recommend subsequent learning content for learners. However, problems exist in current learning recommender systems available to students in that they are often general learning content and unable to offer personalized service. To overcome this, in the context of a learning style based on an Interpretive Structural Model (ISM), an adaptive learning path recommendation system is proposed comprising: (a) Fuzzy Delphi Method, (b) Fuzzy ISM; and (c) Kelly Repertory Grid Technology. The results show that the learning outcome with ALPRS is better than those from general learning course guided recommendation mechanisms, and the scores of system satisfaction with ALPRS and personal service are higher than 90%. Results of recall (95%), precision (68%), F1 index (45%) and MAE (8%) prove that ALPRS outperforms other approaches. Finally, three contributions are offered in this study: (1) a novel hybrid ALPRS is proposed and its practicability is tested; (2) a prototype gamification geometry-teaching material module is developed for the promotion in MSTE (Mathematics, Science and Technology Education) areas; and (3) the adaptive geometry-learning path diagram generated with ISM based on learning styles could offer a basis for further studies.

T1  - Personal Constructions of Biological Concepts--The Repertory Grid Approach
A1  - McCloughlin, Thomas J J
A1  - Matthews, Philip S C
Y1  - 2017//
Y2  - 2017//
N2  - This work discusses repertory grid analysis as a tool for investigating the structures of students' representations of biological concepts. Repertory grid analysis provides the researcher with a variety of techniques that are not associated with standard methods of concept mapping for investigating conceptual structures. It can provide valuable insights into the learning process, and can be used as a diagnostic tool in identifying problems that students have in understanding biological concepts. The biological concepts examined in this work are 'natural kinds': a technical class of concepts which "appear" to have invisible "essences" meaning carrying more perceptual weight than being perceptually similar. Because children give more weight to natural-kind membership when reasoning about traits, it would seem pertinent to apply such knowledge to deep-level research into how children reason in biology. The concept of natural kinds has a particular resonance with biology since biological kinds hold the distinction of being almost all natural kinds, such as when the same "stuff or thing" takes many different forms. We have conducted a range of studies using a diversity of biological natural kinds, but in this paper, we wish to explore some of the theoretical underpinnings in more detail. To afford this exploration, we outline one case-study in a small group of secondary school students exploring the concept of "equine"--that is, what is an equine? Five positive examples were chosen to engaged with by the students and one "outlier" with which to compare the construction process. Recommendations are offered in applying this approach to biological education research. (As Provided)

T1  - Swedish PE Teachers' Understandings of Legitimate Movement in a Criterion-Referenced Grading System
A1  - Svennberg, Lena
Y1  - 2017//
Y2  - 2017//
N2  - Background: Physical Education (PE) has been associated with a multi-activity model in which movement is related to sport discourses and sport techniques. However, as in many international contexts, the Swedish national PE syllabus calls for a wider and more inclusive concept of movement. Complex movement adapted to different settings is valued, and in the national grading criteria qualitative measures of movement are used. This research seeks to examine how the wider concept of movement is interpreted and graded. Drawing on Bernstein's concept of the pedagogic device, the paper explores teachers' roles as active mediators in the transformation of national grading criteria for movement and the kinds of movement that are valued in teachers' grading practices. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate what PE teachers consider legitimate movement in a criterion-referenced grading system and the factors that influence their grading practice. The Repertory Grid (RG) technique was employed in order to access their tacit knowledge. Methodology: Seven Swedish PE teachers were interviewed, all of whom teach and grade years seven to nine in different compulsory schools. Using the RG technique, the teachers were asked to reflect on the aspects they considered important for achieving a high grade. The national grading criteria for years seven to nine were then presented one at a time and the teachers were asked to describe how they assessed and graded each requirement. The teachers were also asked whether any specific factors had influenced their grading. In the content analysis, the second part of the interview was attended to first and the results were interpreted in light of Bernsteins' concept of the pedagogic device. Findings: Sport techniques and competitive sports influenced the teachers' interpretations of what constitutes complex movement. The aspect of fitness also appeared to be valued by the teachers in that it facilitates the valued movement. In some cases the difficulty of describing movement qualities in words could reduce the concept of movement to something measurable and quantifiable. The teachers' concerns about students' unequal opportunities to develop and demonstrate their skills also influenced the teachers' interpretation of complex movement. Conclusions: In the transformation of national grading criteria to grading practice, the pedagogic actions taken inform and limit the way in which legitimate movement in PE is conceptualised. Adopting a concept of movement that is wider than competitive sports allows the structures of inequality to be addressed and enables the movements performed by students with other moving experiences than competitive sports to be valued. The tension between the demands of transparency in a high stakes grading system and the inability to articulate the quality of complex movements is problematic. There is a need to verbalise teachers' conceptions about physical education knowledge to be able to discuss and develop the concept of movement. In this process, the RG technique is a potentially useful tool. Having the language to discuss movement qualities also enables us to strengthen the interrelation between curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. (As Provided)

T1  - Exploring Teachers' Meta-Strategic Knowledge of Science Argumentation Teaching with the Repertory Grid Technique

N2  - This study investigated two science teachers' meta-strategic knowledge (MSK) of argumentation teaching by applying the repertory grid technique (RGT). One teacher was a novice, while the other was experienced in teaching argumentation. Using the RGT, we elicited the objectives and strategies of the two teachers regarding their argumentation teaching involving two social scientific issue (SSI) scenarios. The results showed that the experienced teacher had more varied and organised MSK for teaching argumentation than the novice teacher. Meanwhile, the novice teacher indicated a belief that the learning of argumentation should occur in a more student-centred manner, rather than relying on a traditional lecture-based environment. Consequently, she spent a considerable amount of time engaging students with their peers' ideas through discussion and collaboration. On the other hand, the experienced teacher noticed that most of students had the ability to generate arguments, but that few knew how to argue based on evidence. Therefore, she helped students to collect data from various resources and suggested that they construct their own knowledge framework in order to improve students' ability to incorporate their understanding of scientific knowledge into scientific argumentation.

T1  - The Nature and Impact of Task Definition: Information Problem Categorization during Task Definition within the Information Problem-Solving Process
A1  - Marino, John L, Jr
Y1  - 2017//
Y2  - 2017//
N2  - Information literacy describes expertise in information problem-solving. This expertise includes facility in several endeavors addressed by the information behavior literature, including information needs, seeking, and use. Definitions and descriptions of information literacy suggest that this expertise is broadly applicable to a variety of information problems in a variety of content domains. In the library and information science literature, there is scant coverage of the information problem-solving experts, how they think, or whether this expert thinking is transferable to new situations and new contexts. The literature of cognate fields suggests that experts in a variety of domains are more effective in solving problems within their domain than novices because they are more successful in the initial stage of the process, where problem situations are categorized according to those successfully resolved in past experiences. This research project addresses this gap in the library and information science literature by examining the nature and impact of the initial stage of the information problem-solving process, termed Task Definition by the Big6 approach. More than two hundred participants completed a series of online triad judgment tasks designed to identify differences in categorical determinations made by experts and novices in the domain of librarianship, the nature and impact of these differences, and whether these differences extend across domains. In a follow-up investigation, thirty participants met with the researcher and were given similar sorting tasks; verbal reporting of their personal constructs was recorded via Kelly's (1955) repertory grid (RepGrid) technique. The findings indicate that training and experience in librarianship produce predictable expert behavior in information problem-solving, that this expertise is appropriately described by the expertise literature of cognate fields, and that the expert thinking of librarians has value in multiple contexts. This research contributes to a conceptual understanding of information literacy by highlighting the crucial stage of Task Definition in the information problem-solving process, expands the current repertoire of methods currently used to investigate human information behavior, and informs the pedagogy of information literacy as practiced in schools, libraries, and work environments.

T1  - What Is the Function of a Figurine? Can the Repertory Grid Technique Tell?
A1  - Persson, Helena Isakssson
Y1  - 2016//
Y2  - 2016-11//
N2  - Teaching design and product development at upper secondary school level in Sweden is a matter of interdisciplinary considerations. Education in product development, at this level, prepares students for further studies and career in engineering or industrial design. Knowledge of artefacts is an important element in the education. In coherence with the visual and rhetorical strategies characterising the knowledge field, students learn how to develop an idea to a final product. In this study twelve engineers and industrial designers, professionals representing the knowledge field of product development are studied regarding their interpretations of eight pre-selected artefacts. Data is collected and analysed using "repertory grid technique". The aim of the study is to examine whether/what we can learn from the informants' experiences and knowledge that is relevant to education in design and product development at upper secondary school level. Findings show that four of the artefacts appear to be carriers of attributes that reveal the interviewees' definitions of the artefacts' functional nature. From these findings it is shown that the interviewees' definitions of concepts concerning aesthetics/decoration and function can be seen as cultural expressions. How the repertory grid technique is used in this particular study is thoroughly described and the results relevance for education is discussed. (As Provided)

Y1  - 2016//
Y2  - 2016-06//
N2  - This study aims to identify teachers' personal constructs about students and students' personal constructs about teachers and to reveal to what extent they see each other as ideal. The study is descriptive and multiple-case in nature. In this regard, it was conducted with 6 third-grade students with different mean scores and 6 teachers who instructed them in a private school. Teachers' and students' views towards each other were identified through a repertory grid technique, which is a semi-structured interviewing method. Teachers' and students' constructs towards each other are reciprocal. Students who were represented with successful and positive personal constructs, and thus who were placed closely to the ideal student profile, tended to see their teachers as ideal teachers. Similarly, students who were represented with unsuccessful and negative personal constructs by their teachers, and thus were placed as distant from the ideal student profile, tended to evaluate the teachers who had those representations negatively. Findings of the study were discussed in terms of the expectancy effect model and the transactional model. (As Provided)

Y1  - 2016//

N2  - Background: Government strategy indicates that individuals with learning disabilities should have access to adapted psychological therapies. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is recommended for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, there is little published research regarding whether it can be appropriately adapted for adults with learning disabilities. The research available primarily focuses on measures of behavioural and psychiatric change, with little emphasis on the psychological changes that occur. Materials and Methods: Two case studies are presented that using repertory grid technique, based on personal construct psychology (PCP). Both individuals completed repertory grids prior to, and following, adapted DBT for adults with learning disabilities within a specialist community psychology service in the United Kingdom. Results: The case studies show some of the psychological changes that have occurred within adults with learning disabilities who received adapted DBT within a community psychology service. Changes included altered self-esteem and dilemmas individuals have about themselves. Conclusion: The contrasting case studies demonstrate the complexity and idiosyncrasy of the experiences of individuals with learning disabilities who receive DBT, and discuss how this information can be integrated into clinical practice.

N2  - The main objective of this study is to determine the personal constructs of psychological counselors (N = 60) when they characterize their colleagues, effective psychological counselors and self-psychological counseling competence through repertory grid technique. Analysis of the data gathered through repertory grid technique demonstrates that participants generally most characterize counselors and effective counselors with professional qualification, professional background, professionalism, experience which are personal constructs. In addition, counselors' current perception of themselves, their ideal-self and the distance between what they attribute to as ideal and non-ideal was obtained with cluster analysis. The paired sample t-test results showed that counselors view themselves significantly distant from both ideal and non-ideal counselor profiles. They tend to form a clearer opinion of what type of counselor they do not want to become, while they are inclined to be uncertain about what type of counselor they want to become. (As Provided)

T1  - Effects of Doctorate Program on a Novice Teacher's Conceptualization of an Effective Teacher: A Case Study
A1  - Ilin, Gulden
Y1  - 2016//
Y2  - 2016-04//
N2  - This case study, the framework of which is provided by Kelly's Personal Construct Theory, investigates how a female novice ELT teacher structures her constructs on the qualities of an effective teacher. Repertory grid, a cognitive mapping approach, based on Kelly's theory was used as an elicitation technique in the study. The study focused on four main questions. These are how the participant conceptualized an effective teacher, the meanings she attached to the constructs through which she portrayed an effective teacher, the participant's view of "Self" as a teacher, to what she attributed the evolution of these constructs and finally the probable role the program played on these changes, if any. The findings of the study reveal that although the participant's educational repertoire played a major role on the evolution of her theories, we find that theoretical knowledge does suffice to make a teacher an effective one. The study results indicate a need for improvement and change in teacher education at graduate and undergraduate teacher education programs. (As Provided)

N2  - Unreliability in marking is well documented, yet we lack studies that have investigated assessors' detailed use of assessment criteria. This project used a form of Kelly's repertory grid method to examine the characteristics that 24 experienced UK assessors notice in distinguishing between students' performance in four contrasting subject disciplines: that is their implicit assessment criteria. Variation in the choice, ranking and scoring of criteria was evident. Inspection of the individual construct scores in a sub-sample of academic historians revealed five factors in the use of criteria that contribute to marking inconsistency. The results imply that, whilst more effective and social marking processes that encourage sharing of standards in institutions and disciplinary communities may help align standards, assessment decisions at this level are so complex, intuitive and tacit that variability is inevitable. We conclude that universities should be more honest with themselves and with students, and actively help students to understand that application of assessment criteria is a complex judgement and there is rarely an incontestable interpretation of their meaning.

T1  - Mathematics and Biology Teachers&apos; Tacit Views of the Knowledge Required for Teaching: Varying Relationships between CK and PCK
A1  - Rozenszajn, Ronit
A1  - Yarden, Anat
Y1  - 2014//
Y2  - 2014//
N2  - Background: The knowledge that is required for teaching includes subject matter content knowledge (CK) and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Although CK and PCK are distinct components of the teachers' knowledge, the distinction between those two components and the relationships between them are still underexplored. In a previous study, we showed that biology teachers that participated in a long-term professional development program view CK as an important component of the knowledge required for teaching biology, yet they see it as distinct from PCK. We wondered what are the views of mathematics teachers, who participate in a similar program, on the knowledge that is required for teaching and on the relationships between CK and PCK. In addition, we compared the participating mathematics and biology teachers' tacit views of the knowledge required for teaching and on the relationships between CK and PCK. Results: We used the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) as well as semi-structured interviews and a focus group, to elicit mathematics (n = 13) and biology (n = 16) teachers' tacit views about the knowledge that is required for teaching. The results show that both mathematics and biology teachers view CK as a significant component of their teaching practice. However, whereas mathematics teachers tend to view CK and PCK as related entities, biology teachers tend to view them as separate. Conclusions: The main contribution of this study is in exposing that teachers from different disciplines may view differently the importance of high-level CK to their practice. The differences among the participating mathematics and biology teachers' tacit views of the relationships between CK and PCK may aid in the design of professional development programs for mathematics and biology teachers. It is important to draw attention to the ability to recognize the tacit relationships between CK and PCK and to articulate these relationships in planning professional development programs.

N2  - Capitalizing on the power of qualitative approach in drawing out the multiple layers of meaning entrenched in subjective realities, this phenomenological inquiry described the lived experiences of 12 Filipino medical technology deans, as they face their struggles in managing their organization. An in-depth, semi-structured one-on-one interview which lasted for 1-2 h was conducted. Field texts were transcribed and analyzed using a repertory grid and through constant comparative analyses, an interesting model and a set of conceptual themes about deanship struggles were emerged. The 3-D model of deanship struggles, which is a product of the sharing of the respondents, provides a panorama of how Filipino medical technology deans balance (i) superiority and relationality; (ii) rule and role; (iii) obligation and allocation; (iv) personal and professional life; and (v) scholarship and leadership in an educational milieu of (i) prudence; (ii) transparency; (iii) justice; (iv) productivity; and (v) excellence using the gifts of (i) understanding; (ii) flexibility; (iii) bargaining; (iv) hard work; and (v) risk taking. Findings in this paper provide a valuable lens through which the Filipino medical technology deans' mindset as organizational managers could be viewed and understood (As Provided)

N2  - This study aims to understand students' constructs regarding mathematical problems. Fifty-one Taiwanese primary students' constructs are elicited using interviews with the repertory grid technique based on their responses to creative and non-creative problems. The results of qualitative data analysis show that students' initial constructs can be categorized into three cognitive constructs (perception, strategy, and goal, each with deep and surface orientation constructs) and one affective construct. The results of correlation analysis reveal that deep strategy for both creative and non-creative problems and affect for creative problems are related to mathematics achievement. The results of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) reveal that students have fewer surface strategies and more surface goals for creative problems than those for non-creative problems. No significant gender differences or interaction effects between problem types and genders occur for either construct. The results reveal implications for teachers in the development of effective pedagogy for teaching different types of mathematical problems. (As Provided)

Y1  - 2014//
Y2  - 2014//
N2  - This paper outlines a theoretical framework which offers an explanation of the complexity of how teachers define their effectiveness in relation to their classroom practice. The research from which this framework emerged was a two-year, mixed method study of 81 primary and secondary school teachers. The use of repertory grid interviews combined with a number of other methods is unique in a study of teachers' practice and, from the elicited constructs, seven key themes emerged. These themes, analysed in relation to three broad career phases, indicate a number of issues important for teachers as they transfer from early- to late-career. (As Provided)

T1  - Exploring PE Teachers' "Gut Feelings": An Attempt to Verbalise and Discuss Teachers' Internalised Grading Criteria

Y1  - 2014//

N2  - Research shows that teachers' grading is influenced by non-achievement factors in addition to official criteria, such as knowledge and skills. Some grading criteria are internalised by the teacher, who is sometimes unable to verbalise the criteria used and refers to what is called a "gut feeling". Therefore, transparency, validity and reliability are problematic. The aim of this study was to explore which criteria physical education teachers consider important when grading. Such an exploration makes it possible to discuss how the verbalised criteria and the value they are given by the teachers can be understood. Four Year 9 teachers at different Swedish compulsory schools were interviewed using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique. Among the verbalised criteria, four themes were identified: motivation, knowledge and skills, self-confidence and interaction with others. The teachers sometimes had difficulties predicting which criteria had relevance to the grades given, and the criteria considered important by the teachers were not always reflected in the grade. The verbalised criteria revealed teachers using grades to encourage such student behaviours that helped them to handle the classroom situation and to facilitate students learning. To become cognisant of and develop their grading, methods to verbalise their individual grading criteria were needed, and Kelly's Repertory Grid technique is one possible option. The results provide discussion points about reasons for the way teachers are grading. (As Provided)

Y1  - 2013//

N2  - This study investigated an under-explored area in the field of academic practice: the meaning of the complex notion of authenticity in teaching. Combining conceptual with empirical investigation, data included philosophical texts, repertory grid interviews with fifty-five lecturers and students from Law, Physics and English Literature, and fourteen focus groups with forty-six students. Philosophical conceptions were compared to those held by students and lecturers. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of repertory grids revealed differences in experts&apos;/philosophers&apos; and lay-people&apos;s conceptions of authenticity and additionally showed how lecturers&apos; and students&apos; conceptions of authenticity in teaching differed from their conceptions of teaching effectiveness. Focus groups identified linkages between authenticity in teaching and actual teacher actions and attributes that students perceive as being conducive to their learning. The findings enhance the meaning of authenticity, show how it matters in university teaching and offer a hitherto lacking theoretical foundation for further research. (As Provided)

Y1  - 2013//
Y2  - 2013-06//
N2  - This paper outlines a procedure for measuring personal identity that uses self-characterisations to elicit and integrate ideographic data for fixed construct repertory grid nomothetic applications. There is a focus on how family members view their personal identities when they are recovering from the impacts of having a "loved one" with a mental illness and/or substance used disorder. The unique nature of personal and relational empowerment journeys necessitates the use of an ideographic approach to capture changes in personal identity. A significant research implication for this procedure is that the consistent meaning generated through this initially ideographic approach can then be used to explore changes in identity across larger populations. The clinical implications include having a phenomenological framework upon which care plans that include a focus on identity processes can be individually tailored. (As Provided)

N2  - Studies examining staff attitudes toward people with intellectual disability have traditionally used pre-determined categories and models or been open to researcher bias. The use of methods derived from personal construct psychology permits an objective investigation of staff views and attitudes without such limitations. Fourteen staff from an inpatient intellectual disability service were interviewed about their perceptions of clients with challenging behavior primarily using the repertory grid technique as developed from personal construct theory. Staff was found to construe their clients and their behaviors in a heterogeneous manner that was not readily reducible to a group average, and they did not make or use attributions about them in a consistent manner. Future research should incorporate work culture and the staff-client relationship. The results have implications for clinical decision making, team working, and clinical supervision. (As Provided)

Y2  - 2012//
N2  - The purpose of the present study is to examine cognitive fictions of classroom teachers about the values they possess. The study was designed with a phenomenological pattern, which is a qualitative research pattern. It was conducted with 20 classroom teachers who work in the central Yakutiye district of Erzurum who were chosen via criterion sampling method which is a purposeful sampling method. Data were collected with the repertory grid form based on the structured interview technique. Content analysis was used in data analysis. Two hundred cognitive fictions and 11 cognitive fiction groups were obtained at the end of the study. Among these groups, tolerance, trustability/honesty and diligence composed the main fiction group of many participants. Helpfulness, equality, sharing and social sensitivity groups were determined not to be main fiction group of any participant. (Contains 1 footnote.) (As Provided)

T1  - A Critical Review of Some Qualitative Research Methods Used to Explore Rater Cognition

Y2  - 2012//
N2  - Internationally, many assessment systems rely predominantly on human raters to score examinations. Arguably, this facilitates the assessment of multiple sophisticated educational constructs, strengthening assessment validity. It can introduce subjectivity into the scoring process, however, engendering threats to accuracy. The present objectives are to examine some key qualitative data collection methods used internationally to research this potential trade-off, and to consider some theoretical contexts within which the methods are usable. Self-report methods such as Kelly's Repertory Grid, think aloud, stimulated recall, and the NASA task load index have yielded important insights into the competencies needed for scoring expertise, as well as the sequences of mental activity that scoring typically involves. Examples of new data and of recent studies are used to illustrate these methods' strengths and weaknesses. This investigation has significance for assessment designers, developers and administrators. It may inform decisions on the methods' applicability in American and other rater cognition research contexts. (Contains 1 note and 3 tables.) (As Provided)

N2  - Comparability between different educational qualifications is an important issue within policy discourse in the UK. In this context, the comparability of qualification demands has been explored through the use of expert human judgement. The involvement of human judgement in estimating assessment demands has consequences for methodology. This review considered the ways that the Kelly's Repertory Grid (KRG) technique has been used to compare assessment demands over recent years. The review involved the identification and analysis of research documents as well as consideration of the original theory on which the KRG method was founded. This article describes how the technique has been adapted as it has shifted from its original psychotherapeutic context to be used in educational assessment and comparability studies. The review also explored possible disadvantages that stem from these adaptations, leading to recommendations to ensure the validity of findings when using the technique in educational assessment studies.

T1  - Aesthetic Learning about, in, with and through the Arts: A Curriculum Study
A1  - Lindstrom, Lars
Y1  - 2012//
Y2  - 2012-06//
N2  - Aesthetic learning is a major issue in arts education. The "method of art" is often expected to facilitate in-depth learning not only in the arts but across the curriculum. This article defines aesthetic learning in terms of a conceptual framework based on two dimensions, one representing the goal and the other the means of aesthetic learning. The "goal" is described as convergent or divergent. Convergent learning is goal-directed, focused and rational, while divergent learning is explorative, open-ended and intuitive. The "means" are described as medium-specific or medium-neutral. Medium-specific learning emphasises the forms of representation, for example words, pictures, algebra, dance. Medium-neutral learning emphasises instrumental aspects of learning, such as academic achievement or personal development. Combining these dimensions two-by-two, the author arrives at a suggested definition of what is meant by learning "about," learning in, learning "with" and learning "through" the arts. The rest of the article investigates the potential utility of this framework in various contexts and for different purposes. First, the author presents two temporary "Culture-in-School" projects. Secondly, the framework is used to study aesthetic learning processes in "sloyd" (art & craft), based on student teachers' portfolios in metalwork. Thirdly, the four modes of learning are compared to equivalent modes of teaching: the "instructor," the "facilitator," the "advisor" and the "educator." Fourthly, there is a discussion on the role of aesthetics in a "balanced" curriculum. Finally, there is an argument on the need for a variety of assessment tools based on the four modes of learning and teaching, such as "copying," "portfolios," "projects" and the "repertory grid technique."

N2  - The present research aims at pinpointing differences in spontaneous and non-spontaneous mental models of water cycle conceptions of two 4th grade student groups: the Jewish residents of a small provincial town and a group of students from an indigenous Bedouin community. Students' conceptions were elicited using the Repertory Grid technique as well by being asked to draw "what happens to water in nature?" In later interviews, in addition to answering specially designed open-ended interview questions, the students were also requested to elaborate on their drawings and responses to the Repertory Grid technique. The Bedouin students were found to have richer mental models of water cycle phenomena; their models included more components of the water cycle and were more authentic and connected to other natural phenomena. On the other hand, Bedouin students also employed theological explanations to make sense of water cycle phenomena. These findings, as well as methodological issues relating to spontaneous and non-spontaneous models elicitation are discussed and implications for instruction are offered. (As Provided)

N2  - Many people with intellectual disabilities are still not being listened to by the services providing them with care and support, and when they become upset and frustrated, they are all too readily regarded as being mentally ill. To help people with intellectual disabilities describe and make sense of their experiences and feelings in a non-judgemental manner, and without the need for these experiences to be interpreted and explained, this paper describes the use of an adapted repertory grid procedure developed from George Kelley's personal construct psychology. Although such an approach has been identified as being particularly suitable for working with people with intellectual disabilities in a person-centred manner, little information has been presented and to remedy this, this paper presents an outline of PCP, its application with people with intellectual disabilities and two case reports to illustrate its use in clinical practice.

N2  - In recent years, digital learning has been converting from e-learning to m-learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with mobile devices. Consequently, context-aware ubiquitous learning (u-learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless, mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in the learning process. In this paper, a context-aware u-learning environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition, we probe the feasibility of context-aware u-learning in courses by soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable of enhancing students' motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover, it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better control of class order. (As Provided)

Y1  - 2011//
Y2  - 2011-03//
N2  - This paper describes project work undertaken in order to map out and analyze language teachers' experiences and views of various assessment principles and procedures with a particular focus on those that promote learning and relate to grading. A questionnaire survey in a nationally representative sample of 605 language education teachers in Sweden was conducted. In a second stage, a sub-sample of 20 teachers was then strategically drawn from the total sample for participation in a repertory grid interview study which delved deeper into the issues. Results from the combined analyses of the questionnaire and interview study demonstrate that the most common forms of assessment reported by both lower and upper secondary language teachers are "observation of free oral communication", "own tests", and "essay on given topic". Elicited interview data reveal that command of grammar is ranked as the third most important criterion for assessment. This corresponds to questionnaire data about the tasks teachers use in their own language tests, where translation is common. In addition, non-language factors are reported to carry considerable weight in teachers' grading of student achievement. (As Provided)

N2  - The use of traditional art in recreational therapies is unexplored. This paper, thus, attempts to surface the unique power of traditional Filipino arts (TFA) as synergizing lens in capturing the individual and the collective experiences of a select group of Filipino elderly in an institutionalized care setting relative to their feelings of depression and self-esteem. Three Filipino elderly housed in an institutionalized care setting were chosen for this phenomenological study, a "robotfoto" and a series of semistructured interviews constitute the main data gathering tool. Field texts were subjected to phenomenological reduction via the repertory grid analysis. Emerged themes were subjected to a series of member checking procedures to ensure the trustworthiness of the reported data. Depression and self-esteem were interpreted via two emerged themes. The themes were Me, Myself, and Melancholy and Will Not Let My Worth Wither. Through recreational therapies in the form of traditional Filipino arts, participants found novel psychological crutches that overcame the challenges of depression and give them hope toward more positive views of themselves and life.

N2  - Our aim was to deepen understanding of public examinations, exploring how marking task demands influence examiners' cognition and ultimately their marking accuracy. To do this, we identified features of examinations that trigger or demand the use of cognitive marking strategies entailing "reflective" judgements. Kelly's Repertory Grid technique was used with experienced examiners to identify the most influential question features in a past international biology examination for 16 year olds. The examiners generated grids of features on which the examination questions differed. Subsequently they rated each question for each feature, using self-generated five-point scales. The questions' marking accuracies were known only to the researchers. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted. Data analysis revealed five features that are highly likely to activate "reflective" cognitive marking strategies, thereby influencing accuracy. A further five features may contribute less directly. The findings are compared with those for mathematics and physics examinations, enabling contrasts and generalisations to be made. (Contains 1 figure, 3 tables, and 1 note.) (As Provided)

N2  - The aim of this longitudinal research is to explore whether poorly organized occupational thinking contributes to school dropout. The 377 students in the sample were 15-16 years old when they participated in an evaluative study on career education. Kelly's method of measuring vocational constructs, the repertory grid technique, was used to measure gains in the organization of occupational thinking. Information on educational progress was gathered in a follow-up study 8 years later to examine, whether gains in development on vocational constructs at age 15-16 increased the likelihood of graduating from upper secondary schools. Results show effects on dropping out from gender and grades. A comparison between the groups that graduated and dropped out showed that gains in organized occupational thinking at age 15-16 predict graduation from vocational education, controlling for effects of social factors and grades.

T1  - An Investigation into Digital Media: Characteristics of Learning Objects Which K-12 Teachers Determine Meet Their Instructional Needs
A1  - Guthrie, Patricia Ann
Y1  - 2010//
Y2  - 2010//
N2  - In recent years, learning objects have emerged as an instructional tool for teachers. Digital libraries and collections provide teachers with free or fee-base access to a variety of learning objects from photos and famous speeches to Flash animations and interactive Java Applets. Learning objects offer opportunities for students to interact with digital media in ways that can bring concepts and ideas to life. Students can visualize what changes in matter might look like and practice math skills like multiplying decimals. They can even receive instant feedback and interact with tutorials as many times as needed. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to examine how K-12 teachers determine the characteristics of learning objects that meet their instructional needs. Capturing snapshots of what characteristics of learning objects that successful K-12 teachers select may lead to a clearer picture that could advance the use of learning objects in the classroom. By incorporating learning objects into their instructional practices, teachers can enhance their instruction as well as demonstrate to media savvy students how to use readily available learning objects to express and communicate what they've learned. In order to identify the characteristics of learning objects that teachers deem useful, a small sample of K-12 teachers experienced in using learning objects were interviewed using the Repertory Grid Technique. This technique is used to elicit personal constructs. In this study, a representative group of learning objects were examined to elicit constructs or characteristics about learning objects with regard to instructional use. The resulting learning object characteristics were analyzed to determine if the characteristics deemed useful by teachers are aligned to the characteristics that learning object designers use.

N2  - George Kelly's repertory grid application seems a promising method for researching the moral significance of teaching from a "life world" perspective. However, we encountered several challenges employing the repertory grid in its standard form for an inquiry into the inherent moral significance of teachers' everyday classroom interactions. In this article we will set out in detail how, on the basis of the standard repertory grid application, we developed a repertory interview method that can be used to collect data that could foster a thorough understanding of the inherent moral significance of teachers' day-to-day classroom interactions.

A1  - Harter, Stephanie Lewis
Y1  - 2010//
Y2  - 2010//
N2  - Socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen, 1995) posits a "positivity effect" in older adults, describing an increasing tendency to attend to, process, interpret, and remember events and others in life in a positive fashion as one ages. Drawing on personal construct theory, Viney (1993) observes increasing integration of constructions of self with others across the lifespan. The current study extends assessment of the positivity effect, integrating it with personal construct theory, by use of Repertory Grid (RepGrid) analysis. Consistent with the positivity effect, older adults (ages 54-86) described others more positively on RepGrid measures in comparison to younger adults (ages 18-25). Older adults also described the self as more similar to others and tended to describe the self more positively. The age groups did not differ in measures of psychological distress or well being with the exception of older adults describing more autonomy. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.) (As Provided)

Y1  - 2010//
Y2  - 2010-06//
N2  - This article describes a holistic approach to designing an introductory, object-oriented programming course. The design is grounded in constructivism and pedagogy of phenomenography. We use constructive alignment as the framework to align assessments, learning, and teaching with planned learning outcomes. We plan learning and teaching activities, and media with an understanding of variation theory and the ways in which students learn to program. We outline the implementation of the course, and discuss the findings from the first cycle of an action research study with a small sample of undergraduate students. An investigation of the preferred (deep/surface) learning approaches of the students led us to believe that these approaches can be influenced through course design. Personal constructs of the students, elicited through the repertory grid technique, revealed that rich inventories of learning resources are highly valued. We comment on the transformational processes of the experience of the participants, and identify areas for further refinement and investigation in the next action research cycle.

N2  - Previous studies have quantified the extent of usage, knowledge, and relationship of people's behavior in regard to food supplements--particularly in developed countries such as the United States. Despite the prevalence of supplements use and the issues surrounding its use, there has been little or no study of supplement use in a developing country like the Philippines. This study aimed to explore, qualitatively, the concept, motivations, and expectations of a select group of Filipino elderly relative to their use of commercialized food supplements (CFS). Five faculty extendees from a private university in the Philippines were selected in this phenomenological study. A two-part research instrument consisting of a robotfoto and a face-to-face interview guide with semistructured questions was used. Extended texts were subjected to phenomenological reduction via repertory grid analysis. Conceptual clusters that emerged were subjected to the member checking procedure for purposes of ensuring data trustworthiness. Through constant comparison of the concepts, expectations, and motivations of the respondents of the study relative to their use of CFSs, a clear-cut taxonomy of users was identified: (a) the idealist-experimentalist and (b) the realist-pragmatist. The emerged typologies in this study create a picture that can help healthcare providers understand the dynamics of patient behavior toward CFS use. Implications of the study to health education are also documented in this paper. (Contains 1 table.) (As Provided)

N2  - Background: Registered nurses (RNs) with specific knowledge and skills in the care of the aged are an important component in the delivery of quality health-care (Venturato, Kellet, & Windsor, 2006). These nurses experience both fervors of being in service and labor that challenge them, but which contribute to their provision of quality health care to elders and feelings of career satisfaction to those concerned. Objective: This qualitative study is an attempt to provide a more eiditic description of what defines the fervor and labor of a select group of geriatric nurses in The Philippines. Method: Nine geriatric nurses chosen purposively from seven nursing homes at the capital of The Philippines participated voluntarily in this qualitative study. Data were gathered from semistructured interviews and were treated via repertory grid analysis. Themes emerging in this study were subjected to the member checking procedure to ensure data trustworthiness. Findings: Interestingly, nurses' fervor toward geriatric care is uniquely characterized by three dimensions: Transactional (What is in it for me?), Transformational (What is in it for us?), and Transcendental (What is in it for life?). The use of doodles in geriatric research (de Guzman et al., 2007) has once more proven its research value when it has eiditically typified the Filipino geriatric nurses' collective views of labor under three interesting conceptual clusters such as the substantial, social, and structural. Conclusion: The work of geriatric nurses is truly authentic human service. Despite difficulties and inadequacies in their work environment, it is the nurse's burning passion to be of service to the elderly, which rendered the professional practice worth pursuing and their life filled with meaning.

N2  - The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is a process of removing metabolic waste, other poisons, and excess fluids from the blood and replacing essential blood constituents through a dialysis machine. With hemodialysis causing stress not only to physical status but also to psychological functioning and well-being, the individual will have to strive to cope with it. Coping involves cognitive and/or behavioral efforts exerted by the individual to be able to master, reduce, or tolerate the demands of a situation. Different coping strategies are being utilized by individuals such as thinking positively, having a positive outlook, and positively comparing self to others in similar situations. These techniques are what is referred to as optimistic coping. The study aims to capture the essences or languages of coping according to a select group of Filipino elderly patients with lived hemodialysis experiences. A total of 13 respondents, selected through purposive sampling, were provided with a two-part questionnaire. The first part is the robotfoto, which provides the cartographic sketch of the subjects. The second part is the semistructured interview, with an aide memoir. This is intended to surface the subjects' lived experience relative to hemodialysis experience coping mechanisms and the meaning of coping to them. Data gathered were transcribed and analyzed via cool and warm analyses. A repertory grid was constructed where significant statements were categorized and thematised revealing the languages of coping according to elderly patients with lived hemodialysis experience. Through interviews, the study yielded three themes that reveal the language of coping for Filipino geriatric patients undergoing hemodialysis. These themes consist of (a) coping as scaffolding: or the power to hold on, (b) coping as sailing: or the power to let go, and (c) coping as sanguinity: or the power to see the difference. Coping was defined as an ability (will power, acceptance, positive thinking) that people possess to keep up with certain stressful events, thereby making life more tolerable.

N2  - Spirituality is an aspect of holistic care delivery by health team members. However, despite the established relationship of spirituality and health, there had been little evidence of ways of assessing spirituality for nurses' clinical practice in Asia, particularly in regard to geriatric patients. This study aimed to establish an eiditic description of a selected group of Filipino elderly's concept of, distance from, and involvement with God. The goal was to strengthen the need for a holistic care delivery framework anchored on the recognition of spiritual well-being among geriatric patients. Seven Filipino geriatrics suffering from chronic illness participated voluntarily as respondents for this qualitative study. A three-part researcher-made instrument was used in eliciting the needed data and information. The first part of data gathering made use of a "robotfoto" to establish the demographic profile of the respondents. Doodling was utilized to ascertain the respondents' concept of God. Distance from God was assessed through a picture prompt presenting a seat plan in a theatre. A semistructured interview was employed to probe deeper into the respondents' involvement with God. Field texts were phenomenologically reduced via repertory grid and dendogram. The study has eiditically and interestingly surfaced the Filipino elderly's twin concept of God as creating and creative. Generally, the respondents' preferred a close distance from God to facilitate better understanding and higher concentration with God's words. Involvement with God portrayed a sequential process of connection coined as the Ladder to G-O-D, referring to the course of Getting involved, Outcome identification, and Deeper connection.

N2  - The continually rising percentage of the elderly population and the demand for geriatric nursing care are dramatically related. While it is true that most undergraduate programs prepare nurses for the care of geriatric patients, most receive limited academic preparation in the nursing curriculum (Williams & Mezey, 2000). This is particularly true in the Philippines where there is no stand-alone geriatric nursing course. This phenomenological study purports to capture the lived experiences of Filipino nursing students' dilemmas in geriatric care. Five Filipino senior nursing students and three clinical faculty from a comprehensive university in the Philippines were purposely chosen for the study. A two-part instrumentation was used. The first is the robotfoto, a Dutch term which means a cartographic sketch of the subject (Kelchtermans & Ballet, 2002). The second was a semi-structured face-to-face interview that was recorded with the consent of the participants. The full texts were phenomenologically reduced using a repertory grid to observe both cool and warm analyses, which facilitates the identification of unique conceptual clusters. Findings of this study have described the elements that define student dilemmas in geriatric care. The emerged Students' Dilemmas in Geriatrics Causality Quadrant (SDGCQ), which consists of (a) Foundational Deficit, (b) Psychological Deficit, (c) Relational-Attitudinal Deficit, and (d) Occupational Deficit, are valuable discussion points for needed reforms in the present-day nursing curriculum.

T1  - Why Are Some GCSE Examination Questions Harder to Mark Accurately than Others? Using Kelly's Repertory Grid Technique to Identify Relevant Question Features

N2  - It has long been established that marking accuracy in public examinations varies considerably among subjects and markers. This is unsurprising, given the diverse cognitive strategies that the marking process can entail, but what makes some questions harder to mark accurately than others? Are there distinct but subtle features of questions and their mark schemes that can affect accuracy? Such features could potentially contribute to a broad rationale for designating questions to markers according to personal expertise. The aim of this study was to identify question features that can distinguish those questions that are marked highly accurately from those that are marked less accurately. The study comprised an exploration of maths and physics questions from past GCSE examinations, which were marked in an experimental setting by groups of markers and yielded differing marking accuracies. The questions also varied in their difficulty for GCSE candidates, and in the cognitive strategies needed to mark them. Kelly's Repertory Grid technique and semi-structured interview schedules were used in meetings with highly experienced principal examiners, who had led the experimental marking of the questions. The data generated comprised ratings for each question on a number of question features (constructs). The ratings were analysed together with the marking accuracy data, enabling an investigation of possible relationships between each question feature and (i) marking accuracy, (ii) question difficulty for the candidate, and (iii) apparent cognitive marking strategy usage. For both subjects, marking accuracy was found to be related to various subject-specific question features, some of which were also related to question difficulty (for the candidate) and/or apparent marking strategy complexity. For both maths and physics, several other subject-specific question features were found to be unrelated to accuracy. Overall, the findings have potential implications for the management of markers and for question design. (Contains 53 tables and 2 notes.) (As Provided)

N2  - Personal and Professional Development (PPD) is now key to the undergraduate medical curriculum and requires provision of appropriate learning experiences. In order to achieve this, it is essential that we ascertain students' perceptions of what is important in their PPD. We required a methodological approach suitable for a large medical school, which defines constructs used by the students to describe their PPD, and is not constrained by a researcher's predetermined line of questioning. It should also quantify the saliencies of these constructs in the student population and indicate how they gauge their own PPD. The instrument should also be suitable for administration at key stages of the students' learning experience. Here we describe the first stages in developing a novel method, which fulfills these requirements. It is based on a modified self repertory grid, the "Ideal Self" Inventory. All first year students (N = 379), provided five descriptors of a "good medical student" and of a not very good medical student, which generated 1,531 "ideal" qualities. To define underlying themed constructs, 49 randomly selected descriptors, were grouped together by self selected students (n = 55), using commonly held assumptions. Frequency of item co-occurrence was tabulated by multidimensional scaling. Themed clusters of "ideal" qualities, defined by hierarchical cluster analysis, were overlaid onto the multidimensional scaling to generate a concept map. This revealed seven themed constructs; Personal Welfare, Time and Self Management Committed Work Ethic, Learning Skills, Personal Development/Reflection, Personal and Professional Conduct and Teamwork. We then analysed the 1,531 "ideal" qualities, by determining the frequency with which students used each construct and the proportion of students who used a construct at least once. Personal and Professional Conduct, Committed Work Ethic and Time and Self Management were the most frequently used, implying that they were the most salient for the first year students.

N2  - Geriatric nursing is a physically and emotionally demanding job in healthcare. It is a neglected field despite the growing population of the elderly, and the experiences of geriatric nurses are one of the unrecognized aspects of this field. This qualitative study purports to explore the successes and struggles of the lived experiences of a select group of Filipino geriatric nurses working in nursing homes. A total of five registered nurses selected from Philippine geriatric homes were the subjects of this qualitative study. Data were gathered from a two-part instrument: namely, a researcher-made robotfoto and a semistructured interview. Through the use of a repertory grid involving both cool and warm analyses, field texts were phenomenologically reduced in order to establish distinct conceptual clusters. Summarily, two roles were found to be the defining elements of Filipino geriatric care nurses' sense of success and fulfillment. These include the instrumental and developmental, which describe the nurses' appreciation of their unique place in the lives of their elderly patients and, at the same time, their experiences of personal and professional growth and expansion as nurses. In regard to their struggles, the contextual conditions in the workplace typify the roadblocks of their efficient and effective delivery of quality healthcare services. (Contains 1 table.)

N2  - Nurses play a significant role in geriatric care. However, as the aging population and demand for geriatric nurses increase worldwide, shortages of nurses seem to arise. This creates the need to assess and address the motivation and attitudes of nurses toward geriatric care. The intent of this qualitative study is to surface the essence or the "lebenswelt" that describe the motivation and attitudes of a selected group of Filipino nurses toward geriatric care. A total of six registered nurses who had experienced taking care of elderly patients voluntarily participated as respondents of this study. A two-part instrument developed by the researchers was made to elicit necessary data and information. The first part comprised of the "robotfoto" intended to establish the baseline characteristics of nurses under study. The second part consisted of a semistructured individual in-depth interview using "aide memoire" to probe into the motivation and attitudes of the nurse respondents. Field texts were phenomenologically reduced via repertory grid. Two distinct and interesting themes, namely Geriatric Service Motivation Typology and the Yin-Yang of Geriatric Attitudes emerged. The first theme includes the Single Loop and Double Loop type of motivation The former involves a transactional and unidirectional process, while the latter constitutes a two-way relational and transformational process. The second theme consists of a harmonious combination of the two sides of the nurses' attitudes toward geriatric care. Through this study, the human side of nursing is seen and captured, thus increasing the awareness and knowledge of nurses, improving provision of optimum geriatric care, and inspiring nurses to pursue geriatric nursing with a yearning to serve the elderly with and from the heart.

N2  - This study investigated the approaches to teaching by three fifth-grade teachers' of creative and non-creative mathematical problems for fractions. The teachers' personal constructs of the two kinds of problems were elicited by interviews through the use of the repertory grid technique. All the teaching was observed and video-recorded. Results revealed that the teachers had slightly distinctive constructs of creative and non-creative problems, and professed a greater preference for creative problems. Based on the teachers' creations of problems in classrooms and related features, the study identified three types of teaching approaches: liberal, reasoning, and skill approaches. The liberal approach appeared to indicate the most appropriate teaching methods for creative problems. (As Provided)

T1  - Assessing at the Borderline: Judging a Vocationally Related Portfolio Holistically
A1  - Johnson, Martin
Y1  - 2008//
Y2  - 2008//
N2  - This study investigated the cognitive strategies that underpin assessors' holistic judgments of a school-based vocationally-related portfolio performance. Using a portfolio already identified as containing borderline qualities, quantitative data were gathered about features that six assessors attended to as they holistically evaluated the portfolio. This information was gathered through verbal protocols and supplemented with information from a modified Kelly's Repertory Grid interview technique (Kelly, 1955). This elicited assessors' perceptions about the characteristics of the assessment criteria, allowing the influence of each factor to be ranked. Another objective was to collect qualitative data about the socio-contextual features in which the assessors' practices were situated. The study uses Activity Theory to explore the relationship between the factors that potentially influence assessors' judgments, suggesting a theoretical position that assessor judgments are influenced or framed within the context of their experience and differing perspectives.

T1  - Understanding What It Means for Older Students to Learn Basic Musical Skills on a Keyboard Instrument

Y2  - 2008-06//
N2  - Although many adults take up or return to instrumental and vocal tuition every year, we know very little about how they experience it. As part of ongoing case study research, eight older learners with modest keyboard skills explored what their musical skills meant to them during conversation-based repertory grid interviews. The data were categorised using simple clustering, and thematically analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA). Although this study was very small scale, findings suggest that lifelong musical experience, expectations and understanding profoundly affect adult motivation for learning a musical instrument. By choosing what to learn and how to do it, and satisfying their need for achievement, enjoyment and self-confidence, older keyboard learners can use their music learning to construct a dynamic musical identity as part of their self-fulfilment.

T1  - Attracting Generation Y Graduates: Organisational Attributes, Likelihood to Apply and Sex Differences
A1  - Terjesen, Siri

Y1  - 2007//

N2  - Purpose: Building on person-organisation fit and gender self-schema, this research aims to examine UK university final year students' perception of the importance of organisational attributes and their presence in three major graduate employers. This study also seeks to explore which organisational attributes attract Generation Y men and women to apply to a management trainee position. Design/methodology/approach: In phase one, 32 repertory grid interviews identify 84 common constructs in undergraduates' organisational choice. A short list of 20 organisational attributes was carried forward to the phase two survey of 862 undergraduates in their final year at 22 UK universities. The respondents rate the attributes in terms of importance and then evaluate three employers in terms of perceived presence of these attributes. The students also provide the likelihood that they would apply. T-tests, correlation and multiple regression are used to test hypotheses. Findings: Among university students, the five most important organisational attributes are: "invest heavily in the training and development of their employees" "care about their employees as individuals" "clear opportunities for long-term career progression" "variety in daily work" and "dynamic, forward-looking approach to their business". Sex differences exist in both the importance of organisational attributes and the perceived extent of their presence in three organisations. In describing an ideal employer, women rate eight attributes as more important than do their male counterparts: "really care about their employees as individuals" "variety in your daily work" "friendly, informal culture" "employ people with whom you feel you will have things in common" "use your degree skills" "relatively stress-free working environment" "internationally diverse mix of colleagues" "require you to work standard working hours only". Compared to women, men rate just one attribute as more important: "a very high starting salary". The perception of presence of these important attributes is significantly linked to likelihood to apply. Practical implications: Recruiting firms can better understand how Generation Y men and women graduates perceive the importance of organisational attributes and their presence in firms. Originality/value: The paper represents a seminal study relating organisational attributes to likely applicant behaviour across a large number of UK university undergraduates. (Contains 3 tables.)

Y1  - 2007//

N2  - In order to enhance teachers' professional awareness, it is necessary to understand and value their subjective or personal knowledge and beliefs. This study investigated the change of science teachers' personal knowledge about teaching models and modeling in science within the context of educational reform in The Netherlands. The study followed nine experienced science teachers during the first years of the implementation of a new syllabus, which emphasizes models and modeling. Data collection consisted of the repeated administration of a Repertory Grid instrument. From the results, three different types of personal knowledge concerning teaching models and modeling in science were identified, each of which showed significant change over time. Type 1 combined modeling as an activity undertaken by students with the learning of specific model content. In Type 2, the learning of model content was combined with critical reflection on the role and nature of models in science. Finally, in Type 3, the learning of model content involved both students' production and revision of models, and a critical examination of the nature of scientific models in general. Implications for the teachers' professional development are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 4 figures. Appended to this document is "The Rep Grid Procedure.")

Y1  - 2006//
Y2  - 2006//
N2  - This study examined the structure of two preservice teachers' understandings of educational software in mathematics using repertory grid techniques. Specifically, the study focused on how teacher educators can enable preservice teachers to discern the features of mathematics software, and develop pedagogical goals that reflect the affordances and constraints of available tools. Results showed a deepening of knowledge and a differentiation of knowledge following experiences of exploration, evaluation, and comparison of different types of software. Results imply that directing preservice teachers' attention to utilizing the functional characteristics of software for developing plans and for the design of instruction may be fruitful for more effective integration of software in their future teaching. However, participants' preexisting content knowledge and their pedagogical worldview tempered this effect. (Contains 8 figures and 2 tables.) (Author)

N2  - The new 1?9 curriculum framework in Taiwan provides a remarkable change from previous frameworks in terms of the coverage of content and the powers of teachers. This study employs a modified repertory grid technique to investigate biology teachers' preferences with regard to six curriculum components. One hundred and eighty-five in-service and pre-service biology teachers were asked to determine which science curriculum components they liked and disliked most of all to include in their biology classes. The data show that the rank order of these science curriculum components, from top to bottom, was as follows: application of science, manipulation skills, scientific concepts, social/ethical issues, problem-solving skills, and the history of science. They also showed that pre-service biology teachers, as compared with in-service biology teachers, favored problem-solving skills significantly more than manipulative skills, while in-service biology teachers, as compared with pre-service biology teachers, favored manipulative skills significantly more than problem-solving skills. Some recommendations for ensuring the successful implementation of the Taiwanese 1?9 curriculum framework are also proposed. (Author)

T1  - Reflection on Teaching and Scholarship of Teaching: Focus on Science Instructors
A1  - Kreber, Carolin
Y1  - 2005//
Y2  - 2005-09//
N2  - Reflection on teaching in higher education remains poorly understood. This exploratory study had three goals. First, to test, empirically yet in an exploratory way, the applicability of a particular model of reflection. Second, to identify objective indicators of reflection on knowledge about teaching with the intent to make the process of reflection more concrete, visible, and its outcomes valid. Third, in line with the exploratory nature of the study, to shed light on some variables that might be linked to observed differences in reflection, which could be investigated more systematically through future research. The model of reflection guiding the study was based on Mezirow's transformative learning theory. It distinguishes three kinds of reflection: on content, process and premises. These take place within three domains of knowledge about teaching: instruction, pedagogy, and curriculum. Thirty-six instructors of science participated in a semi-structured interview based on the model and completed a repertory grid, which incorporated their beliefs about teaching as identified through the Approaches of Teaching Inventory (ATI). While all instructors showed evidence of reflection that were in line with the model, differences were observed in the extent or kind of reflection they engaged in. Across all three knowledge domains, premise reflection was observed the least often. Results suggested that years of experience and beliefs about teaching might play a role in the extent to which academics are inclined to engage in reflection. The study also identified concrete indicators of reflection, which could be helpful for academic staff evaluation. (Author)

T1  - Teachers' Personal Construct Models of Pupil Individuality and their Influence in the Music Classroom
A1  - Hewitt, Allan
Y1  - 2005//
Y2  - 2005-11//
N2  - This paper reports on an investigation into the belief patterns of music teachers with regard to the nature and significance of factors of individual difference and in the context of secondary school classroom music teaching. Belief patterns were collected in the form of Personal Construct models, drawing on Kelly's Theory of Personal Constructs. The study explored both music teachers' Personal Construct models of pupil individuality and the reported significance of those models of pupil individuality for the participants' teaching approaches. The investigation of Personal Construct models concentrated on how each participant grouped the pupils they teach according to perceptions of individual difference. The belief patterns of participants were also compared. The study involved eight secondary school music teachers working in the west of Scotland. Participants' construct models were elicited using Repertory Grid technique, where pupils were the grid elements, and factors of individual difference, the constructs. The influence of models of individual difference on classroom practice was then investigated using semi-structured interviews. Three main findings from the study are discussed. First, there was considerable variation among participants in the choice of factors of individual difference believed to be significant for teaching in music, and therefore in their Personal Construct models. Second, there were notable similarities in how participants appeared to group sets of pupils within those models, even though the models themselves varied widely. Finally, Personal Construct models and specific belief patterns relating to individual differences appear to be important influences on the structure and nature of teaching in music. (Author)

N2  - Web-based peer assessment is an innovative method that can be used to assess students' learning portfolios in order to improve their learning. However, students cannot easily compare their own evaluation schemes or think reflectively to improve their learning through web-based peer assessment if they do not understand how others perceive the assessment criteria. This study attempts to utilize knowledge acquisition techniques in order to elicit personal understanding of assessment criteria. Using repertory grid analysis, web-based peer assessment systems can elucidate personal conceptual frameworks and evaluation schemes when students use their own criteria to assess learning portfolios. The analysis provides an instrument for monitoring the students' conceptual frameworks--which may lead to different peer-teacher correlations regarding assessment. This instrument allows teachers and students to understand fully each other's conceptual frameworks and evaluation schemes--thereby allowing them to think reflectively and improve their learning.

T1  - Prompting Conceptual Understanding with Computer-Mediated Peer Discourse and Knowledge Acquisition Techniques
A1  - Liu, Chen-Chung
A1  - Lee, Jia-Hsung
Y1  - 2005//
Y2  - 2005-09//
N2  - Numerous computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools have been designed to facilitate group discourses on the Web. However, previous studies noted that participants did not value online conferencing as a method for conducting in-depth discussions, and instead considered this method as merely scratching the surface of the issues involved. Therefore, the teachers must moderate the online discourse to add value to the success of CMC. This study presents a methodology that uses knowledge acquisition techniques during online discourses to increase student conceptual understanding and evaluation skills. The methodology explains the conceptual frameworks of individuals and the conceptual relationships between student peers. Active database triggers then are applied to automatically monitor the conceptual relationships and to moderate online discourses between student peers. Student reactions demonstrated that discourses mediated by the repertory grid analysis technique helped group members not only promote common conceptual understandings but also to approach the level of conceptual understanding of the teacher.

T1  - Inferential Statistics: Understanding Expert Knowledge and Its Implications for Statistics Education

Y1  - 2004//
Y2  - 2004-07//
N2  - This study investigated the knowledge base necessary for choosing appropriate statistical techniques in applied research. In this study, we compared knowledge used by six experts and six novices in two types of statistical tasks. The tasks were: 1) comparing research scenarios from the perspective of choosing a statistical technique, and 2) direct comparison of statistical techniques. The framework was based on expert knowledge in inferential statistics using the repertory grid technique for data collection. A qualitative analysis of data showed that of the three types of expert knowledge, research design knowledge comprised the biggest portion, with theoretical and procedural knowledge comprising relatively smaller parts. Little difference was observed between experts and novices in extensiveness of knowledge use, although experts' knowledge use was found to be more integrated than novices'. Finally, two implications were drawn regarding how to better teach selection skills in statistics education: (1) statistical techniques should be taught in relation to relevant research designs, and (2) conceptual connections between statistical techniques should be explicitly taught.

T1  - The Use of Repertory Grid Analysis and Importance-Performance Analysis to Identify Determinant Attributes of Universities
A1  - Pike, Steven
Y1  - 2004//
Y2  - 2004//
N2  - In the increasingly competitive Australian tertiary education market, a consumer orientation is essential. This is particularly so for small regional campuses that compete with larger universities in the state capitals. Campus management needs to carefully monitor both the perceptions of prospective students within the catchment area, and the (dis)satisfaction levels of current students. This study reports the results of an exploratory investigation into the perceptions held of a small regional campus, using two techniques that have arguably been underutilized in the education marketing literature. Repertory Grid Analysis, a technique developed fifty years ago, was used to identify attributes deemed salient to year 12 high school students at the time they were applying for university places. Importance-performance analysis (IPA), developed three decades ago, was then used to identify attributes that were determinant for a new cohort of first year undergraduate students. The paper concludes that group applications of Repertory Grid offer education market researchers a useful technique for identifying attributes used by high school students to differentiate universities; and that IPA is a useful technique for guiding promotional decision making. In this case the two techniques provided a quick, economical and effective snapshot of market perceptions, which can be used as a foundation for the development of an ongoing market research program. Practical steps for such a program are summarized. (Contains 3 figures and 3 tables.) (As Provided)

T1  - A Constructivist Model for Evaluating Postgraduate Supervision: A Case Study
A1  - Zuber-Skerritt, Ortrun
A1  - Roche, Val
Y1  - 2004//
Y2  - 2004//
N2  - This paper presents a new constructivist model of knowledge development in a case study that illustrates how a group of postgraduate students defined and evaluated effective postgraduate supervision. This new model is based on "personal construct theory" and "repertory grid technology" which is combined with interviews and group discussion. It is argued that this approach leads to a more meaningful interpretation of results and facilitates formative evaluation and professional development of supervisors. In this case study we discuss details of our evaluation method and its benefits and limitations. We explain how this approach enables both supervisors and students to participate actively in research and development activities, to develop their own constructs or theories of effective supervision, and to communicate their suggestions for improvement. Further applications of this constructivist model to postgraduate supervision practice and to research in higher education are suggested. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.) (As Provided)

N2  - This study follows from a previous study into children's attitudes to writing test stimulus features. In that study the views of 192 English eleven-year-olds were surveyed using a questionnaire. The survey found that the children were mainly influenced by features that they felt contributed to task difficulty. A qualitative study was designed in order to investigate children's views in more depth. Stimuli were constructed containing various features that children in the earlier study had suggested contributed to task difficulty. The children's ideas relating to the stimuli were elicited using a modified version of Kelly's repertory grid technique. (Author)

Y2  - 2004-08//
N2  - This article reports on the use of a repertory grid as a tool for studying conceptual systems in line with Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory. Using 7-point construct continua, students rated the positions of major developmental theorists on various bipolar constructs (e.g., nature-nurture, continuity-discontinuity) representing salient developmental issues. The results of objective testing, combined with the findings from a brief survey of students' attitudes toward repertory grid assignments, indicated that a repertory grid is a useful pedagogical strategy in terms of organizing course content, encouraging students' conceptual understanding, and challenging students intellectually. Moreover, when conjoined with the opportunity for classroom discussion, this technique stimulates active participation in the learning process. (Author)

N2  - This study examines the curriculum components in biology favoured by high school students in Taiwan. Our sample consisted of 155 senior high school students (51 boys and 104 girls) and 137 junior high school students (74 boys and 63 girls). The questionnaire was based on the idea of a repertory grid technique and was developed to investigate the relative status of the curriculum components as perceived by the students. Descriptive statistics and t-tests were then used to analyse the data. It was found that the students favoured the curriculum components in the following order: Manipulative skills, Scientific concepts, the Application of science, Social issues, Problem solving skills and the History of science. Further comparisons indicated that there were some differences between senior high school students and junior high school students as well as between boys and girls. These findings provide us with aspects that should be seriously considered when developing curricula. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.) (As Provided)

T1  - Development of Personal Constructs about Mathematical Tasks--A Qualitative Study Using Repertory Grid Methodology

Y1  - 2003//
Y2  - 2003-07//
N2  - We can fill the gap between theory (of ambitious teacher education) and practice (in mathematics classrooms) more easily, when we take into account that teacher education is not only explicit acquisition of knowledge and methods but also development of individual personal constructs of mathematics and mathematics education. But how can we get knowledge about the development of individual implicit theories of teacher students? In this article, we propose a method to explore teacher students' individual conceptions about learning and teaching mathematics. It is based on Kelly's personal construct theory and uses repertory grid methodology for data collection as well as formal concept analysis for data analysis. The method was applied in a qualitative evaluation study of a pre-service teacher course in Darmstadt. (Contains 5 figures.) [For complete proceedings, see ED500860.] (Author)

N2  - Repertory grid analysis of data from 336 Australian career and vocational teachers and other teachers revealed how they constructed meaning for career-vocational education (CVE). Interviews and questionnaires indicated that CVE lacked status in schools. A causal model was developed to show that institutionalization of CVE resulted from personal meaning construction and individual and organizational assimilation factors. (SK)

N2  - Studied the use of the Repertory Grid in analyzing the personal constructs of 12 elementary school teachers in Spain regarding the characteristics of teachers with different levels of experience. Results reveal more similarities than differences about the principles of reform in Spanish education. Differences identified between experienced and novice teachers were mostly related to teaching methods. (SLD)

T1  - Repertory Grid Technique in Early Childhood as a Tool for Reflective Conversations in Arts Education.
A1  - Karppinen, Seija
Y1  - 2000//
Y2  - 2000-09//
N2  - The repertory grid is a technique used in psychological and behavioral studies to elicit individuals' personal constructs. This pilot study examined the feasibility of using this technique with young children in early childhood education settings with regard to visual art education, based on the view that listening to, and appreciating children's opinions and criteria about their own work and that of others is essential to understanding why children's work is the way it is. Repertory Grid offers a more structural basis for conversation and feedback in art education than does an open interview. Participating in the pilot study were two 5-year-olds. One feedback conversation was held with each child separately, as well as one unusable conversation with both children together, to elicit their constructs. During the conversations, 5 art works (elements) were selected from about 10 the child had made at home or at art school within the preceding 6 months. Constructs (product quality or action) were elicited from the child and were used to compose a grid in which all elements were allotted to constructs, using graded scales. Findings of the study indicated that the time needed for intensive conversation with young children is at most 20 minutes, breaks are needed to support and maintain motivation, the role of children's linguistic ability is crucial, and extra incentives may be needed to maintain interest.

Y1  - 2000//

N2  - F. A. Korthagen and J. P. A. Kessels (1999) advocate the adoption of the realistic approach for teacher education. The realistic approach provides developing teachers with experiences that call into question the adequacy of their beliefs. When the developing teachers are in a state of flux, the approach both supports reflection for refined perception and offers relevant conceptual knowledge for increased awareness and decision-making power. One preservice teacher was enrolled in such a realistic teacher preparation program and participated in a study which used George Kelly's (1963) repertory grid technique and complementary methods to reveal the "internal dialogue" (J. Goodman, 1988) of belief change. This narrative account traces the preservice teacher's paradigm shift from an authoritarian stance to an authoritative stance that acknowledged the possibility of a complete facilitator role.

T1  - Student Teachers' Transcending the Limits of Their Past: Repertory Grid Framing Narratives for Learning To Teach.
A1  - Hopper, T F
Y1  - 2000//
Y2  - 2000-04//
N2  - This paper explains the use in teacher preparation of a psychoanalytical tool called the repertory grid, examining how the grid has been successfully integrated into physical education teacher preparation courses. Within the process reported here, student teachers engaged in semi-autobiographical reflection on the roots of their personal beliefs and knowledge about teaching physical education. Findings from studies using this approach suggest a postmodern perspective on knowing teaching based on individuals' relational quality to a context. This relational quality allows student teachers to acknowledge an evolving, changing perspective on the complexity of teaching. Such an acknowledgement enables them to transcend the limits of their biographies of being taught as they develop competence and resourcefulness within their communities of teaching. This paper demonstrates the process of developing and re-rating a repertory grid. Data from one student teacher's conversation on interpreting the grid are offered to show how the grid enables student teachers to frame and re-frame their relational quality to their practice in schools. A general review is given of emerging findings from 70 student teachers who have used the repertory grid process. (Contains 24 references.) (SM)

Y1  - 1998//
Y2  - 1998//
N2  - This study employed the repertory grid technique to investigate how a sample of 27 student teachers in Hong Kong developed a personal sense of teaching efficacy. The analysis indicated that third-year students' perceptions were more homogeneous than were those of first-year students. The results also indicated that teaching efficacy was viewed in terms of the dimensions of concern for instructional participation and learning needs of students, communication and relationships with students, academic knowledge and teaching skills, lesson preparation, management of class discipline, teaching success, teaching commitment, and a sense of self-confidence. Experiences of teaching practice, electives, students, and teaching practice supervisors (electives) were the major sources for the development of a sense of teaching efficacy. Implications of how these aspects of teacher training can be more effective in engendering a sense of efficacy in student teachers are discussed. (Contains 46 references.) (Author/SM)

T1  - Undergraduate Data Mining on the World Wide Web.
A1  - Scime, Anthony
Y1  - 1998//
Y2  - 1998//
N2  - Currently available World Wide Web search engines determine a site's qualification as a response to a search request by matching keywords in the request to keywords representing the site. The returned sites are given a score and ranked according to the match on keywords. Many of these retrieved sites can be irrelevant to the user's true information needs. Undergraduate students with information retrieval and computer literacy skills should be able to search the Web to find and extract information relevant to a domain. A course in the fundamentals of information gathering from distributed heterogeneous sites can improve these skills. The course described in this paper examines methods, theories, and techniques and provides practice in information retrieval, categorization, and knowledge discovery from text and other unstructured data sources such as the Internet and World Wide Web. This paper reports on the results of the course and the experiences gained. Highlights include: course objectives; assignments; the research paper search architecture; outlining the research paper; Web data mining; Web site evaluation, including syntactic and semantic methods, as well as computing overall relevance using a repertory grid; design of a "data warehouse," i.e., a subject-specific relational database of highly ranked documents; knowledge discovery from the data warehouse; and writing the research paper.

T1  - Learning To Change. A Resource for Trainers, Managers and Learners Based on Self-Organised Learning.
A1  - Harri-Augstein, Sheila
A1  - Webb, Ian M
Y1  - 1995//
Y2  - 1995//
N2  - This publication shows step-by-step how trainers may use self-organized learning (SOL) to achieve real and lasting change within an organization at all levels. Each of the eight chapters begins with an "agenda board" outlining the contents and ends with a section featuring suggested activities for developing the skills. An introduction explores how SOL relates to training. Chapter 1 defines SOL and covers benefits to individuals, teams, and organizations. Chapter 2 challenges personal and professional myths about learning. Suggested activities help increase understanding of how personal myths can affect learning. Chapter 3 uses the repertory grid as a tool to model the learning process. Chapter 4 introduces a process-based language for developing learning conversations and describes its overall form. Chapter 5 introduces the personal learning contract (PLC) as a major learning tool. Chapter 6 illustrates PLCs by presenting examples of "real life" applications. Chapter 7 introduces a "conversational evaluation model" to assess the effectiveness of learning and suggests a framework for measuring progress in SOL called the personal learning biography. Chapter 8 elaborates on the development of a learning system involving a learning manager and learning coaches and the setting up of learning networks among staff. Appendixes include an example feedback-for-learning package, examples of PLC and grid forms, and an index. Contains 47 references. (YLB)

T1  - The Repertory Grid as a Qualitative Interviewing Technique for Use in Survey Development.

Y1  - 1997//
Y2  - 1997-03//
N2  - The Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) is an interviewing and measurement strategy that originated as a methodological component of the Personal Construct Theory of G. Kelly (1955). Because the RGT focuses on internal processes, it can enhance a key informant interview in that the comparisons it requires the respondent to make stimulate connections and offer insights that represent meaningful perceptions and values. Kelly's theory defines personal constructs as the ways in which individuals create templates or patterns in an attempt to make sense of the realities of the world. The RGT is a measurement system designed to elicit the personal construct system. It is useful in survey construction as the grid is constructed. An application of the RGT approach to survey development is presented in the analysis of 189 responses of 26 administrators, teachers, and parents in an evaluation of Head Start programs. Ninety-four codes were established for these responses, which were grouped in to five domains. Making the grid is a complex sorting task in which elements are judged successively on a set of bipolar constructs, so that the grid becomes a multidimensional overlay of elements onto constructs. An appendix contains the rating sheet used for the grid. (Contains two figures and six references.) (SLD)

N2  - This paper presents results from a number of trials of a new approach in assessing student conceptions in physics and changes in these conceptions over time. The goal was to explore the potential of Personal Construct Psychology and its central tool, Repertory Grid Technique, to aid in the diagnosis of learner difficulties and eventually the prescription of instructional interventions in science education. The Repertory Grid traces a portrait of the set of an individual's constructs with respect to a given set of elements. It can be used in a computerized form in which an individual identifies distinguishing elements of constructs. The feasibility of the technique in studying physics was evaluated with three subjects of varying expertise (a college student, a college teacher, and a doctoral student in physics). This preliminary study led to trying the technique with a high school student who assembled five grids to reveal concept understanding. A second trial with seven students also supported the usefulness of the approach in revealing deficits in students' conceptual understandings. (Contains 7 grid figures and 26 references.) (SLD)

T1  - How Do My Students Believe They Learn?
A1  - Cunliffe, Annette
Y1  - 1995//
Y2  - 1995-09//
N2  - Teachers who attempt to promote metacognitive learning strategies in their pupils usually encounter resistance because the pupils believe that they should be instructed by a teacher. One step in overcoming such resistance is to help students to recognize and discuss their implicit views. This document describes a repertory grid which can be used to facilitate this process. The most common form of the grid uses a triadic method in which the person is asked to decide which two of three elements of roughly the same class resemble each other more than they do the third element. The repertory grid presented in this document was devised in an effort to find out how Australian students judge or construe the value of various teaching approaches as to whether they help them learn science well and was pilot tested with a small sample of students of different ages. The strategies used by the students provided useful information about the constructs they were using to judge valuable learning activities. Elicitation of the grids and discussion with the individual students showed that they all saw activities which demanded more personal involvement as helping them learn science better. (JRH)

T1  - How Do Science Teachers Become Professionals? Implications of Case Studies of Two Beginning Teachers.
A1  - Cunliffe, Annette
Y1  - 1994//
Y2  - 1994-07//
N2  - A longitudinal case study was conducted to explore changes in how beginning science teachers conceptualize science teaching. The current study explored the development of two of these teachers who were chosen because of their contrasting levels of expertise after their first semester of independent teaching. The research was designed to elicit the participants' personal beliefs about science teaching and science teachers. Three data collection methods, concept mapping, a repertory grid interview technique and stimulated recall interviews were used to allow triangulation. Data were collected as early as possible in the preservice year, at the end of that year and after one and three semesters of independent teaching. The initial stimulated recall interview for each participant occurred during the first continuous 3-week teaching experience. Findings raised questions about possible implications for selection, preservice education, and induction of science teachers to enhance the quality of the contribution of new members of the profession. Appendixes show the frequencies of comments in different categories in each stimulated recall interview, the focused forms of each repertory grid, and concept maps drawn at each stage.

T1  - Teachers' vs. Students' Beliefs Regarding Intrinsic Motivation in the Mathematics Classroom: A Personal Constructs Approach.
A1  - Middleton, James A
Y1  - 1992//
Y2  - 1992-04//
N1  - Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (San Francisco, CA, April 22, 1992).
N2  - The relationship between teachers' and students' personal constructs regarding intrinsic motivation in the mathematics class were examined in this study. Participants were six middle-school mathematics teachers and 30 students from 5 classes. Videotape, direct observation, individual interviews, and repertory grid tasks focused on the ways in which teachers attempted to build their students' motivations into their lessons, and the belief systems of teachers vs. students. Recent mathematics activities for each class served as elements for construct elicitation in the repertory grid task. Teachers and students were presented with random pairs of activities and were asked to determine what made one activity more fun than the other. Responses (constructs) were entered into a computer program that paired each activity with each construct and asked participants to rate how well each construct described each activity. Results revealed that the individuals studied whether teachers or students were similar in their construct systems. Despite the similarities, the differences that were apparent seem to be problematic to the extent to which teachers can anticipate the motivation of their students. Teachers did pay attention to motivating their students in developing their lesson plans, but the ways in which they attempted to build motivating exercises seemed to be more dependent upon the teachers' personal conceptions of intrinsic motivation than their beliefs about their students. Most of the studied teachers had little notion of the motivational beliefs of their students. Teachers' and students' cognitive organization of construct supported the model proposed by Middleton, Littlefield, and Lehrer (1992). Both students and teachers tended to stress the interrelationship between arousal and control levels in determining the intrinsic motivation of mathematics activities. Results are examined in relation to the need to inform teachers regarding the dynamics of student motivation, and to pay particular attention to the individual differences in students' motivational beliefs. In general, results indicate that when teachers are able to predict their students' beliefs, they are better able to fine tune their instruction to turn kids on to mathematics.

T1  - Action Research in Higher Education: Examples and Reflections.
A1  - Zuber-Skerritt, Ortrun
Y1  - 1992//
Y2  - 1992//
N2  - This book presents a series of case studies in higher education which demonstrate how teams of academics have improved their practice, skill and conditions of learning and teaching through "action research." Action research is defined as collaborative critical enquiry by academics themselves into their own teaching practice, into problems of student learning and into curriculum problems. The book is structured in three main parts: action research in higher education, examples of action research, and reflections on action research, respectively. Chapter 1 describes the characteristics of action research and of some of the theoretical assumption underlying the processes and procedures. Chapter 2 argues that student learning skills need to be developed systematically by the teachers in higher education and integrated into students' academic programmes as a normal, ongoing learning activity. Chapter 3 argues for the systematic development and integration of student research skills in postgraduate programs. Chapter 4 introduces a research methodology in higher education. Chapter 5 uses the repertory grid technology developed in the previous chapter to elicit personal constructs of professional development from those academics who participated in action research projects described in earlier chapters. Chapter 6 offers personal reflections of the author, a consultant in higher education. (Author/JB)

T1  - Toward a Model of Knowledge Structure and a Comparative Analysis of Knowledge Structure Measurement Techniques.
A1  - Koubek, Richard J

Y1  - 1991//

N2  - A proposed model of human knowledge structure was studied, beginning with an operational definition of knowledge structure. A battery of available knowledge structure measurement techniques was used to detect structure differences between two experience level groups in the domain of clerical work. Subjects were 15 experienced secretaries and 15 secretaries with no more than 1 year of secretarial experience. Techniques used included card sorting, hierarchical clustering analysis, repertory grid, multidimensional scaling, Pathfinder, and pairwise similarity ratings. Subjects performed the standard tasks associated with each measurement technique. Results validate the existence of all model dimensions. Two dimensions were affected by experience level, and post hoc analysis revealed that an additional dimension, structure complexity, is a function of experience level differences, and should be included in future model development. The capabilities of the measurement techniques differed. Hierarchical clustering analysis was the most effective technique for detecting structure differences between the subject groups. In refining the proposed model, new knowledge structure measurement methodologies should be developed to provide a more comprehensive examination of the important parameters. An 83-item list of references is included. Six figures and three tables present study data. (Author/SLD)

N2  - Preservice teachers' beliefs about effective teachers were examined with the repertory grid technique. Second- and fourth-year preservice teachers (N=22) were randomly selected to participate in a computerized repertory grid exercise. The computer program led the subjects through a series of steps that allowed them to compare and contrast the characteristics of teachers that they had identified. Subjects' responses were factor-analyzed by the computer program. Students were then given a chart that summarized their ideas about characteristics of good teachers and were asked to complete a questionnaire about their interpretations of this summary. Some qualitative differences between the responses of second- and fourth-year students are reported. Implications for further research are discussed. (Author/IAH)

Y1  - 1989//
Y2  - 1989//
N2  - A great deal of work has been accomplished over the past several years on children's conceptualizations of various scientific phenomena. A problem, however, is determining whether one's collection techniques provide a complete picture. In this study three techniques (the repertory grid, draw and describe, and the interview about events) were used to collect information on children's concepts of the seasons. Twenty-four fourth graders were included in this study. Eight children were interviewed using this technique. The relationship of "life-world knowledge" and "scientific knowledge" was critical in this study since seasons can be approached from the direction of scientific explanations or cultural events and celebrations. The results of this study indicated that the repertory grid technique provided more of a science knowledge view, the draw and describe technique provided more of a cultural view, and the interview about events technique corresponded well with both the cultural and scientific views. The results suggest a relationship between school science and school social studies and may support the current Science-Technology-Society emphasis. (CW)

N1  - Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (New Orleans, LA, April, 1988). Charts may not reproduce well.
N2  - Repertory grid technique and extensive interviews were used to investigate the personal constructs of mathematics and mathematics teaching held by four preservice secondary mathematics teachers. Kelly's Personal Construct Theory and Perry's developmental scheme provided frameworks for analysis of the experiential, pedagogical, and mathematical perspectives through which the preservice teachers interpreted their undergraduate teacher preparation programs and anticipated their roles as teachers. Mathematical constructs tended to focus on simple algorithmic exercises guided by personal success with pre-college mathematics. Participants generally evidenced neither constructs with which to assimilate the implications of higher mathematics nor the anticipatory schema to deem such material relevant. Role constructs tended to focus on social, versus intellectual, qualities. (PK)

T1  - What Children Bring to Light: A Study of Personal Orientation to Science Learning.
A1  - Shapiro, Bonnie L
Y1  - 1987//
Y2  - 1987//
N2  - This study develops and employs the construct, personal orientation to science learning, to study the processes by which children construct meaning as they learn science in school. The theoretical bases of the thesis are the commitments of a constructivist view of learning and the psychological framework of George Kelly's Personal Construct Theory. Methods appropriate to these theoretical foundations were used in the collection of information. These were: participant observation; a dialogical approach; an attitude of sensitive listening; stimulated video recall; and an adaptation of Kelly's Repertory Grid Test. Ongoing evaluation of idea development was also conducted with the six fifth-grade children in a selected study group and with the students in the classroom as a whole. Themes of personal orientation to learning emerged in the analysis of data and were used to revisit each child's science learning experiences. Guidance is offered for teachers interested in a serious consideration of the meaning of a constructivist view of the learner in the classroom. Suggestions are also made to assist teachers in the selection of experiences and curricula which will help students to become aware of their own orientations to science learning and how they might take greater responsibility for their own learning.

Y1  - 1987//
Y2  - 1987-08//
N2  - This study explored variations in the meaning and psychological dimensions of achievement among people of different ages, sexes, and cultures. Subjects were 504 male and female British and Chinese students aged 13-55 in Hong Kong. Repertory grid technique was used to elicit success situations and related constructs. A group grid was then constructed and administered to the subjects. Results revealed two major types of achievement situations (affiliative and individualistic/competitive) and three major dimensions of achievement (outcome/emotional state, instrumental activity, and causal attribution). While these dimensions were the same for all, significant differences were found between groups on importance attached to success situations. Overall, success in family social life appeared to be the most important category of success for all, although British females perceived this category to be more important than did male subjects. Results suggest that affiliative goals may be more important among westerners than has been stated in the literature. Effort, self-control, hard work, industriousness, and ability were related to achievement for all groups suggesting that these might be universal human values, and not necessarily the Protestant work ethic.

N2  - Examined changes in individual construing processes for students in British institutes of higher learning, with reference to T-group or experiential learning group outcomes.

Y1  - 1987//
Y2  - 1987//
N1  - Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (Washington, DC, April 20-24, 1987).
N2  - An intensive case study of two student teachers focused on how their beliefs and practices developed during the student teaching experience. Ethnographic methods used included participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and analysis of journals kept by the student teachers. The Kelly Repertory Grid Technique was used to examine the beliefs of the student teacher both before and after the student teaching experience. This paper presents detailed findings concerning both student teachers. Several important hypotheses worthy of further research that involve student teachers' idiosyncratic beliefs, how beliefs change over the student teaching experience, philosophical views and educational beliefs of student teachers, and how beliefs guide the student teacher during actual practice are listed.

T1  - The Role of Beliefs in the Practice of Teaching: Final Report of the Teacher Beliefs Study.
A1  - Nespor, Jan K
Y1  - 1985//
Y2  - 1985-01//
N2  - This report summarizes the conceptual framework, findings, and methods of the Teacher Beliefs Study, an intensive, two-year program of research on the structures and functions of teachers' belief systems. Eight teachers in three school districts were videotaped over the course of a semester and were interviewed for a total of approximately 20 hours (using a variety of techniques, including stimulated recall and "repertory grid" interview techniques). The first chapter of the report develops a conceptual framework for the analysis of beliefs, drawing on recent research on the nature of cognition in complex or "entangled" environments. The second chapter describes the contexts of the three schools in which the teachers were observed, and discusses the possible implications of these settings for teachers' practices. The third chapter presents a set of eight case studies describing the nature and operations of a core set of the beliefs of the teachers in the sample. Chapter four then speculates on the implications of the findings for future research and teacher education practice. Methodology is discussed in three appendices. A 10-page list of references concludes the document. (Author/JD)

A1  - Walker, Rena M

Y1  - 1985//
Y2  - 1985-10//
N1  - Paper presented at the Meeting of the Rocky Mountain Educational Research Association (Law Cruces, NM, October 23-25, 1985).
N2  - Construct systems and style preferences of 30 student teachers were investigated before and after student teaching using Gregorc's (1982) "Style Delineator" and Kelly's (1955) "Repgrid". The majority of student teachers were found to prefer styles of Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random. Constructs were elicited from students as they compared and contrasted different teacher role types (e.g., Best Teacher, Most Understanding). The "Planet" computer program (Shaw, 1982) was utilized to determine similar patterns and relationships that existed in the subjects' construct systems. As predicted, students whose style preference was Concrete Sequential had a tendency to rate all the teachers with negative or positive characteristics the same on the repertory grid. An analysis of the constructs revealed categories of: personal traits, teaching qualities, and techniques. Shifts in styles were found to have corresponding changes in underlying cognitive structures. Awareness of style types and cognitive structures appears to need further research and consideration for inclusion in teacher education practices. (Author)

The students' reactions to course content were measured on a pre- and post-course questionnaire, and their perceptions of the teachers were measured with a repertory grid technique eliciting comparisons of constructs as they related to the three teachers and six other students. The use of this research method was not found to present any new problems. (MSE)

T1  - Construct Systems of Seventh-Grade Students and Their Relationships to Reading Achievement.
A1  - Walker, Rena M
Y1  - 1984//
Y2  - 1984//
N2  - A study was conducted to examine students' reading difficulties from a metacognitive perspective by considering the content of their awareness and the control they demonstrated over that awareness as they reflected on similarities and differences in various types of reading materials. Subjects were 35 seventh grade students representing seven different achievement levels on the reading comprehension and vocabulary subtests of a standardized achievement test. The repertory grid technique devised by G. A. Kelly was used to elicit subjects' constructs about nine different types of reading materials (including advertisements, maps, and storybooks) that represented different purposes and comprehension levels and offered chances for subjects to construe both surface and deep level structures. Significant differences were found on the number of deep level constructs among the low, middle, and high ability groups. Although high achievers used more deep level constructs that were elaborated and refined, they did not reduce their number of surface or low level constructs. Cluster patterns representing the organization of materials according to similarity of reading purposes were found in a moderate degree at the middle achievement levels; however, complexity cluster organization, construction, and integration were evident only in the highest level. The 10 content categories that emerged from the constructs were highly similar for all achievement levels. The report includes a five-page list of references. (FL)

T1  - Microcomputers and the Classroom Order.
A1  - Olson, John K
Y1  - 1984//
Y2  - 1984-04//
N2  - A preliminary case study used repertory grid and stimulated recall techniques to examine how teachers make sense of the impact of microcomputers on their work. Emphasis was on how teachers construe their classroom influence in relation to the actual use of microcomputers and to idealizations of their use. A version of the Kelly (1955) repgrid was used with two teachers who, in interviews, completed a projective-type test using their own constructions. Constructs were elicited by having teachers group 30 microcomputer situations and evaluate each situation in relation to each construct. Five constructs were provided and approximately five elicted to obtain a grid which was analyzed as a basis for developing a follow-up interview protocol. This report includes a review of related literature, a description of the general research methodology and specific strategies, examples of data collected from one teacher, a description of data analysis techniques, and preliminary results. Figures and tables include a list of events used as elements in construct elicitation, an example of a completed grid, an interview protocol, and a transcript of a conversation with a teacher regarding the situations. Examples illustrate the kind of data that emerge from the interview protocols based on grid analysis. Seventeen references are listed. (LMM)

T1  - Tapping Teacher Thinking through Triangulation of Data Sets. R&D Rep. No. 8014.
A1  - Morine-Dershimer, Greta
Y1  - 1983//
Y2  - 1983-06//
N2  - Validity is a central issue in use of self-report data for the investigation of teacher thinking. "Triangulation," or use of several data sets to test, corroborate and elaborate each other, is one method for increasing validity of findings. This paper illustrates a process of triangulation of data obtained by three different data collection procedures: stimulated recall interviews; Kelly Repertory Grid interviews; and ethnographic observations of classroom interaction. Comparative case studies of two junior high school teachers are presented, and data are analyzed to provide information on teachers' cognitive processes and beliefs. Two new procedures for analyzing stimulated recall data are introduced. Starting with the stimulated recall data, each data set is examined in turn, and initial findings are tested, extended, and revised with the addition of each new data set. The potential power of the triangulation method is demonstrated, and potential problems are identified. (Author)

T1  - Research into Teachers' and Student Teachers' Cognitions: Exploring the Nature of Classroom Practice.
A1  - Calderhead, James
Y1  - 1983//
Y2  - 1983-04//
N1  - Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (Montreal, Canada, April 11-14, 1983).
N2  - In order to compare the differences in cognitions of experienced and beginning teachers, the perceptions of six experienced teachers, six student teachers, and six probationer teachers (in their first year of teaching after college training) were studied at various times during the course of a school year, using a variety of methods (interview, repertory grid techniques, and stimulated recall commentaries on parts of lessons involving interaction with individual pupils or small groups). The findings from this exploratory work suggest that teachers possess qualitatively different types of information about pupils. Some types of information appear to be more useful to teachers in some contexts than others, although different types of information are often combined to guide their classroom actions. Teachers' perceptions can be classified into four major categories: (1) knowledge about pupils in general; (2) general knowledge about particular pupils; (3) specific knowledge about pupils; and (4) knowledge related to diagnostic/remediation routines. When comparing experienced teachers' knowledge with that of student teachers and probationer teachers, it seems that beginning teachers start out with very little of any of these types of knowledge. The type of knowledge that student and probationer teachers acquired most rapidly was general knowledge about particular children. (JM)

Y1  - 1983//
Y2  - 1983-04//
N2  - This qualitative study sought information about the content, nature, and diversity of teachers' beliefs and principles. Selected studies involving the beliefs of teachers in the areas of curriculum theory and innovation, decision making and thinking, and improving teaching are discussed and analyzed. A discussion of the study's methodology points out that there are numerous problems in obtaining information in an area which is by nature somewhat elusive. An established methodology, the Repertory Grid Technique, developed by G. A. Kelly in 1955, is described. Detailed discussion is presented of 4 of 14 middle school teachers' interview responses. The Repertory Grid developed from interviews with one teacher is displayed. Some generalized conclusions are drawn on the efficacy of the Repertory Grid Technique in research of this kind and on its possible value in determining teachers' points of view. (JD)

T1  - Culture and Constructs: Communicating Attitudes and Values in the Foreign Language Classroom.
A1  - Kramsch, Claire J
Y1  - 1981//
Y2  - 1981-11//
N1  - Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (Denver, CO, November 23-26, 1981).
N2  - Cross-cultural communication cannot be achieved if students are only presented with cultural facts. Instruction must involve the affective and cognitive processes of the learner in interpreting these facts. Before students can understand the attitudes and values of a foreign culture, they must be aware of their own attitudes and values in interpreting foreign events. The paper discusses the design of classroom exercises and activities to clarify the attitudes and values underlying cultural facts. The bridges for understanding other cultures do not exist at the level of one's personal constructs of those events. The teacher's task is to make these constructs apparent and observable to students without putting them on the defensive or reinforcing stereotypes. One method for accomplishing this is through the use of a repertory grid which shows how different people from different cultures construe the same events differently. Classroom exercises for establishing a common ground of shared experiences aim at construing the experiences of another person together with one's own. (JK)

Y1  - 1981//
Y2  - 1981-08//
N1  - Paper presented at the International Congress on Personal Construct Psychology (4th, Ontario, Canada, August 24-28, 1981).
N2  - A pilot study into adult learners' perceptions of adult learning was undertaken in early 1980 at Adelaide College of the Arts and Education (Australia). The research set out to explore whether there are underlying dimensions which adult learners use in evaluating and comparing learning experiences. Five volunteer subjects completed Kolb's Learning Style Inventory and a Kelly Repertory Grid with both elements and constructs being elicited. The grids were subjected to Slater's INGRID program and to Shaw's FOCUS program. It was found that while there are some shared constructs about adult learning, there are also many unique and idiosyncratic dimensions. It is argued that some sort of exploratory dialogue both about the teaching/learning situation itself, and about the subject being studied, may be an appropriate starting point when working with a group of adult learners.

T1  - Dynamics of Promotion Decisions.
A1  - Rix, Elizabeth Ann
Y1  - 1981//
Y2  - 1981-04//
N2  - This study attempted to identify the criteria educational administrators use when selecting individuals for promotion. Researchers compared "operative criteria" (those actually used) with "posted criteria" (those espoused). Interviews were conducted with 92 school administrators. Brown's Form PROM, derived from Kelly's role construct repertory grid, was the instrument used. Administrators were asked to list general criteria important in selecting employees for promotion and then criteria they had actually used in selecting individuals for promotion. The most important criteria to emerge were (1) perceptiveness and intelligence, (2) self-others orientation, (3) decision-making skills, and (4) innovation and flexibility. Findings indicate that administrators in more senior positions use cognitively more complex structures for discrimination among persons and moreover, that those using more complex structures make more valid decisions, at least in so far as their operative criteria are congruent with their posted criteria. Finally, it is suggested that fairer and more valid decisions might be made if administrators participate in activities that help make them more aware of and increase the complexity of their own criteria (such as the use of Brown's form PROM).

N1  - Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Education in Journalism (61st, Seattle, Washington, August 13-16, 1978); Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document
N2  - Two exercises that can be used with journalism students to help them clarify and think through the editorial process are the repertory grid and the coorientation model. A technique developed in England by the followers of psychologist George Kelly, the repertory grid asks students to rank ten or twelve authors on criteria such as social acceptability, professional effectiveness, and liberalism-conservatism. The student then decides which authors are closest and which are farthest from his or her "ideal self" and "actual self." The follow-up discussion clarifies the issues involved in defining oneself (or a more detailed analysis is achieved through the use of a computer). The second exercise, the coorientation model, requires students to rank or rate story titles or leads according to interest or probable readership for themselves and for a clearly defined audience. These ratings are then compared with hypothetical play in editing a publication or with actual survey results of audience ratings. Effective use of these two techniques involves consistent discussion and evaluation on the individual level, along with statistical analyses. (Author/MAI)

T1  - Assessing Attitudes to Reading.
A1  - Ewing, J M
Y1  - 1977//
Y2  - 1977-10//
N2  - Many measurement techniques have been developed to assess elements related to attitudes toward reading, which encompass an individual's views, feelings, values, and beliefs. Instruments developed by British teachers include Likert-type scales, a repertory grid technique, and an approach assessing reactions to screened photographs of different reading situations. Attitude assessment techniques may be divided into the following categories: interviews, which are practicable only for small sample work; Likert-type and Thurstone-type scales comprising a series of statements about reading with which pupils are required to indicate degree of agreement or disagreement; sentence completion and open-ended questioning related to attitudes toward reading; semantic differential scales, which require pupils to rate aspects of reading on each of several different scales; repertory grids, on which pupils react to statements about reading experiences; and self-reports, for which students answer a series of questions about reading situations. A model has been developed to allow for a comparison of the attitudes of individuals and groups. (The paper provides suggestions for constructing and scoring attitude measurement scales.) (GW)

Y2  - 1977-10//
N1  - Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Reading Association of Ireland (2nd, Dublin, Ireland, October 6-8, 1977) ; Not available in hard copy because of print quality
N2  - Historically less emphasis has been put on the importance of attitude factors than on the skills of reading. When defining attitudes as a person's views, interests, expectations, and so on, attitude toward reading is a combination of all components that contribute to a person's underlying disposition to reading including expectations, interest, appeal of material, and personal satisfaction. One way to group these components is to consider the characteristics of the reader (internal) and the characteristics of the situation (external). If both components can be independently positive or negative then it would be possible to consider the effects of internal or external factors on the reader's skills. Four techniques are available for measuring attitudes: attitude scales, self-reports and interviews, the semantic differential, and the repertory grid. The planning of a reading curriculum can be aided by the use of attitude analysis to learn what should be emphasized in a particular group or among readers generally. This might be especially important if it can be shown, for instance, that readers who have negative attitudes toward internal components and positive attitudes toward external components are poorer readers than those with opposite attitude scores.

N2  - This paper illustrates how the Kelly repertory grid and the Thomas focusing technique can be used to help teachers and learners become aware of learners' purposes for reading, and how these purposes can be used in a program for improving competencies in reading for learning. The grid elicitation and focusing techniques are briefly described. Four focused grids elicted from students in the college of education are used to show how differently the same universe of discourse (purposes for reading) can be interpreted. A consensus grid illustrates how nine students differentiated between those purposes related to educational activities, pleasure, and real learning. These grids were used as a starting point for learning conversations, in which students reviewed and changed their repertoire of purposes. Improvement in reading skills resulting from the learning conversations is reviewed, as well as results from a follow-up consensus grid. (Author/AA)

N2  - The repertory grid technique was used to explore psychopaths' interpersonal and personal construct systems. Subjects were asked to construe as individuals, and subjects were asked how they thought people in general construed the situations. Psychopaths showed a significant degree of general misperception about people in general. (Author)
