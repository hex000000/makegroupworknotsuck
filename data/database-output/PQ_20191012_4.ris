T1  - Classification of human resources based on measurement of tacit knowledge
AN  - 1354991674
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate employees of an organization in order to evaluate and classify them based on their tacit knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, staff's tacit knowledge is measured at the individual level, in automotive sector. Design/methodology/approach - Repertory grid technique has been used as a mechanism to aid the elicitation and evaluation of individuals' personal constructs. Then, Pathfinder analysis was carried out to examine the individual's knowledge structure. The similarities between knowledge structure of expert and novice was measured by the set-theoretic index C, in order to classify staff and ultimately, for analysis of each group, Idiogrid software was used. Findings - Based on closeness index, all employees were classified into four categories. Respondent's perceptions were evaluated by comparing the mental model graphs of the individuals in different categories with experts' graphs. Ultimately, the best or the most effective HR practices were determined for managing knowledge workers. Research limitations/implications - This study may help HRM department to differentiate between low and high-performing employees for determining the most effective HR practices to manage staff. Furthermore, it has significant implications in team building and designing a knowledge map within organizations. Originality/value - This paper reveals effective linkages between human resource management and knowledge management.

AB  - Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Erasmus University, "In this study, it was explored a refined one-to-one interview technique, check-all-that-apply (CATA) linked with a repertory grid method (RGM) (CATA/RGM) designed to measure consumer-relevant Kansei - psychological feelings and impressions for products - as applied to 12 commercial bottled tea products. For statistical analyses, 2 multivariate statistical methods for Kansei profiling were compared: CATA/RGM based-structured free choice profiling (FCP) and cued elicitation. Results showed that the CATA/RGM efficiently differentiated between products, and the product differentiation obtained from the 2 Kansei profiling techniques corresponded."

T1  - Identifying attributes required by Foundation Year 1 doctors in multidisciplinary teams: a tool for performance evaluation
AN  - 1778810452
AB  - Background

              
Effective working in multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) is promoted as essential in ensuring good healthcare outcomes, suggesting that an understanding exists of the relationship between outcomes and the attributes needed by individuals to function effectively in the MDT. While the characteristics of effective teamwork have been described, the attributes needed by individual MDT members have not been investigated. To address this, the study focuses on newly qualified Foundation Year 1 (FY1) doctors, creating and testing a tool to evaluate their performance in the MDT.

              
Methods

              
Repertory grid technique was used to elicit attributes needed by FY1 doctors to function effectively in the MDT. Study participants (all experienced MDT members) used these to evaluate MDT working by FY1 doctor colleagues. Data on 57 FY1 doctors were collected from 95 MDT members working in five hospitals. Participants also ranked the attributes in terms of importance for effective team functioning and rated an 'Ideal' FY1 doctor.

              
Results

              
The repertory grid permitted differentiation between groups of FY1 doctors' MDT performance. FY1 doctors who undertook interprofessional training were rated no differently than UK-trained graduates without such training. UK-trained graduates were rated significantly higher on all attributes than non-UK-trained graduates. Overall, FY1 doctors were rated lower than the 'Ideal'. Factor analysis and rankings suggested tensions between clinical attributes needed for good team functioning and more 'social' attributes.

              
Conclusions

              
This study demonstrates the potential of repertory grid methodology in eliciting attributes that are important for effective teamworking, and using these to evaluate MDT working by FY1 doctors.

T1  - Scale Development For Breakfast Cereals Using The Kelly Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 1418712667
AB  - Consumer research is a key component of retail strategy and a major facilitator in the formation of a competitive advantage (Devlin, Birtwistle & Macedo, 2003). A sophisticated research approach that contributes a meaningful understanding of the dynamics of consumer's perceptual orientations is of particular value to retailers (Mitchell, 2001). Gaining knowledge of the attributes consumers value and use to discriminate between products and why those attributes are important can generate a sustainable competitive advantage for retailers (Mitchell & Harris, 2005). Consumer perceptions of product attributes are crucial factors in the choice of food products. A focus on the subjective entities of a product as perceived by consumers is a major determining factor in the success of many product marketing strategies (Kupiec & Revell, 2001). One method that has been utilized to identify product attributes is the Kelly repertory grid method (Kelly, 1955). This method has also been used in previous studies for the recognition of food product attributes (Thomson & McEwan, 1988). The repertory grid technique (RGT) has been adopted in consumer research for examining consumers' perceptions of products and services (Marsden & Littler, 2000). The following research project intends to help retailers understand grocery shoppers' perceptions of breakfast cereals. The objective of the research is two-fold. First, to determine which attributes consumers perceive differences between breakfast cereals. Second, to generate a survey to measure the underlying constructs comprising breakfast cereals using the Kelly Repertory Grid Technique.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using the repertory grid technique to surface strategic planning assumptions
AN  - 1317441368
AB  - Purpose - In his article titled, "The theory of the business," Peter Drucker suggests that organizations need to frequently challenge the assumptions underlying their theory of the business (TOB) in order to assure that it remains viable. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to introduce the repertory grid technique (RGT) and illustrate how it can be used as a strategic planning tool to surface the assumptions underlying an organization's TOB. Design/methodology/approach - The RGT's merits as a planning tool are demonstrated through a case study involving the president of a Pittsburgh-based financial services organization. Specifically, this case study describes how the RGT and the organization's competitors were used to surface the assumptions underlying the organization's TOB. Findings - The paper describes how the assumptions surfaced from this case study can be used to challenge the organization's TOB. Furthermore, guidance is offered as to how the RGT can be integrated into an organization's strategic planning process and a list of resources that one can refer to for further information concerning the RGT is provided. Originality/value - While the RGT has been used by scholars as a research tool and various authors have suggested that it can be used to address various organizational challenges (e.g., implementing a new system), no one to date has demonstrated its value as a strategic planning tool. Consequently, the paper is a valuable resource for practitioners, as well as academics and consultants who provide strategic planning services to organizations.

T1  - Exploring beliefs about heart failure treatment in adherent and nonadherent patients: use of the repertory grid technique
AN  - 2222825208
AB  - Purpose: Beliefs about medicines impact on adherence, but eliciting core beliefs about medicines in individual patients is difficult. One method that has the potential to elicit individual core beliefs is the "repertory grid technique." This study utilized the repertory grid technique to elicit individuals' beliefs about their heart failure treatment and to investigate whether generated constructs were different between adherent and nonadherent patients.
Methods: Ninety-two patients with heart failure were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that applied the repertory grid technique. Patients were asked to compare and contrast their medicines and self-care activities for their heart failure. This lead to the generation of individual constructs (perceptions towards medicines), and from these, beliefs were elicited about their heart failure treatment, resulting in the generation of a repertory grid. Adherence was measured using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS). Patients with a MARS score ≥ 23 were categorized as "adherent" and those with a score ≤ 22 as "nonadherent." The generated grids were analyzed descriptively and constructs from all grids themed and the frequency of these constructs compared between adherent and nonadherent patients.
Results: Individual grids provided insight into the different beliefs that patients held about their heart failure treatment. The themed constructs "related to water," "affect the heart," "related to weight," and "benefit to the heart" occurred more frequently in adherent patients compared with nonadherent patients.
Conclusion: The repertory grid technique elicited beliefs of individual participants about the treatment of their heart failure. Constructs from self-reported adherent patients were more likely to reflect that their medicines and self-care activities were related to water and weight, and affect and benefit to the heart. Providing clinicians with better insight into individuals' beliefs about their treatment may facilitate the development of tailored interventions to improve adherence.

T1  - How Useful Are the Strategic Tools We Teach in Business Schools?
AN  - 1931823821
AB  - Strategic tools are indispensible for business and competitive analysis. Yet we know very little about managers' internal logic as they put these tools into practical use. We situate our study in a business school context using action learning prior to the manifestation of practice to complement our understanding of practice. Using Personal Construct Theory and Repertory Grids, our mid-range theorizing showed that, contrary to current thinking about strategic tools, managers think in dualities (often paradoxically) and have a preference for multiple-tools-in-use, tools that provide different perspectives, peripheral vision, connected thinking, simultaneously help differentiate and integrate complex issues, and guide the thinking process. These findings are important for designing better tools and the nurturing of critical managerial competencies needed for a complicated world. Our study's focus also has wider implications for scholars as we see our own material evaluated by those who will put these lessons into practice.

T1  - Categorizing stakeholders' practices with repertory grids for sustainable development
AN  - 1424323032
AB  - In this paper, the authors put forward a method for categorizing stakeholder diversity as a means to facilitate managers' discussions of sustainability issues. Their general contribution is to conduct a stakeholder analysis based on the stakeholders' practices instead of their power and interests, the latter being a more usual focus. Their mapping method consists in codifying stakeholders' practices within an inductive procedure that is deeply rooted in what they currently do rather than literature-driven categories. More specifically, they adapt the well-known repertory-grid technique to represent practices on qualitative scales. Using several working groups dealing with rural sustainability issues, this method has proved effective in collectively building repertories of practices and stakeholder categories. They show that the method is helpful to participants in that it extends their representations of stakeholders and helps them to reframe sustainability. While contributing to practice-based studies, this paper also contributes methodologically to empirical studies on collective problem structuring concerning sustainability issues.

T1  - The Semantics of Power Among People With Eating Disorders
AN  - 1151997498
AB  - The study aimed to empirically test the hypothesis, developed within the systemic-constructionist theory of family semantic polarities, that the semantics of power are particularly meaningful for people with eating disorders. The repertory grid technique was used to elicit constructs from 30 young patients (10 anorexic, 10 bulimic, and 10 obese) and from a matched control group; the two sets of constructs were compared in terms of their semantic content. Overall the results confirmed the hypothesis, although further investigation into the semantic peculiarities of individual eating disorders is required. Methodological limitations and possible clinical applications are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Personal Construct Approach to Understanding Stress in Mothers of Children Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders
AN  - 1151997112
AB  - This study explored the contribution of personal construct psychology (PCP) and the repertory grid technique to understanding stress when raising a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Associations between child level of functional impairment, parenting stress, psychological distress, and maternal construing were examined in mothers of 25 children diagnosed with ASD. Results suggest that a personal construct perspective may help delineate factors involved in parent adjustment to ASD. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Thinking About Challenging Behavior: A Repertory Grid Study of Inpatient Staff Beliefs
AN  - 1288355823; 23256689
AB  - Studies examining staffattitudes toward people with intellectual disability have traditionally used pre-determined categories and models or been open to researcher bias. The use of methods derived from personal construct psychology permits an objective investigation of staffviews and attitudes without such limitations. Fourteen stafffrom an inpatient intellectual disability service were interviewed about their perceptions of clients with challenging behavior primarily using the repertory grid technique as developed from personal construct theory. Staffwas found to construe their clients and their behaviors in a heterogeneous manner that was not readily reducible to a group average, and they did not make or use attributions about them in a consistent manner. Future research should incorporate work culture and the staff-client relationship. The results have implications for clinical decision making, team working, and clinical supervision.

T1  - The practical utility of using repertory grids with sexual offenders maintaining their innocence: a case study
AN  - 1154461157
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper is to highlight the practical utility of using repertory grids with sexual offenders in denial and to demonstrate through a case study how they can be used to bolster both initial assessment and psychological formulation. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a single case study design and applies a repertory grid methodology, which is underpinned by personal construct psychology, to make sense of the case study. The analysis predominately focuses on the structure of the repertory grid. Findings - The case study appeared to elicit factors that were of clinical utility and which could be used as tentative hypotheses for problem formulation and also seemed to point to an adequate starting point for intervention. Research limitations/implications - The use of the case study makes generalisation difficult and future research may benefit from more large-scale research. Practical implications - Rather than subscribing to fatalist notions of deniers as untreatable, the paper argues that constructive work can be done with this population and that repertory grids can be one way to initially facilitate this process. Originality/value - Currently "total deniers" are excluded from treatment and are seen as untreatable. It is argued here that this need not be the case and it is demonstrated how repertory grids can inform initial formulation with such offenders. Repertory grids have not been used with deniers before and this is an original feature of this research.

T1  - A Study on the Landscape Images of Hokkaido Constructed through Tourist Gazes
AN  - 1504526607
AB  - Landscape is one of the most important resources for tourism in Hokkaido. However, it is not yet clear what kinds of symbols constructing landscape representation are connected with the social construction of Hokkaido. In this study, the combination of a landscape image sketch and a questionnaire of repertory grid method revealed the social construction of Hokkaido through tourist gazes connected with landscape imagery of Hokkaido. The survey among Hokkaido residents, Japanese visitors and Taiwanese visitors was conducted in New Chitose Airport in summer and winter seasons. As a result, the landscape images of rural landscapes were appeared representing 'vast nature' common in the Hokkaido residents and Japanese visitors. It implies that the social construction of Hokkaido is affected by tourist gazes through mass media and further penetrates into the residents' local identity. On the other hand, Taiwanese visitors tended to represent impressive scenes and what they experienced through their sightseeing in Hokkaido. Hokkaido tourisms need to connect the social construction with cultural landscapes including production process and seasonal changes for regional development.

AB  - This article presents a repertory grid study of young people who had experienced civil war in Sierra Leone, some as child soldiers and others as noncombatants. Unexpected findings included that the former combatants viewed themselves more favorably than did noncombatants. The findings are discussed in terms of individual and social construing processes, drawing on narratives and interview and focus group responses obtained from the participants in the larger investigation of which this study was part. Particular consideration is given to the role of forgiveness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Personal Construct System of a Runaway Adolescent: An Illustrative Case Study
AN  - 1151997503
AB  - Personal constructs of an 18-year-old adolescent were explored by the use of a repertory grid focusing on the domains of family, self, and world. Results indicated that the runaway adolescent construed his family in a negative and rejecting way, whereas important people outside the family were perceived in a more accepting and friendly manner. It was also found that although the young man construed himself in a positive manner, at the same time he perceived himself as aloof and distant from both family and nonfamily members. The findings indicate that a young adolescent's decision to run away from home and jump into the world of the unknown is the consequence of certain push factors in the home environment and pull factors in the external world. Results of the grid are discussed in light of key elements in construct space. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Governance of open content creation: A conceptualization and analysis of control and guiding mechanisms in the open content domain
AN  - 1052938012
AB  - The open content creation process has proven itself to be a powerful and influential way of developing text-based content, as demonstrated by the success of Wikipedia and related sites. Distributed individuals independently edit, revise, or refine content, thereby creating knowledge artifacts of considerable breadth and quality. Our study explores the mechanisms that control and guide the content creation process and develops an understanding of open content governance. The repertory grid method is employed to systematically capture the experiences of individuals involved in the open content creation process and to determine the relative importance of the diverse control and guiding mechanisms. Our findings illustrate the important control and guiding mechanisms and highlight the multifaceted nature of open content governance. A range of governance mechanisms is discussed with regard to the varied levels of formality, the different loci of authority, and the diverse interaction environments involved. Limitations and opportunities for future research are provided. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Critical Review of Some Qualitative Research Methods Used to Explore Rater Cognition
AN  - 1042597748
AB  - Internationally, many assessment systems rely predominantly on human raters to score examinations. Arguably, this facilitates the assessment of multiple sophisticated educational constructs, strengthening assessment validity. It can introduce subjectivity into the scoring process, however, engendering threats to accuracy. The present objectives are to examine some key qualitative data collection methods used internationally to research this potential trade-off, and to consider some theoretical contexts within which the methods are usable. Self-report methods such as Kelly's Repertory Grid, think aloud, stimulated recall, and the NASA task load index have yielded important insights into the competencies needed for scoring expertise, as well as the sequences of mental activity that scoring typically involves. Examples of new data and of recent studies are used to illustrate these methods' strengths and weaknesses. This investigation has significance for assessment designers, developers and administrators. It may inform decisions on the methods' applicability in American and other rater cognition research contexts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Rigor in qualitative supply chain management research: Lessons from applying repertory grid technique
AN  - 1129462110
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to share the authors' experiences of using the repertory grid technique in two supply chain management studies. The paper aims to demonstrate how the two studies provided insights into how qualitative techniques such as the repertory grid can be made more rigorous than in the past, and how results can be generated that are inaccessible using quantitative methods. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents two studies undertaken using the repertory grid technique to illustrate its application in supply chain management research. Findings - The paper presents insights into supply chain research that otherwise would not have emerged using traditional methods. Both studies derive a comprehensive list of empirical categories of constructs, many of which have not been identified in the extant literature. Moreover, the technique demonstrates that frequently-mentioned constructs are not necessarily the most important. Research limitations/implications - The paper demonstrates how quantitative calculations can strengthen qualitative research. Importantly, from the authors' experience of using the technique the paper details how to focus on demonstrating validity, reliability, and theoretical saturation. Originality/value - It is the authors' contention that the addition of the repertory grid technique to the toolset of methods used by logistics and supply chain management researchers can only enhance insights and the building of robust theories. Qualitative studies that adopt the technique cannot only provide rich insights, but also counter the common criticism aimed at qualitative research - that of failing to provide clear and transparent accounts of the analysis process and how findings are generated from the data set.

T1  - Clinical Pharmacy; New Clinical Pharmacy Study Findings Have Been Published by Investigators at Gold Coast Hospital
AN  - 1035654438
AB  - Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Gold Coast Hospital, "Patients were divided into those categorised as adherent (MARS score a parts per thousand yen 23) and those categorised as non-adherent (MARS score < 23). Necessity beliefs scores from BMQ and the frequency of statements generated from the repertory grid portion of the questionnaire were compared between these two groups. Forty-three patients were interviewed with a mean age (+/- SD) of 64 (+/- 17) years and thirty-six (83.7 %) were male. Thirty-seven (86.0 %) patients were categorised as adherent; the remaining six (14.0 %) as non-adherent. The 43 patients generated a total of 262 statements about their medicines. The three most common themes identified were Related to fluid (36.6 %), Helps the heart (31.7 %) and Related to weight (13.7 %). There was a significantly higher median necessity score in the adherent group compared to the non adherent group (22.0 vs. 19.5, p = 0.0272).

T1  - Comparación de efectividad de las técnicas de educción de requisitos software: visión novel y experta/Comparison on effectiveness of the software requirements elicitation techniques: novice and expert vision
AN  - 1321927293
AB  - Requirements engineering can use a lot of techniques to gather the users' needs. However, currently there are few practical guidelines and criteria for selecting techniques in a software development project. This paper tries to know the vision that novice requirements engineers have about the effectiveness of requirements elicitation techniques and compare it with the requirements experts' vision. To carry out the comparison, repertory grid technique was used. This technique allows knowing indirectly the subject's opinion on the techniques. The results show a substantial difference between both visions with regard to the techniques and elicitation context. This implies that a more extensive training, and primarily practice, is necessary in order for novice engineers to recognize differences in techniques effectiveness and decide with greater certainty about the most appropriate techniques to use in requirements elicitation sessions.

T1  - Perceptions of Industrial Design: The "Means" and the "Ends"
AN  - 1032776352
AB  - It is widely accepted that industrial design can play an important role in the development of innovative products, but integrating design-thinking into new product development (NPD) is a challenge. This is because industrial designers have very different perspectives and goals than the other members of the NPD team, and this can lead to tensions. It has been postulated that the communications between NPD managers and industrial designers are made more difficult because each group uses very different language. This research made the first empirical investigation of the language used by designers and managers in describing "good" and "poor" industrial design. In-depth interviews were conducted with a sample of 19 managers and industrial designers at five leading companies. Multiple sources of data were utilized, including the repertory grid technique to elicit the key attributes of design, from the perspective of managers and designers.

T1  - CONTRIBUTIONS OF REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF EATING DISORDERS / APORTACIONES DE LA TÉCNICA DE REJILLA EN LA COMPRENSIÓN DE LOS TRASTORNOS ALIMENTARIOS
AN  - 2231322363
AB  - This research aimed to identify structural aspects and content of the construct system of daughters diagnosed with eating disorders and their mothers. In this descriptive study, the Repertory Grid Technique and a focused interview was undertaken. Participants were 14 young women, 18 to 29 years, and their respective mothers. The results revealed that 70% of daughters and all mothers have cognitive rigidity. Regarding the constructs of self, the contents are mainly grouped in emotional aspects for daughters and in personal aspects for mothers. The contents of the differing constructs of daughters and mothers are grouped into emotional aspects. The most frequent implicative dilemmas refer to the search for autonomy / self-affirmation which involves abandonment of others.
El objetivo de investigación fue identificar características estructurales y de contenido del sistema de constructos de hijas diagnosticadas con trastornos de conducta alimentaria y de sus madres. En este estudio descriptivo, se aplicó a 14 hijas, de 18 a 29 años, y madres, técnica de rejilla interpersonal y entrevista focalizada. En los resultados destaca que el 70% de hijas y la totalidad de madres presentan rigidez cognitiva. En el contenido de los constructos de autodefinición de las hijas destacan aspectos emocionales y en las madres, aspectos personales. Los contenidos de los constructos discrepantes de ambas, se agrupan en aspectos emocionales. En los dilemas implicativos se presenta con mayor frecuencia la búsqueda de autonomía/autoafimación que implica abandono de los demás.

T1  - Exploring the beliefs of heart failure patients towards their heart failure medicines and self care activities
AN  - 1026726571; 22717778
AB  - Aim To identify Heart Failure patients' beliefs towards their medications and how these beliefs relate to adherence. Method Patients attending a multi-disciplinary, community based heart failure clinic on the Gold Coast, Australia were interviewed using a questionnaire composed of fours parts: repertory grid technique; Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ); Medicines Adherence Reporting Scale (MARS); demographic details. Patients were divided into those categorised as adherent (MARS score ≥ 23) and those categorised as non-adherent (MARS score < 23). Necessity beliefs scores from BMQ and the frequency of statements generated from the repertory grid portion of the questionnaire were compared between these two groups. Results Forty-three patients were interviewed with a mean age (±SD) of 64 (±17) years and thirty-six (83.7 %) were male. Thirty-seven (86.0 %) patients were categorised as adherent; the remaining six (14.0 %) as non-adherent. The 43 patients generated a total of 262 statements about their medicines. The three most common themes identified were Related to fluid (36.6 %), Helps the heart (31.7 %) and Related to weight (13.7 %). There was a significantly higher median necessity score in the adherent group compared to the non adherent group (22.0 vs. 19.5, p = 0.0272). Patients with a strong necessity score also had significantly higher self reported adherence compared to patients with a strong concerns score (21.5 vs. 18.0, p = 0.006). Conclusion This study suggests that patients with heart failure possessing a strong belief in the necessity of their treatment regimen are more likely to demonstrate better adherence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A review of the uses of the Kelly's Repertory Grid method in educational assessment and comparability research studies
AN  - 1022704305
AB  - Comparability between different educational qualifications is an important issue within policy discourse in the UK. In this context, the comparability of qualification demands has been explored through the use of expert human judgement. The involvement of human judgement in estimating assessment demands has consequences for methodology. This review considered the ways that the Kelly's Repertory Grid (KRG) technique has been used to compare assessment demands over recent years. The review involved the identification and analysis of research documents as well as consideration of the original theory on which the KRG method was founded. This article describes how the technique has been adapted as it has shifted from its original psychotherapeutic context to be used in educational assessment and comparability studies. The review also explored possible disadvantages that stem from these adaptations, leading to recommendations to ensure the validity of findings when using the technique in educational assessment studies.

T1  - Using repertory grids to explore musical skills and attitudes in a mature-age adult at the early stages of learning for self-fulfilment: A case study of James
AN  - 1020122510
AB  - Repertory grids were used as a research tool to explore 73-year-old James' musical development over two years. Choosing two music learning cultures for his instrumental learning, James learned the piano in a college workshop and the Appalachian dulcimer in his local folk group. There were clear changes in his musical skills and attitudes, particularly in relation to performing and practising, and an increase in his musical maturity as he transformed himself from a music listener into a musical performer, reconstructing himself as an amateur musician. The empowerment gained from his reconstruction was a critical factor in James' self-fulfilment as a mature-age adult. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mental Health; Research from Royal Manchester Children's Hospital Provide New Insights into Mental Health
AN  - 1017815186
AB  - Our news editors obtained a quote from the research by the authors from Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, "Ten psychiatric nursing staff working in a specialist mother and baby unit in the North of England were interviewed about their views of various types of client by using the repertory grid technique. A total of 86 constructs that clustered under 21 headings were elicited. All staff made critical judgements about some clients. Staff often described the context in which these perceptions were reached such as the behaviour of clients and the quality of the nurse-client relationship. Clients with a personality disorder and those who were thought to be 'bad' mothers were construed as being furthest from the self and more negatively than clients with depression or psychosis. Further training is indicated for staff working with mothers displaying challenging interactional styles; however, training packages must consider the individuality of perception and experience present within staff groups.

T1  - The effective analyst: a study of what makes an effective crime and intelligence analyst
AN  - 1017837831
AB  - The current study aimed to identify the skills and abilities required by an analyst to be recognised as effective. Thirty subject matter experts (SMEs) were engaged using the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) to explore the specific skills and abilities of crime and intelligence analysts that result in them being deemed effective. Semi-structured interviews and the Critical Incident Technique (CIT) were conducted to strengthen these findings. Three clusters of variables were identified that indicate an effective analyst; they would have skills and abilities that could contribute to the development and dissemination of an analytical product, they would have an attitude that included being productive, seeking out work, having a high-level commitment and pride and having a 'can do' attitude. Some physical and personal attributes, like gender and age, were included that characterise effectiveness. The findings are discussed in relation to earlier descriptions of the skills needed to be an analyst. The findings illustrate a change from the analyst being seen as a technical specialist to a growing understanding of the analyst as part of a support structure for decision-makers. Implications of the findings for recruitment, training and development are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Aesthetic Learning About, In, With and Through the Arts: A Curriculum Study
AN  - 1016584094
AB  - Aesthetic learning is a major issue in arts education. The 'method of art' is often expected to facilitate in-depth learning not only in the arts but across the curriculum. This article defines aesthetic learning in terms of a conceptual framework based on two dimensions, one representing the goal and the other the means of aesthetic learning. The goal is described as convergent or divergent. Convergent learning is goal-directed, focused and rational, while divergent learning is explorative, open-ended and intuitive. The means are described as medium-specific or medium-neutral. Medium-specific learning emphasises the forms of representation, for example words, pictures, algebra, dance. Medium-neutral learning emphasises instrumental aspects of learning, such as academic achievement or personal development. Combining these dimensions two-by-two, the author arrives at a suggested definition of what is meant by learning about, learning in, learning with and learning through the arts. The rest of the article investigates the potential utility of this framework in various contexts and for different purposes. First, the author presents two temporary 'Culture-in-School' projects. Secondly, the framework is used to study aesthetic learning processes in sloyd (art & craft), based on student teachers' portfolios in metalwork. Thirdly, the four modes of learning are compared to equivalent modes of teaching: the instructor, the facilitator, the advisor and the educator. Fourthly, there is a discussion on the role of aesthetics in a 'balanced' curriculum. Finally, there is an argument on the need for a variety of assessment tools based on the four modes of learning and teaching, such as copying, portfolios, projects and the repertory grid technique.

T1  - Cultural differences and students' spontaneous models of the water cycle: a case study of Jewish and Bedouin children in Israel
AN  - 1010969649
AB  - The present research aims at pinpointing differences in spontaneous and non-spontaneous mental models of water cycle conceptions of two 4th grade student groups: the Jewish residents of a small provincial town and a group of students from an indigenous Bedouin community. Students' conceptions were elicited using the Repertory Grid technique as well by being asked to draw "what happens to water in nature?" In later interviews, in addition to answering specially designed open-ended interview questions, the students were also requested to elaborate on their drawings and responses to the Repertory Grid technique. The Bedouin students were found to have richer mental models of water cycle phenomena; their models included more components of the water cycle and were more authentic and connected to other natural phenomena. On the other hand, Bedouin students also employed theological explanations to make sense of water cycle phenomena. These findings, as well as methodological issues relating to spontaneous and non-spontaneous models elicitation are discussed and implications for instruction are offered.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Factors influencing societal response of nanotechnology: an expert stakeholder analysis
AN  - 1285634497
AB  - Nanotechnology can be described as an emerging technology and, as has been the case with other emerging technologies such as genetic modification, different socio-psychological factors will potentially influence societal responses to its development and application. These factors will play an important role in how nanotechnology is developed and commercialised. This article aims to identify expert opinion on factors influencing societal response to applications of nanotechnology. Structured interviews with experts on nanotechnology from North West Europe were conducted using repertory grid methodology in conjunction with generalized Procrustes analysis to examine the psychological constructs underlying societal uptake of 15 key applications of nanotechnology drawn from different areas (e.g. medicine, agriculture and environment, chemical, food, military, sports, and cosmetics). Based on expert judgement, the main factors influencing societal response to different applications of nanotechnology will be the extent to which applications are perceived to be beneficial, useful, and necessary, and how 'real' and physically close to the end-user these applications are perceived to be by the public.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using the Repertory Grid Technique to Examine Nursing Staff's Construal of Mothers with Mental Health Problems
AN  - 1013443139
AB  - This study explored the attitudes of psychiatric nursing staff towards mothers with mental health difficulties. Working with mothers experiencing mental health problems can evoke negative reactions in staff that activate value-laden beliefs regarding the capacity of these women to care for their infants, which could diminish the provision of optimal care and treatment for patients. Ten psychiatric nursing staff working in a specialist mother and baby unit in the North of England were interviewed about their views of various types of client by using the repertory grid technique. A total of 86 constructs that clustered under 21 headings were elicited. All staff made critical judgements about some clients. Staff often described the context in which these perceptions were reached such as the behaviour of clients and the quality of the nurse-client relationship. Clients with a personality disorder and those who were thought to be 'bad' mothers were construed as being furthest from the self and more negatively than clients with depression or psychosis. Further training is indicated for staff working with mothers displaying challenging interactional styles; however, training packages must consider the individuality of perception and experience present within staff groups.

T1  - Changes in the Construct Systems of First-Year University Students: Impact on Psychological Symptoms and Problem-Solving Skills
AN  - 1030253758
AB  - This article studies the levels of psychological symptoms, problem-solving skills and self-construction in 28 freshmen, as assessed at the beginning and end of their first year at university. The repertory grid technique was used to assess self-ideal discrepancy, cognitive differentiation, and existence of implicative dilemmas. Results showed an improvement in psychological symptoms and self-ideal discrepancy, an increase in differentiation, but no significant differences in problem-solving skills. One or more implicative dilemmas were found in over half of the sample at the initial assessment and only in one-third at the final one, although this difference was not significant. Psychological symptoms at the end of the first year were predicted only by the initial reported symptoms. However, problem-solving skills at the end were predicted by a model including both initial skills and implicative dilemmas at the beginning of the year. Some implications for the adaptation of students during the first year at university are discussed.

T1  - Bibliometric Review of the Repertory Grid Technique: 1998-2007
AN  - 1030252147
AB  - This bibliometric review covers the scientific production with or about the repertory grid technique (RGT; Kelly, 1955/1991) between 1998 and 2007. An analysis of previous reviews suggests the need for a more careful and broad process of bibliographic research. With this aim, 24 bibliographic sources were used to cover a wide range of specialties. We began by drawing up an explicit protocol in which the research terms were detailed. Then we consulted the bibliographic sources, taking into account a specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result of this process, 973 references were obtained: 468 journal papers, 335 book chapters, 108 doctoral theses, and 62 books. The review also evaluates the types of documents found, the evolution of the number of works published, the repertory grid's fields of application, and the degree of openness to other disciplines. The most relevant authors, their affiliations, countries, and the publication language are also revealed in this article, as well as the major journals contributing to dissemination of the work done with this technique.

T1  - Understanding communities' views of nature in rural industry renewal: the transition from forestry to nature-based tourism in Eden, Australia
AN  - 925764542
AB  - This scoping paper examines the complex issue of assessing and understanding community views about the restructuring towards nature-based rural tourism of traditional agriculture and forestry rural economies and their activities that had hitherto shaped local identities. It shows how individual resident perceptions can be included within social impact assessment through the use of psychological methods and discusses the relative merits of using personal construct theory -based repertory grids. Ten repertory grid interviews were completed in Eden, New South Wales, Australia. The findings present both the resulting repertory grids and a more detailed discussion of the interpretation of the grids through two narratives that focus on residents considering what, in their opinion, constitutes a sustainable utilisation of local forest land. The discussion examines how the results of this type of analysis can be used to understand individual residents' decisions to support or reject nature-based tourism proposals in favour of traditional extractive forest-industry sectors. It shows how this assessment system could aid planners in reconciling stakeholder conflict over the ideal usage of public forest land by offering a structured means of giving heterogeneous rural communities a formal voice in tourism-planning processes.

AN  - 915434863
AB  - To discover personal meanings and patterns of everyday food choices across different situations we used a qualitative approach in the form of repertory grid interviews. An analysis of the personal constructs elicited from a representative sample of 100 Swiss consumers revealed elaborated value systems. The food-related values can be summarised as: authenticity/naturalness, conviviality, health, quality/indulgence, convenience, and price. The salience of these values and their negatively evaluated counterparts differed for various social eating situations and product categories. Consumers' personal values also differed significantly from their perception of current trends in eating culture.

AB  - The present study uses personal construct theory and the repertory grid technique to examine staff views of individual clients with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, in particular those clients who purge and restrict. Fourteen members of nursing staff, both qualified and non-qualified, participated in the research. The results suggest that the 14 members of staff interviewed did construe clients who purge and clients who restrict in markedly different ways. The theoretical implications of this finding are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluation of a Positive Youth Development Program Based on the Repertory Grid Test
AN  - 2036415416
AB  - The repertory grid test, based on personal construct psychology, was used to evaluate the effectiveness of Project P.A.T.H.S. (Positive Adolescent Training through Holistic Social Programmes) in Hong Kong. One hundred and four program participants (																					n								=								104																		) were randomly invited to complete a repertory grid based on personal construct theory in order to provide both quantitative and qualitative data for measuring self-identity changes after joining the program. Findings generally showed that the participants perceived that they understood themselves better and had stronger resilience after joining the program. Participants also saw themselves as closer to their ideal selves and other positive role figures (but farther away from a loser) after joining the program. This study provides additional support for the effectiveness of the Tier 1 Program of Project P.A.T.H.S. in the Chinese context. This study also shows that the repertory grid test is a useful evaluation method to measure self-identity changes in participants in positive youth development programs.

T1  - Personal Construction of Cough Medicine among Young Substance Abusers in Hong Kong
AN  - 2036320660
AB  - Although cough medicine abuse is a growing problem in many places, there is no study examining the views of young substance abusers toward cough medicine. The objective of this study was to examine personal constructions of cough medicine abusers via the repertory grid tests (																					N								=								11																		). Several observations are highlighted from the study. First, personal constructions of cough medicine were mixed, including the benefits and harmful effects of its abuse. Second, although the informants perceived cough medicine to be addictive and harmful, they perceived cough medicine to be less addictive and less harmful than did heroin. Third, while the informants construed cough medicine to be similar to ketamine and marijuana, they also perceived cough medicine to possess some characteristics of heroin. Fourth, relative to the construed similarity between heroin and the gateway drugs (cigarette, beer, and liquor), the informants construed cough medicine to be more similar to the gateway drugs. Finally, a higher level of perceived dissimilarity between cough medicine and gateway drugs was related to a higher level of perceived harm of cough medicine abuse.

T1  - Analyzing Students' Technology Use Motivations: An Interpretive Structural Modeling Approach
AN  - 1459460717
AB  - Despite being more meaningful and accurate to consider student technology use motivations as a set of interactive needs and expectations, the possible underlying hierarchical relationships among motivations receive little attention. Drawn from Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach and from Means-End Chain (MEC) theory, this study investigates how student technology use motivations can be represented as a set of interrelated and hierarchically organized elements. A set of relevant data concerning students' technology use motivations was collected by the Repertory Grid Interview Technique (RGT) and analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. Eleven identified student technology use motivations were structured by adopting interpretive structure modeling (ISM) technique. By using Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) technique, eleven identified factors were further classified into three different types of variables: means, consequences, and ends. The findings of this study have significant theoretical and practical implications to both researchers and managers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An Exploration of the Identification of Implicative Dilemmas and Their Relationship to Personal Construct Theory-Congruent Measures of Psychological Well-Being in Nonclinical Samples
AN  - 1030252148
AB  - Studies using George Kelly's repertory grid method have indicated a possible relationship between psychological well-being and a variety of measures of conflict and inconsistencies. This study examined the relationship between implicative dilemmas, defined as cognitive conflicts in which implicit associations between desired and undesired states prevent persons from actualizing their ideal selves, and measures of psychological distress assessing psychological states consistent with personal construct theory (PCT), including novel single-item measures of anxiety, guilt, self-esteem, and constriction versus dilation. The use of measures designed to assess various potentially distressing psychological states as described by Kelly rather than traditional measures of psychological distress states was advocated as a means of assessing these phenomena in a way that more accurately reflects both PCT and human experience. The study also differentiated between implicative dilemmas in which a desired change along a self-construct was perceived as possible (resolvable implicative dilemmas) and those in which desired changed was perceived as impossible (unresolvable implicative dilemmas). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that implicative dilemmas accounted for significant unique variance in Anxiety and Guilt scores on the single-item measures as well as grid-based self-esteem scores only when unresolvable dilemmas were removed, suggesting that the perceived resolvability of self-discrepancies involved in implicative dilemmas may be key to assessing the relationship between implicative dilemmas and psychological distress. Namely, it is suggested that the cost of change assumed in the concept of implicative dilemmas may also be seen as a consolation when desired change is viewed as impossible.

T1  - Construing the Meaning of Authenticity in University Teaching: Comparing Explicit to Implicit Theories
AN  - 1030251993
AB  - Although recent literature on university teaching highlights "authenticity" as an important concept, the meaning of this complex notion remains elusive. Sternberg (1990) proposed that we gain deeper insight into phenomena that are assumed to be of profound meaning but remain insufficiently understood if, alongside explicit theories of experts, we also consider the implicit theories of nonspecialists. This repertory grid study explored with a sample of lecturers their personal conceptions of authenticity in teaching and how these compare to explicit theories developed by educationalists and philosophers. Implications for theory and professional development, as well as future directions for research, are offered.

T1  - Self-Construction, Cognitive Conflicts, and Disordered Eating Attitudes in Young Women
AN  - 1030251938
AB  - The aim of this study is to identify cognitive variables that predict disordered eating attitudes in a nonclinical sample composed of 50 female university students. Repertory grid technique was used to assess cognitive features of self-construing and cognitive conflicts. Drive for Thinness and Body Dissatisfaction scales from the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 were used as dependent variables, as previous studies suggested that high scores on these scales are associated with the risk of developing or aggravating eating syndromes. Results suggest that drive for thinness can be associated with cognitive conflicts, whereas body dissatisfaction may be higher for those who construct themselves as inadequate and similar to others. In addition, both dependent variables were predicted by being younger and having a higher body mass index.

T1  - Generational cohorts' expectations in the workplace: A study of New Zealanders: Journal of the Institue of Personnel Management Australia
AN  - 909471473
AB  - It has been suggested in the media and popular press that there are differences between the generational cohorts (Veterans, Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y) and that organisations need to manage people from each cohort differently. However, the evidence is largely anecdotal. This study investigates whether the popular characterisations of generational cohorts are valid, using qualitative and linear discriminant analysis. 164 participants completed a 69-item questionnaire developed from an independent sample of 64 repertory-grid interviews in which interviewees described their ideal job. More similarities than differences were found: only 8 of the 69 constructs provided a reasonable level of discrimination between generational cohorts. Our results challenge the popular depictions of generational cohorts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Amazing Diversity of Thought: A Qualitative Study on How Human Resource Practitioners Perceive Selection Procedures
AN  - 902679414
AB  - In the field of personnel selection, a great deal of evidence shows a gap between what scientists think practitioners should do and which procedures practitioners actually use. To build a basis for an intensified dialog between practitioners and researchers, there is a need for better knowledge about how practitioners think about selection procedures.

              
The authors used the repertory grid technique, a well-established interview method that elicits cognitions. Forty human resource practitioners were interviewed.

              
The results highlight the diversity of the individual ways in which practitioners think about selection procedures. First, none of the constructs elicited was mentioned by two-thirds of the interviewees or more, and only five were mentioned by half or more of the interviewees. Second, interviewees often did not agree which construct pole they preferred. Third, individual maps of the constructs and procedures revealed many differences. Sample constructs were whether a procedure reveals something about the status quo or something about a candidate's past, whether the human resource department has an active or a passive role in the selection process, and whether or not a procedure is fakable. The results suggest many new research questions and will hopefully foster the dialog between scientists and practitioners. This is one of the first studies to explore practitioners' cognitions regarding selection procedures, and represents a rare application of the repertory grid technique to the selection field.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Customer experience quality: an exploration in business and consumer contexts using repertory grid technique
AN  - 902220615
AB  - This study proposes a conceptual model for customer experience quality and its impact on customer relationship outcomes. Customer experience is conceptualized as the customer's subjective response to the holistic direct and indirect encounter with the firm, and customer experience quality as its perceived excellence or superiority. Using the repertory grid technique in 40 interviews in B2B and B2C contexts, the authors find that customer experience quality is judged with respect to its contribution to value-in-use, and hence propose that value-in-use mediates between experience quality and relationship outcomes. Experience quality includes evaluations not just of the firm's products and services but also of peer-to-peer and complementary supplier encounters. In assessing experience quality in B2B contexts, customers place a greater emphasis on firm practices that focus on understanding and delivering value-in-use than is generally the case in B2C contexts. Implications for practitioners' customer insight processes and future research directions are suggested.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A pilot study on conducting mobile learning activities for clinical nursing courses based on the repertory grid approach
AN  - 904536884
AB  - In clinical nursing courses, students are trained to identify the status of the target patients. The mastery of such ability and skills is very important since patients frequently need to be cared for immediately. In this pilot study, a repertory grid-oriented clinical mobile learning system is developed for a nursing training program. With the assistance of the mobile learning system, the nursing school students are able to learn in an authentic learning scenario, in which they can physically face the target patients, with the personal guidance and supplementary materials from the learning system to support them. To show the effectiveness of this innovative approach, an experiment has been conducted on the "respiratory system" unit of a nursing course. The experimental results show that the innovative approach is helpful to students in improving their learning achievements. Moreover, from the questionnaire surveys, it was found that most students showed favorable attitudes toward the usage of the mobile learning system and their participation in the training program.

T1  - A framework of students' reasons for using CMC media in learning contexts: A structural approach
AN  - 900528461
AB  - Motivated by the increasing popularity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) media in university students' learning, this study employs a four-stage novel approach for analyzing and developing a structured hierarchy framework for students' usage of CMC media in learning contexts. First, media characteristics and the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach were adopted to understand student-specific reasons for using media. Second, a set of relevant data concerning the university students' reasons for using CMC media was collected by the Repertory Grid Interview Technique (RGT) and analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. The Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique was then used to develop a six-level hierarchical structural model of media use reasons. Finally, the cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) technique was used to analyze the driver and dependence power for each media use reason and identify the hidden and indirect relationships among all reasons. The reasons related to students' use of CMC were classified as independent variables, linkage variables, and dependent variables. The study provides a validated typology of different clusters of interrelated students' reasons for using CMC media in learning contexts. The findings of this study will have significant implications and will be helpful for researchers, university policy-makers, instructors, and organizations in framing CMC technology implementation and use strategies.

T1  - Evaluation of a preventive drug education program in Hong Kong using the Repertory Grid Method
AN  - 1711196352
AB  - The repertory grid method based on personal construct psychology was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Project Astro in Hong Kong. Thirty participants (N=30) were invited to complete a repertory grid that was based on personal construct theory to provide both quantitative and qualitative data in measuring self-identity changes after joining the program. Both quantitative and qualitative data generated from the grid method showed that the participants perceived positive changes in the self-representation system joining the program. This study provides additional support for the effectiveness of Project Astro in the Chinese context. This study also shows that repertory grid method is a useful evaluation method to measure self-identity changes in participants in drug prevention programs.

T1  - Personal Usability Constructs: How People Construe Usability Across Nationalities and Stakeholder Groups
AN  - 879336219
AB  - Whereas the concept of usability is predominantly defined analytically, people relate to systems through personal usability constructs. Based on 48 repertory-grid interviews, this study investigates how such personal constructs are affected by two factors crucial to the international development and uptake of systems: nationality (Chinese, Danish, or Indian) and stakeholder group (developer or user). We find no significant overall difference across nationalities, but further analyses suggest that conventional usability aspects such as ease of use and simplicity are prominent for Chinese and Danish but not Indian participants and that a distinction between work and leisure-related communication is central to Chinese and Indian but not Danish participants. For stakeholder groups, we find a significant overall difference between developers and users. Unlike developers, users associate ease of use with leisure and, conversely, difficulty in use with work-relatedness. Further, users perceive usefulness as related to frustration and separate from ease of use, whereas developers construe usefulness, fun, and ease of use as related. In construing usability, participants make use of several constructs that are not part of prevailing usability definitions, including usefulness, fun, and security. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Managing web projects in academic libraries
AN  - 898964480
AB  - The activities used "rarely" or "never" by 50% or more of respondents - or in other words, used by the fewest respondents - were computing return on investment/analyzing cost-benefit, writing a software quality assurance test plan, creating a PERT chart, requiring change request forms, creating a [Gantt] chart or schedule, and budgeting for outsourcing, hardware, software. Responses related to budgeting for in-house staff time were in almost-equal proportions: about as many did this "frequently" or "sometimes" as "rarely" or "never."              The respondents were asked to indicate if members of the committee included "representatives from throughout your library" (hereafter referred to as "representatives"), "technical and design professionals" (hereafter referred to as "web professionals"), or "other" with a text entry option. The majority of the 59 committees described included representatives (85%) and web professionals (64%), with 56% of them including both representatives and web professionals. Twenty-nine percent of the groups were composed of representatives without web professionals, while only a small number (8%) were web professionals without representatives. Among the "other" text responses, 7% of the groups included administrators and 3% included students.              This survey supports existing literature about the myriad ways web project management fits into someone's job and into a library organization. Based on this survey's results, web projects in academic libraries are often managed by the same individuals, but they hold numerous types of positions in a wide variety of library departments. Information technology and systems-related departments predominate, but many people work in public services or administration. Even people who claim to manage "all" or "most" of their library's web projects have plenty of job responsibilities that are not web-project-related, and in this group, project management is likely not to be listed as a job responsibility - only 31% of those who managed "all" or "most" of their institution's web projects include it in their job descriptions. Yet, they spend an average of 36% of their time on management activities such as project planning, communicating, and implementing. In fact, of all respondents, only 39% have project management included in their job descriptions. In addition, the group that manage "all or most" projects also frequently engage in web development activities, are responsible for the library web site and support or train others in web-related tasks. It is somewhat disturbing to think such people are doing so without having this in their job descriptions. This suggests project management came about not by intention, but as a result of their other web roles. These findings highlight a need for libraries to review job descriptions where project management duties may have become a regular part of the job. Libraries also need to review job descriptions for those who engage in web development activities to be sure these duties are explicitly stated. In addition to ensuring an accurate description of the job, this ensures individuals have time, official authority, and appropriate skills to engage in these mission-critical activities. In some cases, libraries may need to create new position descriptions to support web project management. While most libraries struggle to add new positions, there may be opportunities to redefine an existing job when someone retires or is interested in exploring a new area of expertise.              4 Barry Z.

T1  - Towards a conceptualisation of quality in information technology projects
AN  - 871037748
AB  - Quality has been extensively studied in repetitive operations, but it remains under-researched in projects. The uncertainty and dynamics of projects challenge the principles of quality developed for repetitive operations, and call for project-tailored solutions. This article explores the attributes of quality in projects, based on interviews conducted within a large IT-services company. An adapted repertory grid was used to investigate the understanding of quality by comparing concrete examples of projects considered as high or low quality. Eight attributes of quality were identified, which indicate a tension between a mechanistic standpoint of quality, and the need to incorporate less tangible aspects. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Childhood Sexual Abuse and Construction of Self and Others in People Who have Experienced Psychosis
AN  - 867912278
AB  - This study aimed to investigate how childhood sexual abuse (CSA) affects self-construction and construction of other people in people who have experienced psychosis. A sample of 21 such people was divided into 2 groups, according to whether they had experienced CSA or not. They were compared on repertory grids that included the element "self now" and elements that represented other people. The results provided little evidence to support the hypotheses that people who had experienced CSA had lower levels of self-elaboration, saw themselves less like other people, or had greater conflict in their self-concept. The results are discussed with regard to limitations in the study and use of measures of conflict and elaboration in clinical practice.

T1  - Cognitive Conflict and Consensus Generation in Virtual Teams During Knowledge Capture: Comparative Effectiveness of Techniques: JMIS JMIS
AN  - 1366388131
AB  - Effective knowledge management has been increasingly cited as critical for businesses to compete successfully. Knowledge acquisition/capture, the first step in knowledge management, continues to be a bottleneck and is exacerbated when experts are geographically distributed. Furthermore, knowledge from multiple experts is likely to generate inconsistent knowledge for a given problem domain. There is thus a compelling need to generate consensus by resolving inconsistencies and conflicts that may occur among experts during the process of knowledge acquisition. This process is more challenging when dealing with virtual teams of experts. This study addresses task-based or cognitive conflicts among experts. A key objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two cognitive techniques -- the repertory grid (or RepGrid) and Delphi -- in generating consensus among experts during the knowledge capture process. A field experiment with geographically distributed real-world network experts involving multiple rounds of interaction over an extended period of time was conducted. Findings from this research indicate that, in the short run, Delphi works better than the RepGrid in reducing conflict and generating consensus. However, the RepGrid technique appears to perform better in the long run. We find similar results for satisfaction with the process and outcome. Our findings also indicate that experts using the RepGrid technique elicited more knowledge as well as higher-quality knowledge than experts using the Delphi technique. To sum up, our study indicates that RepGrid is superior to Delphi, and therefore managers should seriously consider the use of RepGrid in capturing knowledge from multiple and distributed experts when dealing with complex real-world issues.

AB  - Several authors have emphasized the need to explore issues related to self in these patients. The repertory grid technique (RGT), derived from personal construct theory, is a method designed to assess the patient's construction of self and others. A group of women with fibromyalgia (n= 30) and a control group (n= 30) were assessed using RGT. Women with fibromyalgia also completed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and a visual-analogue scale for pain, and painful tender points were explored. suggest that these women had a higher present self-ideal self discrepancy and a lower perceived adequacy of others, and it was more likely to find implicative dilemmas among them compared to controls.

T1  - Trading-up mass-market goods to luxury products: AMJ AMJ AMJ
AN  - 878893621
AB  - This paper addresses the current lack of consensus on what defines a luxury product. It demonstrates the adequacy of a consumer-oriented approach anchored in a list of product attributes. These attributes were identified from the literature and a study of 31 German millionaires with high spending on luxury goods. A combination of five research methodologies was employed including open interview, the repertory grid method (RGM), the preference differences technique, the critical incident technique and the projective technique. The findings suggest that consumers distinguish luxury products using six major characteristics: price, quality, aesthetics, rarity, extraordinariness, and symbolic meaning. The paper concludes with practical implications for luxury brand managers and for those who wish to trade up their mass-market goods. Suggestions for further research directions are also offered.

T1  - Understanding the antecedents to public interest and engagement with heritage
AN  - 864090338
AB  - Purpose - Attempts to increase public participation in heritage-related activities have had mixed success. This research seeks to understand the degree to which people value heritage, what influenced their degree of engagement with heritage and what elements of a heritage item impacted upon the value attached to it by the public. Design/methodology/approach - Focus groups and repertory grid analysis were used to gain a sense of how people defined heritage and the factors that influenced their perceptions and involvement. A survey of a nationally representative sample of over 3,200 people was then conducted to empirically test these findings. Findings - The results emphasise that people are highly motivated to engage in heritage activities that they find directly relevant to their own specific interests, culture or history. Heritage was defined broadly, encompassing a wide range of objects, places and experiences, summarised here under 15 categories. The key criteria in determining whether a particular object was viewed as being worthy of heritage protection were its perceived importance to the nation, personal relevance, irreplaceability and uniqueness. Research limitations/implications - The data is limited to the Australian context, and the approach should be replicated in other nations to examine generalisability of results. The complex way in which the public defines heritage means that much work is still to be done to understand how the various attributes of a heritage item interrelate to influence its perceived value. Practical implications - This paper includes implications for heritage managers, specifically on how to educate and support the public connection with heritage by encouraging them to build personal connections through experience, storytelling and celebrations. Originality/value - Through its use of multiple methods of data collection, and inclusion of oft-overlooked groups, this study presents a rare "national" perspective on public views of heritage and how they are formed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An investigation of attitudes of students and teachers about participating in a context-aware ubiquitous learning activity
AN  - 860228889
AB  - In recent years, digital learning has been converting from e-learning to m-learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with mobile devices. Consequently, context-aware ubiquitous learning (u-learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless, mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in the learning process. In this paper, a context-aware u-learning environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition, we probe the feasibility of context-aware u-learning in courses by soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable of enhancing students' motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover, it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better control of class order.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Management Science; New Findings Reported from K. Goffin and Co-Authors Describe Advances in Management Science
AN  - 862871967
AB  - Post-project reviews (PPRs) are recognized as a highly effective mechanism for stimulating learning in NPD teams but, surprisingly, neither the typical ''lessons learnt'' that emerge from PPRs nor the role of tacit knowledge in NPD learning have previously been studied. To address this gap, five in-depth case studies were conducted at leading German companies. Three main sources of data were used: interviews with experienced NPD personnel using repertory grid technique, inspection of company process and project documentation, and observations of PPR discussions. Systematic coding of the qualitative data was conducted by two researchers working in parallel and verified through checks involving independent researchers. The coding process identified the lessons learnt and also the usage of metaphors and stories (which signifies tacit knowledge generation). The lessons that NPD personnel perceive to be the most important were identified from the repertory grid data. These included: knowing how to deal with project budgets, solving technical problems, meeting schedules, resource management, and managing organizational complexity.

T1  - Self-Construction and Interpersonal Distances of Juveniles Living in Residential Communities
AN  - 858633093
AB  - Within the framework of constructivism, and more specifically personal construct psychology, the current research aims at exploring self-construction and interpersonal relationships of juveniles living in residential communities. It proposes a method of doing so that is coherent with the framework adopted. Repertory grids were used with 59 youths, ages 9 to 20 years, and 176 significant others (father, mother, houseparent, and a teacher or employer); interpersonal distances were measured. Identification with others and an authority, perceived change, self and social acceptance, social negativity, self-fulfillment, commonality, and sociality led to the discrimination of different profiles that indicate different (inter)personal configurations.

T1  - Filipino Arts Among Elders in Institutionalized Care Settings
AN  - 880188920
AB  - The use of traditional art in recreational therapies is unexplored. This paper, thus, attempts to surface the unique power of traditional Filipino arts (TFA) as synergizing lens in capturing the individual and the collective experiences of a select group of Filipino elderly in an institutionalized care setting relative to their feelings of depression and self-esteem. Three Filipino elderly housed in an institutionalized care setting were chosen for this phenomenological study, a robotfoto and a series of semistructured interviews constitute the main data gathering tool. Field texts were subjected to phenomenological reduction via the repertory grid analysis. Emerged themes were subjected to a series of member checking procedures to ensure the trustworthiness of the reported data. Depression and self-esteem were interpreted via two emerged themes. The themes were Me, Myself, and Melancholy and Will Not Let My Worth Wither. Through recreational therapies in the form of traditional Filipino arts, participants found novel psychological crutches that overcame the challenges of depression and give them hope toward more positive views of themselves and life.

T1  - Tacit Knowledge, Lessons Learnt, and New Product Development
AN  - 853750165
AB  - New product development (NPD) is a complex activity that is dependent on knowledge and learning. Post-project reviews (PPRs) are recognized as a highly effective mechanism for stimulating learning in NPD teams but, surprisingly, neither the typical "lessons learnt" that emerge from PPRs nor the role of tacit knowledge in NPD learning have previously been studied. To address this gap, five in-depth case studies were conducted at leading German companies. Three main sources of data were used: interviews with experienced NPD personnel using repertory grid technique, inspection of company process and project documentation, and observations of PPR discussions. Tacit knowledge is a popular management concept but one that is poorly understood, as empirical evidence to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical concepts is sadly lacking. This provides a unique opportunity for NPD scholars -- they have the ideal arena in which a deeper understanding of tacit knowledge can be generated.

T1  - Obituary: Fay Fransella: Pioneer of a radical people-centred theory of psychology
AN  - 854030352
AB  - Professor [Fay Adah Rachel Fransella], who has died aged 85, devoted most of her life to promoting a view of psychology centred on people. Personal construct psychology (PCP), a radical approach developed by an American, George Kelly, was for Fay something of an oasis in the "psychological desert" she found during her clinical training. The introductory book that she wrote on it with Don Bannister, Inquiring Man (1971), inspired a generation of psychologists, including me, who had become disillusioned by university courses dominated by behavioural approaches.              The book's message was that psychology could actually be about people, whose views, or constructions, of the world should be taken seriously, rather than about rats and pigeons. Not only that, but people could actively make choices about their worlds rather than being passive victims of their histories or biochemistry. Other highly influential books among Fay's more than 100 publications included A Manual for Repertory Grid Technique (1977), with Bannister and Richard Bell, detailing the approach's principal assessment method, and the International Handbook of Personal Construct Psychology (2003), which she edited.

T1  - Small-Business Owner-Managers' Perceptions of Business Ethics and CSR-Related Concepts: JBE JBE
AN  - 840670181
AB  - Recent academic articles point to an increased vagueness and overlap in concepts related to business ethics and corporate responsibility. Further, the perception of these notions can differ in the small-business world from the original academic definitions. This article focuses on the cognition of small-business owner-managers. Given the impact of small-business owner-managers on their ventures, corporate responsibility and ethical issues can take a different route in SMEs. The small-business owner-manager is able to shape the corporate culture and to enact values other than profit. Adopting a cognitive perspective, we have identified how the small-business owner-manager makes sense of notions linked to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business ethics. The concept of sensemaking has recently been applied to CSR (Basu and Pallazzo, 2008; Cramer et al., 2006). Applying a cognitive perspective to small-business owners may help in explaining specific phenomena found within small-business ownership. For this research, the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) is used, a method that has not previously been widely applied in the business and society field.              Our findings to an extent invalidate the confusion in terminology found in the academic literature. Small-business owner-managers, pragmatically and rather clearly, differentiate among the various concepts related to corporate responsibility and business ethics but, at the same time, they recognise the interrelationships and interdependencies of these concepts. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how small-business owners think and integrate corporate responsibility and ethical issues into their decision-making.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

It is essential to consider mechanical/electrical requirements from the early stages of design; and many experienced architects acknowledge this knowledge entities and the necessity for considering them at the right time. Therefore, inefficient knowledge flow among professionals during architectural conceptual design is emphasized as a problem for this study. For overcoming this problem, the study intends to improve knowledge capture during conceptual design phase of building projects by formalizing the fundamental requirements of necessary mechanical/electrical knowledge during this phase. To achieve this goal, this research develop three objectives: 1) Specify an appropriate knowledge capture technique for tacit dominated conceptual design phase; 2) Identify fundamental mechanical/electrical requirements to consider by architects during conceptual design phase; and 3) Develop a framework for formalizing tacit mechanical/electrical knowledge during conceptual design phase. Firstly, the study selects an appropriate technique to capture expert’s tacit knowledge based on a literature survey by matching existing knowledge capture techniques with conceptual design characteristics. Secondly, mechanical/electrical knowledge is obtained through a case study during conceptual design of a green building project. The mechanical/electrical knowledge and activities are matched in the McMillan Framework (2001) for the conceptual design phase. Later, mechanical/electrical knowledge is matched and assigned to the architectural concept design activities. At the conclusion of the exercise, the study developed a mechanical/electrical knowledge-based framework for the conceptual design phase. Validation of the results was obtained by using computational organizational theory simulation. This study contributes in extending McMillan’s Framework to include explicit fundamental required mechanical/electrical knowledge during the conceptual design phase; developing a tacit knowledge capture technique by combining tacit observation and explicit repertory grid documentation; and improving Nissen’s (2006) multidimensional model (MDM) by integrating knowledge into Macmillan’s framework for conceptual design activities. These results support the need to mitigate potential knowledge losses in tacit-dominant area between experts during conceptual design phase of building projects.

T1  - Cognitive Factors in Fibromyalgia: The Role of Self-Concept and Identity Related Conflicts
AN  - 858632581
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by the presence of diffuse and chronic musculoskeletal pain of unknown etiology. Clinical diagnosis and the merely palliative treatments considerably affect the patient's experience and the chronic course of the disease. Therefore, several authors have emphasized the need to explore issues related to self in these patients. The repertory grid technique (RGT), derived from personal construct theory, is a method designed to assess the patient's construction of self and others. A group of women with fibromyalgia (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30) were assessed using RGT. Women with fibromyalgia also completed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and a visual-analogue scale for pain, and painful tender points were explored. Results suggest that these women had a higher present self-ideal self discrepancy and a lower perceived adequacy of others, and it was more likely to find implicative dilemmas among them compared to controls. These dilemmas are a type of cognitive conflict in which the symptom is construed as "enmeshed" with positive characteristics of the self. Finally, implications of these results for the psychological treatment of fibromyalgia are suggested to give a more central role to self-identity issues and to the related cognitive conflicts.

T1  - Complexity Tools For Smart Grids: PCT And ABM Join Forces
AN  - 1349794950
AB  - This paper presents an innovative way of combining existing complexity tools to offer a better description of the diffusion of distributed electricity generation and Smart Grid. These complexity tools are Personal Construct Theory (PCT) and Agent Based Modeling (ABM). The primary value of ABM is that it permits multiple iterations of a model using slightly different input conditions (or variables), demonstrating how small changes can be amplified as the dynamics of the system evolve. The challenge for ABM is to accurately capture the behavior (or rules) of individuals (or agents). Agent rules and associated variables in existing models are determined using a wide variety of research methods which are not usually stated explicitly. The culminating rules are often mechanical, treating agents as automaton, and so do not reflect the complex emergence of new variables in the system being modelled. PCT, and its associated structured interview methodology called Repertory Grid Technique, elicits from respondents a set of constructs which reflects how individuals understand their behavior (towards electricity generation and consumption), consciously or otherwise. The constructs of multiple respondents provide a legitimate set of increasingly mature constructs which describe evolving rules for differentiated behavior in Smart Grid adoption. These agent rules, together with environmental information, such as the technological trajectories of products, political/regulatory incentives/taxes, economic wealth, population structure, climate information and housing stock, allow the ABM to be developed for a particular region or country. Running the ABM will show barriers to adoption and allow interventions to be tested in order to speed an emerging landscape of increased distributed energy generation and more use of renewables. Importantly, interventions will be linked to both sustained, behavioral change and contextual settings making for a more robust description of the diffusion of Smart Grid. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - On identity reformation and local transition: a case from Poland
AN  - 763662906
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the process of successful introduction of total quality management (TQM) in Poland and the way in which it impacted on identity of Polish managers. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a combination of ethnographic research and repertory grid interviews. Findings - The process of TQM introduction and implementation is examined through the application of translation as a model incorporating cultural and socio-economical dimensions in addition to individual and organizational levels that shaped the development of TQM in Poland. It then draws on the idea of fantasy as theorized in Lacanian psychoanalysis in order to incorporate the unconscious element of translation process which is missing from Latour's theorization and which forms an important aspect of adoption of new technology and the emergence of a new post-transition generation of managers in Poland. The paper argues that a complex combination of contextual factors, amongst them the notion of fantasy shaped the process of translation of TQM to Poland, the identity formation of Polish managers and to the emergence of a new post-transition generation of managers in Poland. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature on the post-command transition by illustrating this process through the fantasy of total quality management explored in a specific socio-cultural and geographical context and by combining the idea of Latour's translation with Lacanian fantasy.

T1  - Important characteristics of software development team members: an empirical investigation using Repertory Grid
AN  - 1766831288
AB  - An information system is typically developed by a team of information systems (IS) professionals. Research shows that teams staffed with the right people are more likely to be effective and efficient. There is a paucity of study that examines the important traits of IS professionals in team contexts. The objective of this research is to identify and understand the important characteristics of good team members in software development projects. We applied an established psychological technique (Repertory Grid) to guide our interviews with 21 experienced IS professionals, who have had extensive experience in software development teams. The comprehensive list of important characteristics was analysed qualitatively using open coding method of grounded theory. Fifty-nine unique characteristics were identified and classified into eight categories. Among them, attitude/motivation, knowledge, interpersonal/communication skills, and working/cognitive ability were perceived by research participants to be the most important categories. Our study provides a context-specific (i.e. software development team) evaluation of important characteristics of IS professionals. The results have significant implications for IS recruiting, IS training, IS staffing, and IS human resource management. Our study also supplements the research on management of IS development teams.

T1  - Midpoint Ratings on Personal Constructs: Constriction or the Middle Way?
AN  - 858632511
AB  - Midpoint ratings of elements on personal constructs have been given various interpretations, and the placement of the ideal self at the midpoint of a construct has been viewed as violating Kelly's (1955) dichotomy and choice corollaries. This article reports analyses, using a mixed models approach, of repertory grids completed by 80 clients referred to a clinical psychology service at up to five assessment points both pre- and posttherapy. A larger than expected number of ideal self ratings at the midpoint was found, and consideration of the content of several of the constructs concerned elucidated why it might have been that neither pole was preferred. Midpoint ratings of the ideal self increased over the course of therapy and were not associated with depression or anxiety. Midpoint ratings of the ideal self and self now were also related to various structural measures of construing. Theoretical and clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - The Convergent Validity of Structural Measures of Differentiation Derived from Repertory Grids
AN  - 858632458
AB  - Within repertory grid research multiple measures of differentiation referring to the relative number of judgments have been in use to assess the structure of personal construct systems. Extant research reports correlations between some of the structural measures being studied. However, a comprehensive investigation documenting how the most commonly used measures of differentiation correlate does not exist, thus raising questions about the measures' convergent validity. In this study, we examine the convergent validity between percentage of variance explained by the first factor (PVAFF), intensity, cognitive complexity-simplicity, functionally independent construction (FIC), and number of factors. Our findings suggest significant correlations between the structural measures of differentiation, and a psychometric assessment yields an internally consistent one-factor solution. These results support the convergent validity of the five structural measures of differentiation. With the exception of cognitive complexity-simplicity, grid size is associated with the other four structural measures of differentiation.

T1  - Innovating entrepreneurial pedagogy: examples from France and Germany
AN  - 762696586
AB  - Purpose - This paper - one of only a few examples - aims to conduct a cross-national research into innovative teaching approaches in entrepreneurship in France and Germany. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on two cross-cultural cases and reflects on the experiences of two innovative teaching approaches in two European settings. The underlying aim of this investigation is to identify commonalities and differences between the approaches, establish learning between the different Higher Education institutions as well as to investigate the transferability of such approaches to other cultural environments. Findings - This research has highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary learning in entrepreneurship research. Whereas, in the German case, management and other disciplines work together to create the example of the "practice firm", in the French case entrepreneurship theories, network theories and cognitive science are brought together to create a new approach to learning about entrepreneurship. Both approaches highlight the importance of the personal development of the course participants by empowering the student to be proactive. Research limitations/implications - The paper builds on the early experiences with both the concept of the "practice firm" and the application of repertory grids in entrepreneurial pedagogy, which justifies the highly exploratory character of this research. More research is necessary to establish students' opinion about such innovative approaches, also on a cross-national level. Practical implications - The paper provides examples of effective practices for encouraging entrepreneurial thinking in the classroom. More such comparative work is necessary on a European, but also on a wider international, scale to encourage learning, in particular for those involved in teaching entrepreneurship, but also for policy makers who are looking for new ways to stimulate entrepreneurial thinking. Originality/value - The paper is innovative as it compares and contrasts two innovative approaches to teaching entrepreneurship in two European countries and hence fills a gap in the literature.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Applying repertory grids technique for knowledge elicitation in quality function deployment
AN  - 751868784
AB  - The repertory grids technique is applied in quality function deployment to elicit the voice of the customers and to derive the importance for each customer requirement from a group of customers. In addition, the repertory grids technique can be used in the relationship matrix to quantify the numerical relationships between customer requirements and technical measures from a group of team members. An integration of the repertory grids technique and quality function deployment would make quality function deployment systematically to gather customer needs for better product or service planning and to determine the relationships between customer requirements and technical measures since the final analyses rely heavily on the results of this relationship matrix. A case illustration is provided to show the usefulness of applying the repertory grids technique in quality function deployment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Study on Tacit Knowledge of Life Planner in Selling Process Research via Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 2001084017
AB  - Life planner is seen as “knowledge worker”, which provides professional services are difficult to express explicitly. For technical aspect of selling process, in addition to life planner’s professional knowledge, to learn and accumulate the experience have to via personal long-period selling experience, community and exchange interaction, and senior’s inheritance. The purpose of this research is focus on tacit knowledge of life planner in selling process research via Repertory Grid Technique. The result shows there was cognition difference existed inevitable among each of the life planners, there are four dimensions: Sale Adaptation, Relationship Capacity、Emotional intelligence and Professional Knowledge, and we can find out the reason and constructs extracted from Repertory Grid Technique. In fact, all the life planners have their personal cognition of sale techniques; moreover, the meaning and interpretation of these sale elements cognitions are difference between experts and non-experts. This research give some advices for people who want to become a life planner, to well know about these four dimensions and familiar with the techniques in each step are necessary. Overall, the concept of life planner can be helpful to well know the tacit knowledge which might be used during personal selling process. Furthermore, it can also make the fresh to understand the meaning and method, so that they can have the technique of selling process and get involved in life planner’s professional domain effectively.

All participants were assessed using Repertory Grid Technique (RGT). In BN patients it was more common (71.9%) to find IDs than in controls (18.8%). They also showed higher polarization and higher self-ideal discrepancies (even more for those with a long history of BN). The measures provided by the RGT can be useful for the assessment of self-construction and cognitive conflicts in BN patients and to appreciate their role in this disorder," wrote G.

T1  - The Use of the Repertory Grid for Collaboration and Reflection in a Research Context
AN  - 745954547
AB  - The Repertory Grid (RepGrid) technique has been used extensively in Management Sciences research, including Information Systems research, in order to reveal the personal views of individual research subjects regarding the issue being studied. These individual constructs are then used to propose criteria for success amongst other things. This paper uses a distinctly different form of RepGrid, renamed a Reflection Grid, as a collaboration tool. Members of a research team use this new technique to probe their individual understanding of what happened and what was achieved during a research event and then to share these insights. Hence, not only is the application new (reflection and construction of shared meaning rather than the analysis and synthesis of personal constructs) but the original grid technique has evolved.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Exploring the evaluation framework of strategic information systems using repertory grid technique: a cognitive perspective from chief information officers
AN  - 744471334
AB  - This study aims at developing an evaluation framework of strategic information systems (SIS) and evaluating the SIS planning and implementation by using a cognitive approach called the repertory grid technique. The findings are based on in-depth interviews with chief information officers (CIOs) involved with SIS developments in their organisations. This exploratory study builds on a cognitive methodology and enables us to develop the evaluation framework of SIS within the CIO's mind. In a practical viewpoint, we evaluated the effectiveness of the essential activities in the SIS planning and implementation. Results showed that activities on analysing industry and environment, analysing information system weakness and strength, formulating SIS strategy, identifying SIS initiatives, prioritising and allocating resources for SIS, documenting SIS, and liaising with top management team are well performed.

T1  - Management Psychology; New management psychology study findings recently were reported by researchers at University of Surrey
AN  - 577311977
AB  - Design/methodology/approach Using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique, ten managers reflected systematically on their feedback seeking in an organizational context. A grounded theory framework was used to identify higher-order cross-case constructs.

T1  - Cultural and Biological Determinants in the Evaluation of Urban Green Spaces
AN  - 580117788
AB  - Dramatically increasing urbanization is observable worldwide and brings pressure on space within urban areas as the built environment intensifies. Considerable evidence suggests that contact with nature is important for city dwellers, although it is not known whether residents' appreciation of the forms of urban green spaces is constant across different contexts. More specifically, it has not yet been shown whether our appreciation of nature is innate and inherently human, is cultural and something that we learn, or is a mixture of both. This article describes an exploratory study consisting of 17 interviews carried out in Zurich, Switzerland. Kelly's repertory grid technique is used to identify preferred urban landscapes, which were contrasted with identified rejected landscapes. Principle components analysis and multidimensional scaling reveal a clear separation of cultural and biological modes of landscape assessment in some respondents. The research contributes to an understanding of the meanings of urban green spaces, which would in turn provide planners with a tool to match urban natural resource management with the needs of residents.

T1  - Evaluation of visual video summaries: user-supplied constructs and descriptions
AN  - 898689611
AB  - Issue Title: Focused Issue on ECDL 2010

              
Evaluation of video summarization approaches requires more information on the user-perceived qualities of different types of summaries. Also, evaluation measures need to be further developed in a user-led manner. This article reports on a user-centered evaluation of visual video summaries. Four types of summaries (fastforward, user-controlled fastforward, scene clips, and storyboard) were evaluated with a set of existing performance and satisfaction measures. A repertory grid elicitation was conducted with our participants gathering evaluation constructs related to both video summary content and controls. Results showed a lack of correlation between performance and satisfaction measures. User-supplied evaluation constructs were shown to span both the performance and satisfaction dimensions of the video summary evaluation space. Most constructs achieved moderate to good inter-rater agreement in a consequent survey. Free descriptions of videos and respective summaries showed that while users are able to interpret object- and event-related information from short summaries, thematic inference lacked, leading to worse descriptions than for the full videos.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Holistic approach to learning and teaching introductory object-oriented programming
AN  - 880189210
AB  - This article describes a holistic approach to designing an introductory, object-oriented programming course. The design is grounded in constructivism and pedagogy of phenomenography. We use constructive alignment as the framework to align assessments, learning, and teaching with planned learning outcomes. We plan learning and teaching activities, and media with an understanding of variation theory and the ways in which students learn to program. We outline the implementation of the course, and discuss the findings from the first cycle of an action research study with a small sample of undergraduate students. An investigation of the preferred (deep/surface) learning approaches of the students led us to believe that these approaches can be influenced through course design. Personal constructs of the students, elicited through the repertory grid technique, revealed that rich inventories of learning resources are highly valued. We comment on the transformational processes of the experience of the participants, and identify areas for further refinement and investigation in the next action research cycle.

T1  - Heart Disease; Researchers' work from King's College London, Department of Psychology focuses on heart disease
AN  - 207509618
AB  - Adult smokers (n=18) completed interviews and questionnaires using the repertory grid technique to elicit personal constructs underlying perceptions of effectiveness of a range of medical interventions (three to stop smoking, three to prevent heart disease, one to reduce pain, one to lose weight, and one to treat depression). Principle components analysis was applied to identify the key underlying dimensions within the constructs. Numerical estimates of the effectiveness of the interventions were also collected from participants to compare them with the published evidence. Constructs clustered around three dimensions: 'therapeutic impact,' 'behavior-dependent impact,' and 'impact facilitates general health.' Smokers perceived impacts that are dependent on the individuals' behavior to offer small therapeutic impacts, while facilitating individuals' general health.

AB  - This paper uses an inductive approach to explore this issue. In Study 1, 25 repertory grid interviews and 3 focus groups encompassing lay public and health professionals identified 25 ways of describing health behaviours. These were refined into 11 key characteristics. In Study 2, 180 members of the general public rated 20 health behaviours on each of these characteristics. Principal components analysis indicated behaviours were perceived along three key dimensions: 'easy immediate pay-offs' versus 'effortful long-term pay-offs'; 'private unproblematic' versus 'public and problematic'; and 'important routines' versus 'unimportant one-offs'. Risk behaviours were clearly differentiated being perceived as 'easy immediate pay-offs' and 'public-problematic'.

T1  - "Catch me if you can?": A psychological analysis of managers' feedback seeking
AN  - 215871577
AB  - This paper aims to locate managerial feedback-seeking in a self-regulation model in which self-motivational considerations are uppermost. It seeks to use a qualitative psychological approach to address the question of when, what, how, from whom and why is feedback sought in a performance contingent managerial setting.  Using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique, ten managers reflected systematically on their feedback seeking in an organizational context. A grounded theory framework was used to identify higher-order cross-case constructs.  Managers sought performance feedback when they perceived uncertainty and difficulty in the pursuit of their managerial functions and were minded of their need to develop their management skills. Consistent with the instrumental model, feedback seeking was highly goal-oriented and self-affirmative in pursuit of increased managerial competence. However, the finding that adds most to the understanding on both an empirical and theoretical level is in showing how managers sought their feedback remotely, and from largely external sources, to reconcile development needs with self-protective considerations (i.e. image and ego-costs) in relation to subordinates and peers. These findings have implications for understanding feedback seeking as a multi-dimensional highly self-motivated process.  Qualitative research uses small samples and this limits their empirical generalizability; however, the paper's findings link with previous work indicating potential for hypothesis generation and theoretical development.  Questions are raised about whether managers feel able to seek performance feedback for learning and development purposes, without feeling threatened in their capability and worth as managers. The paper argues that the environment most conducive to feedback seeking is one in which managers feel "psychologically safe" rather than defensive about their capability.

T1  - Classifying health‐related behaviours: Exploring similarities and differences amongst behaviours
AN  - 2124787337
AB  - Objectives.  The classification of health behaviours may provide a useful framework for understanding their characteristics and therefore the ways in which they are similar and different. However, to date, little research has attempted to identify these characteristics and explore the dimensions along which behaviours differ. This paper uses an inductive approach to explore this issue.Design and methods.  In Study 1, 25 repertory grid interviews and 3 focus groups encompassing lay public and health professionals identified 25 ways of describing health behaviours. These were refined into 11 key characteristics. In Study 2, 180 members of the general public rated 20 health behaviours on each of these characteristics.Results.  Principal components analysis indicated behaviours were perceived along three key dimensions: ‘easy immediate pay‐offs’ versus ‘effortful long‐term pay‐offs’; ‘private unproblematic’ versus ‘public and problematic’; and ‘important routines’ versus ‘unimportant one‐offs’. Risk behaviours were clearly differentiated being perceived as ‘easy immediate pay‐offs’ and ‘public–problematic’. In contrast with other approach behaviours such as diet or self‐examination, physical activity behaviours were perceived as ‘effortful long‐term pay‐offs’.Conclusions.  This research provides an useful starting point in the development of a framework that allows us to better understand differences and similarities between health behaviours. These dimensions may be important to consider when researchers set out to predict or change behaviour.

T1  - The Operational Demand Evaluation Checklist (ODEC) of workload for railway signalling
AN  - 205287445
AB  - This paper is concerned with the interpretation and assessment of mental workload, and in particular assessment of the load imposed by the work system. It highlights a framework created to direct the development of workload assessment tools capable of assessing the dimensions most relevant to the population being studied, in our case railway signallers. A tool to capture the operational demands on the rail signaller was required to evaluate the load from the system they operated. This paper justifies the need for, and describes the development of, the Operational Demand Evaluation Checklist (ODEC), using techniques like repertory grid with active signallers. The practical experience of the development, evaluation, live use and validation of ODEC is discussed and the paper concludes by suggesting that the approach could be adopted to interpret the concept of workload in other work domains.

AB  - This study aims to explore general practitioners' perceptions of the nature of 'effectiveness'. The design was qualitative in nature using the repertory grid technique to elicit the constructs underlying the perceived effectiveness of a range of medical interventions. Eight medical interventions were used as stimuli (diclophenac to reduce acute pain, cognitive behaviour therapy to treat depression, weight loss surgery to achieve weight loss, diet and exercise to prevent type 2 diabetes, statins to prevent heart disease, stopping smoking to prevent heart disease, nicotine replacement therapy to stop smoking, and stop smoking groups to stop smoking). The setting involved face-to-face interviews followed by questionnaires in London Primary Care Trusts. included a random sample of 13 general practitioners. Analysis of the ratings showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: low patient effort versus high patient effort (dimension one), and small impact versus large impact (dimension two).

T1  - Identifying Competencies of Volunteer Board Members of Community Sports Clubs
AN  - 231498133
AB  - This study contributes to the emerging empirical studies on roles and responsibilities of boards in nonprofit organizations by identifying competencies of volunteer board members. We identified how two types of constituents - volunteer board members and sports members - perceived competencies of volunteer board members in community sports clubs. We used the repertory grid technique to draw cognitive maps and to reveal the perceived reality of these constituents. Our results suggest that constituents within a group share similar perceptions of competencies of outstanding performing board members, whereas they agree less on perceptions of poor performing board members. This study reveals that cognitive (e.g., having a long-term vision, having professionalism), emotional intelligence (e.g., being reliable, being honest), and social intelligence (e.g., listening to others, being jovial/nice to be with) competencies are necessary to be perceived as an outstanding performing board member.

AN  - 1928876949
AB  - This study contributes to the emerging empirical studies on roles and responsibilities of boards in nonprofit organizations by identifying competencies of volunteer board members. We identified how two types of constituents--volunteer board members and sports members--perceived competencies of volunteer board members in community sports clubs. We used the repertory grid technique to draw cognitive maps and to reveal the perceived reality of these constituents. Our results suggest that constituents within a group share similar perceptions of competencies of outstanding performing board members, whereas they agree less on perceptions of poor performing board members. This study reveals that cognitive (e.g., having a long-term vision, having professionalism), emotional intelligence (e.g., being reliable, being honest), and social intelligence (e.g., listening to others, being jovial/nice to be with) competencies are necessary to be perceived as an outstanding performing board member.

T1  - Mental Illness; Researchers from University of Wollongong detail new studies and findings in the area of mental illness
AN  - 194621958
AB  - Constructs related to recovery, as well as other recovery focused measures. Perceptions of one's ''ideal self'' represented more advanced recovery in contrast to perceptions of ''a person mentally unwell.'' Current perceptions of self were most similar to perceptions of ''usual self'' and least similar to ''a Person who is mentally unwell.'' Increased identification with one's ''ideal self'' reflected increased hopefulness in terms of recovery. The recovery repertory grid shows promise in clinical practice, in terms of exploring identity as a key variable within mental health recovery processes," wrote K. Buckleywalker and colleagues, University of Wollongong.

T1  - Information Overload or Information Under Siege: Filipino Faculty Extendees' Concept, Motivation and Expectations
AN  - 880188957
AB  - Previous studies have quantified the extent of usage, knowledge, and relationship of people's behavior in regard to food supplements -- particularly in developed countries such as the United States. Despite the prevalence of supplements use and the issues surrounding its use, there has been little or no study of supplement use in a developing country like the Philippines. This study aimed to explore, qualitatively, the concept, motivations, and expectations of a select group of Filipino elderly relative to their use of commercialized food supplements (CFS). Five faculty extendees from a private university in the Philippines were selected in this phenomenological study. A two-part research instrument consisting of a robotfoto and a face-to-face interview guide with semistructured questions was used. Extended texts were subjected to phenomenological reduction via repertory grid analysis. Conceptual clusters that emerged were subjected to the member checking procedure for purposes of ensuring data trustworthiness. Through constant comparison of the concepts, expectations, and motivations of the respondents of the study relative to their use of CFSs, a clear-cut taxonomy of users was identified: (a) the idealist-experimentalist and (b) the realist-pragmatist. The emerged typologies in this study create a picture that can help healthcare providers understand the dynamics of patient behavior toward CFS use. Implications of the study to health education are also documented in this paper. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - General practitioners' perceptions of the effectiveness of medical interventions: an exploration of underlying constructs
AN  - 902306751; 20158896
AB  - Abstract

              
Background: Many interventions shown to be effective through clinical trials are not readily implemented in clinical practice. Unfortunately, little is known regarding how clinicians construct their perceptions of the effectiveness of medical interventions. This study aims to explore general practitioners' perceptions of the nature of 'effectiveness'.

              
Methods: The design was qualitative in nature using the repertory grid technique to elicit the constructs underlying the perceived effectiveness of a range of medical interventions. Eight medical interventions were used as stimuli (diclophenac to reduce acute pain, cognitive behaviour therapy to treat depression, weight loss surgery to achieve weight loss, diet and exercise to prevent type 2 diabetes, statins to prevent heart disease, stopping smoking to prevent heart disease, nicotine replacement therapy to stop smoking, and stop smoking groups to stop smoking). The setting involved face-to-face interviews followed by questionnaires in London Primary Care Trusts. Participants included a random sample of 13 general practitioners.

              
Results: Analysis of the ratings showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: low patient effort versus high patient effort (dimension one), and small impact versus large impact (dimension two). Dimension one represented constructs such as 'success requires little motivation', 'not a lifestyle intervention', and 'health-care professional led intervention'. Dimension two represented constructs such as 'weak and/or minimal evidence of effectiveness', 'small treatment effect for users', 'a small proportion of users will benefit' and 'not cost-effective'. Constructs within each dimension were closely related.

              
Conclusions: General practitioners judged the effectiveness of medical interventions by considering two broad dimensions: the extent to which interventions involve patient effort, and the size of their impact. The latter is informed by trial evidence, but the patient effort required to achieve effectiveness seems to be based on clinical judgement. Some of the failure of evidence-based medicine to be implemented may be more explicable if both dimensions were attended to.

T1  - Assessment of destination brand associations: An application of Associative Network Theory and network analysis methods
AN  - 755287928
AB  - Recent tourism management research has seen increasing discussions of applying branding concepts into destination marketing. However, brand association and its importance in creating strong and unique brands have not been studied adequately. The purpose of this study was to identify the underlying dimensions that people use to describe destination brands and examine the structural relations of the destination's brand association.    Brand association focuses on analyzing the characteristics consumers' knowledge, perceptions and attitudes associated with a brand and how brand associations interact with each other. Research on brand association provides measurement constructs to evaluate branding effectiveness and offers marketing professionals the strategic information to build strong and unique brand identity.    Through two surveys (n=29) and individual interviews (n=13) using repertory grid method, the study elicited the brand associations of four golf destinations. Applying network analysis methods, the study examined the centralities and cohesion measures of those brand associations. The results identified brand associations that are critical in creating strong brand identities, controlling the activation other brand associations, or complement to each other. The study demonstrated the ability of network analysis in destination brand association research and provided an analytical tool for destination brand management.

T1  - Developing results-based leadership attributes and team cohesiveness through action learning
AN  - 741546553
AB  - Those who develop leaders in manufacturing settings have little data that describe the usefulness of action learning as a method of developing leaders’ abilities to improve results-based leadership attributes or perceptions about their team’s cohesiveness. The two purposes of this study were to evaluate an action learning program with regards to its (a) usefulness in promoting results-based leadership attributes and (b) modification of team cohesiveness perceptions. The conceptual framework is founded upon a nexus of action learning, results-based leadership attributes, and team cohesiveness in the context of leadership development with the entire population of a 12-member team. Action learning utilizes adult learning concepts and combines contingency and transformational leadership theories. The research questions inquire how such a program improves the demonstration of the attributes and modifies personal psychological constructs of team cohesiveness. Archival records, interviews, journals, and repertory grids were used to collect qualitative data for analysis. Analyses were carried out through thematic coding of categorical aggregation and identification of patterns. Findings indicated that leadership team members thought small groups and vicarious learning experiences, developed through open sharing, were found to be useful, but cohesiveness of the group did not improve. The results of this research may provide positive social impact through influencing leaders who affect the lives of employees. Since many organizations use team structures, it is important that the teams be as effective as they can be. If leaders can help teams function more effectively, they will be more productive for the organization and society as a whole.

T1  - An investigation into digital media: Characteristics of learning objects which K–12 teachers determine meet their instructional needs
AN  - 619971451
AB  - In recent years, learning objects have emerged as an instructional tool for teachers. Digital libraries and collections provide teachers with free or fee-base access to a variety of learning objects from photos and famous speeches to Flash animations and interactive Java Applets. Learning objects offer opportunities for students to interact with digital media in ways that can bring concepts and ideas to life. Students can visualize what changes in matter might look like and practice math skills like multiplying decimals. They can even receive instant feedback and interact with tutorials as many times as needed.    The purpose of this mixed methods study is to examine how K-12 teachers determine the characteristics of learning objects that meet their instructional needs. Capturing snapshots of what characteristics of learning objects that successful K-12 teachers select may lead to a clearer picture that could advance the use of learning objects in the classroom. By incorporating learning objects into their instructional practices, teachers can enhance their instruction as well as demonstrate to media savvy students how to use readily available learning objects to express and communicate what they've learned.    In order to identify the characteristics of learning objects that teachers deem useful, a small sample of K-12 teachers experienced in using learning objects were interviewed using the Repertory Grid Technique. This technique is used to elicit personal constructs. In this study, a representative group of learning objects were examined to elicit constructs or characteristics about learning objects with regard to instructional use. The resulting learning object characteristics were analyzed to determine if the characteristics deemed useful by teachers are aligned to the characteristics that learning object designers use.

T1  - Social constructionism and personal constructivism: Getting the business owner's view on the role of sex and gender
AN  - 356965450
AB  - Purpose - While the entrepreneurship and small business research literature has tended to portray women as lesser than men in identifying the differences between them, little research has looked at how gender is construed in business ownership. The purpose of this paper is to provide a new focus, examining how male and female business owners construe each other. Design/methodology/approach - The research employs George Kelly's personal construct theory and repertory grids to examine the constructs associated with male and female business owners. Findings - It is found that there are many constructs used to describe business owners and, counter to predictions from some of the literature review, few differences between the way in which male and female business owners are construed. The paper offers explanations as to why so few differences are found. Research limitations/implications - The sample is limited to just one area of Britain and the businesses had all been established in the last three years. This will influence the generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - This paper is able to offer research evidence to demonstrate that male and female business owners do not construe male and female business owners differently.

T1  - Understanding individual membership at heritage sites
AN  - 225178771
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present George Kelly's The Psychology of Personal Constructs and to discuss how Repertory Grid Technique can aid a better understanding of friends and members in an arts marketing context. The project is a phenomenological study drawing on Kelly's The Psychology of Personal Constructs. The author conducted 16 unstructured face-to-face interviews across the UK during 2007 with individuals who were friends or members of at least five heritage supporter groups as part of a larger mixed methods study. The interviews included the building of Repertory Grids. Analysis of the Repertory Grids gives a detailed understanding of participants' perceptions of, and involvement in, heritage supporter groups. Five themes emerged from the analysis: Organization; Engagement with the Organization; Involvement; Motivation; and Relationships with other members. The paper provides a rich understanding of the portfolio of memberships that individuals have and of how they perceive and interact with them. The paper contributes to the arts marketing literature methodologically by illustrating how to use Repertory Grid Technique in an arts marketing context and by focusing on friends and members, whose perspectives the academic literature does not cover extensively.

T1  - Exploring Identity within the Recovery Process of People with Serious Mental Illnesses
AN  - 204719325
AB  - To examine self-identity within the recovery processes of people with serious mental illnesses using a repertory grid methodology. Cross-sectional study involving 40 mental health service consumers. Participants rated different "self" and "other" elements on the repertory grid against constructs related to recovery, as well as other recovery focused measures. Perceptions of one's "ideal self" represented more advanced recovery in contrast to perceptions of "a person mentally unwell." Current perceptions of self were most similar to perceptions of "usual self" and least similar to "a person who is mentally unwell." Increased identification with one's "ideal self" reflected increased hopefulness in terms of recovery. The recovery repertory grid shows promise in clinical practice, in terms of exploring identity as a key variable within mental health recovery processes. Distance measures of similarity between various self-elements, including perceptions of others, maps logically against the recovery process of hope.

T1  - The Repertory Grid Technique as a Method for the Study of Cultural Differences
AN  - 921473784
AB  - Culture is typically approached in the field of design through generic, cross-domain constructs. In this paper we provide an alternative methodological approach to exploring cross-cultural differences by studying the idiosyncratic views of individuals with regard to existing products. We operationalize this approach through the Repertory Grid Technique, a structured interview technique motivated by Kelly's Personal Construct Theory, and propose a content-analytic procedure combining quantitative and qualitative information. We further propose the use of three distinct metrics in the analysis of personal constructs: dominance, importance, and descriptive richness. Dominance of a construct is measured through the relative percentage of a construct category over the total sample of constructs. Importance is measured through the elicitation order; this assumes that constructs elicited first are more salient and important to the individual. Descriptive richness relates to the diversity of a class of constructs. Some constructs might be uni-dimensional while others might tap to a number of distinct facets. The use of these indices enables the quantification of the different ways in which individuals perceive and differentiate between products. By identifying how individuals respond to a rich set of stimuli within a given domain, we inquire into their values and the qualities they appreciate within this restricted domain. Cultural values are thus explored in relation to a set of stimuli. We tested this procedure through an exploration of the ways 17 Dutch and 16 Japanese industrial designers valued a set of pens.

T1  - Development of a method to investigate medical students’ perceptions of their personal and professional development
AN  - 2259157942
AB  - Personal and Professional Development (PPD) is now key to the undergraduate medical curriculum and requires provision of appropriate learning experiences. In order to achieve this, it is essential that we ascertain students’ perceptions of what is important in their PPD. We required a methodological approach suitable for a large medical school, which defines constructs used by the students to describe their PPD, and is not constrained by a researcher’s predetermined line of questioning. It should also quantify the saliencies of these constructs in the student population and indicate how they gauge their own PPD. The instrument should also be suitable for administration at key stages of the students’ learning experience. Here we describe the first stages in developing a novel method, which fulfils these requirements. It is based on a modified self repertory grid, the “Ideal Self” Inventory. All first year students (N = 379), provided five descriptors of a “good medical student” and of a not very good medical student, which generated 1,531 ‘ideal’ qualities. To define underlying themed constructs, 49 randomly selected descriptors, were grouped together by self selected students (n = 55), using commonly held assumptions. Frequency of item co-occurrence was tabulated by multidimensional scaling. Themed clusters of ‘ideal’ qualities, defined by hierarchical cluster analysis, were overlaid onto the multidimensional scaling to generate a concept map. This revealed seven themed constructs; Personal Welfare, Time and Self Management Committed Work Ethic, Learning Skills, Personal Development/Reflection, Personal and Professional Conduct and Teamwork. We then analysed the 1,531 ‘ideal’ qualities, by determining the frequency with which students used each construct and the proportion of students who used a construct at least once. Personal and Professional Conduct, Committed Work Ethic and Time and Self Management were the most frequently used, implying that they were the most salient for the first year students.

T1  - Using the ratings grid in tourism/event management
AN  - 225183469
AB  - Ratings grids, emerging from personal construct theory, measure an individual's perception of a situation. This paper and exercises seek to demonstrate how researchers and managers can use the grid to evaluate visitors' perceptions of an attraction or event. A training exercise explains how to use the ratings grid, a type of repertory grid, to evaluate tourist attractions or special events. A ratings grid example analyzes visitors' impressions of an art festival (n=142). The steps taken for grid development, administration strategy, and analysis are discussed and described. The results suggest that visitors' impressions of the art festival are consistent with the festival's communication objectives. These findings suggest that the art festival presents itself to visitors accurately. Ratings grids are designed to examine only the elements a researcher selects. Important elements to respondents may be overlooked using this test, and the researcher will not get an accurate measure of respondents' attitudes. The exercise provides guidance to a useful method for measuring visitor perceptions and allows researchers and managers to understand visitor experiences better.

T1  - The quantitative side of the Repertory Grid Technique: some concerns
AN  - 2087791273
AB  - User experience (UX) evaluation is gaining increased interest lately, both from academia and industry. In this paper we argue that UX evaluation needs to fulfill two important requirements: scalability, i.e. the ability to provide useful feedback in different stages of the design, and diversity, i.e. the ability to reflect the di-versity of opinions that may exist in different users. We promote the use of the Repertory Grid Technique as a promising UX evaluation technique and discuss some of our concerns regarding the quantitative side of its use.

T1  - Corporate Governance in the Debate on CSR and Ethics: Sensemaking of Social Issues in Management by Authorities and CEOs
AN  - 194911605
AB  - The goal of this exploratory cognitive study is to uncover how opinion leaders - CEOs and other authorities in the domain of social issues in management - understand and differentiate the various concepts pertaining to corporate governance, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and business ethics. This study extends the analysis to the whole spectrum of social issues in management. For this research 41 Repertory Grid Technique (RGT)  interviews were conducted in Belgium with top experts and CEOs of the Belgian economy and civil society. Both authorities and CEOs pragmatically and rather clearly differentiate the various concepts related to corporate governance, CSR, and business ethics. While CSR is seen as the best candidate for an umbrella term, no unified paradigm has yet to be achieved in the business and social field. Three basic concepts of corporate responsibility, corporate governance, and business ethics emerge as being complementary. Corporate governance has acquired an important place in the hierarchy of business and society concepts. Corporations cannot restrict their actions and communication regarding social issues in management to one single domain. Several complementary issues have to be addressed simultaneously.

T1  - A STUDY OF WEB-DESIGNERS' CRITERIA FOR EFFECTIVE BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER (B2C) WEBSITES USING THE REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE
AN  - 236641480
AB  - Organizations are increasingly using websites not only to capture but also to build relationships with their desired markets. A clear understanding of how best to design effective B2C websites (for both e-commerce and e-service) is therefore vital. Despite its importance, research into the effectiveness of B2C websites remains highly fragmented and user-centric, ignoring the views of web-designers. This study therefore aims to investigate what web-designers consider as attributes of "effective" B2C websites. The relationships amongst attributes are also explored. Twenty web-designers were interviewed using the Repertory Grid Technique in order to elicit factors that they consider important when designing or developing B2C websites. Using a data reduction approach, the elicited attributes were then classified into 14 meta-categories. These meta-categories were compared to prior research. We found that although several meta-categories have been extensively covered in the literature, little attention have been paid to some meta-categories including 'Establishing Website Identity'; 'Categorization of Information'; 'Presentation of Information'; 'Advertisements, Pop-Ups and Animation"; and "Headlines". The inductive approach also permitted the elicitation of the relationships among these meta-categories, giving us a richer understanding of how different website characteristics influence each other. Implications and future research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - CONCEPT-GUIDED QUERY EXPANSION FOR KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT WITH SEMI-AUTOMATIC KNOWLEDGE CAPTURING
AN  - 232583115
AB  - In the knowledge economic era, enterprises have realized the importance of knowledge assets and endeavored to think how to improve their competitive abilities by managing and using knowledge assets effectively in the fast-changing environment. The usability of knowledge is limited due to its difficult access, sharing and visualization; however knowledge management systems (KMS) have proven to be efficient and effective in organizing knowledge of high complexity and in large amounts. Despite, the issue of how to effectively retrieve the desired knowledge from vast knowledge bases still remains due to the difficulty to express conceptual ideas with appropriate queries. To tackle this critical matter, we propose a new KMS solution powered by a concept-guided query expansion scheme. In addition, repertory grid analysis is conducted to semi-automatically elicit and model the structure of domain experts' tacit knowledge and build up a hierarchical concept structure. With this mechanism, availability of tacit knowledge is increased and its access and navigation facilitated, allowing users to acquire the desired knowledge and contribute to knowledge dissemination.

AB  - Research on Web site usability using the Microsoft Usability Guidelines (MUG) have (1) assumed the MUG categories and subcategories as a given and (2) focused on the relationships between these attributes and site usability, thereby largely ignoring their underlying meaning. Using the Repertory Grid Technique, the present research elicits the attributes that Web users consider important when using business-to-consumer (B2C) Web sites. The results support the MUG framework but identify three additional attributes that warrant being MUG subcategories: quality of Web site content, Web site appearance, and extent to which the site provides convenient services to facilitate on-line activities. An enhanced MUG is presented. The implications for research and practice are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cognitive segmentation: Modeling the structure and content of customers' thoughts
AN  - 227752011
AB  - This paper proposes a cognitive segmentation technique that models both customers' cognitive content and structure. Cognitive segmentation provides a quantitative operationalization of idiographic cognitions that can be compared and integrated across customers to move beyond the in-depth understanding and wide generalizing trade-off. In addition, cognitive segmentation utilizes participants' own semantics for eliciting and aggregating cognitions. This method allows researchers to understand content in light of structure, as participants' elicited cognitive contents are further interpreted as a function of the complexity of their cognitive structures. The conceptual foundations from personal construct theory as well as a description of the nine-step implementation process whereby participants fill out a modified version of Kelly's Repertory Grid and complete Borman's trait implication procedure are provided. An application illustrates how cognitive segmentation can identify and assess the size potential of each customer target as a function of their cognitive content and structure. A discussion of the results and directions for further research are also provided. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 207290454
AB  - "This study describes four case studies of upper limb and lower limb high tech and conventional prosthetic users. Participants were interviewed using the repertory grid technique (RGT), a qualitative technique to explore individual values and preferences regarding specific choices and events. The participants generated distinctive patterns of personal constructs and ratings regarding prosthetic use and different prosthetic options available. The RGT produced a unique profile of preferences regarding prosthetic technologies for each participant. User choice is an important factor when matching prosthetic technology to the user. The consumer's values regarding different prosthetic options are likely to be a critical factor in prosthetic acceptance and ultimate quality of life," wrote E. Schaffalitzky and colleagues, Dublin City University.

T1  - An investigation into sustainable product conceptualization using a design knowledge hierarchy and Hopfield network
AN  - 213749538
AB  - In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift on providing design services from manufacturing/marketing to sustainability. Although a number of studies have been conducted on sustainable issues in many aspects, impacts such as multidisciplinary integration and product life-cycle consideration have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate into the integration of functional, marketing, and commercial perspectives with product sustainability in the early stage of product conceptualization. In this study, a sustainable product conceptualization system (SPCS) is proposed. The product platform of a specific product is first generated by designers or domain experts using general sorting, a requirement acquisition technique, and design knowledge hierarchy (DKH), a knowledge representation structure. Based on the product platform, initial design options can be obtained using morphological configuration, i.e., combining different part options. Subsequently, the Hopfield network is used to narrow down initial design space based on initial design criteria solicited by domain experts. To select the preferred design options for the purpose of sustainable product conceptualization, the sustainability-cost pairs can be obtained based on the rated sustainability and cost criteria solicited using repertory grids by domain experts. Consequently, the results are discussed on the coordination between product sustainability degree and cost efficiency. A case study on cellular-phone design is conducted for system illustration.

T1  - IT project managers' construction of successful project management practice: a repertory grid investigation
AN  - 198289209
AB  - Although effective project management is critical to the success of information technology (IT) projects, little empirical research has investigated skill requirements for IT project managers (PMs). This study addressed this gap by asking 19 practicing IT PMs to describe the skills that successful IT PMs exhibit. A semi-structured interview method known as the repertory grid (RepGrid) technique was used to elicit these skills. Nine skill categories emerged: client management, communication, general management, leadership, personal integrity, planning and control, problem solving, systems development and team development. Our study complements existing research by providing a richer understanding of several skills that were narrowly defined (client management, planning and control, and problem solving) and by introducing two new skill categories that had not been previously discussed (personal integrity and team development). Analysis of the individual RepGrids revealed four distinct ways in which study participants combined skill categories to form archetypes of effective IT PMs. We describe these four IT PM archetypes - General Manager, Problem Solver, Client Representative and Balanced Manager - and discuss how this knowledge can be useful for practitioners, researchers and educators. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.

T1  - The repertory grid technique: Its place in empirical software engineering research
AN  - 196418765
AB  - Personal construct theory (applied via the repertory grid technique) supports interpretivist research in a structured manner and, as such, has relevance for researchers conducting studies focused on the human and organisational aspects of software engineering. Personal construct theory (which underpins the repertory grid technique) is introduced, and the technique and its administration is discussed. Research studies from the literature are reviewed to provide illustrative examples of its application within a software engineering context. Since any research approach needs to answer questions about its reliability and validity within a particular study, these issues are considered for repertory grid investigations and criteria are offered that can be used to judge these issues within a planned, and/or reported, study.

T1  - The use of the repertory grid technique to examine staff beliefs about clients with dual diagnosis
AN  - 213888836
AB  - This paper reports a study exploring how individual psychiatric staff construes clients with psychosis who misuse substances. A dual diagnosis of substance misuse is common in clients with psychosis. Previous studies have suggested that psychiatric staff feel ill-equipped to work with these clients, and hold negative views of them, affecting client care and recovery. Understanding staff attitudes can inform training and practice. Twelve psychiatric nursing staff working in an inpatient service for adults with enduring mental health difficulties in England were interviewed. Using a repertory grid technique, staff were asked to describe clients and acquaintances who did and did not misuse substances, themselves and colleagues. All staff made critical judgements of some clients, particularly clients with dual diagnosis, but were less judgemental towards acquaintances who misused substances. Staff who used fewer dimensions to construe people appeared to make a clear distinction between clients and non-clients. This distinction was not apparent for staff with more cognitively complex construct systems. Specific factors that could be implicated in the organization of individuals' construct systems included personal experience of services as a carer; these staff made less distinction between clients and non-clients. Further training is needed for staff working with clients with a dual diagnosis. Training packages need to consider the personal experiences and views of staff. Reducing the boundaries between staff and clients might enable staff to better understand the actions of clients and improve client care.

T1  - The repertory grid to unfold conflicting positions: The case of a stakeholder dialogue on prospects for hydrogen
AN  - 205255116
AB  - In this article, the authors share their experience with the application of the repertory grid method, and they demonstrate that this is an appropriate method to scrutinize complex issues and to structure stakeholder dialogues on these issues. Repertory grid is used to articulate stakeholders' conceptions of the prospects for hydrogen (H2). The aim was to highlight not only the mainstream notions of hydrogen but also conceptions that gain less prominence in the hydrogen discourse. Repertory grid was applied in a computerized fashion, with twenty-four stakeholders. The data were analyzed by means of a frequency analysis and a HOMALS analysis. The analyses demonstrate that repertory grid has been an appropriate method to structure the hydrogen dialogue in three ways: 1. it elicited the full range of concepts that stakeholders used to evaluate hydrogen options, 2. it identified the most salient hydrogen visions to be explored further in the dialogue, and 3. it helped to form dialogue groups according to these visions.

T1  - Development of a team measure for tacit knowledge in software development teams
AN  - 229558256
AB  - In this paper we operationally define and measure tacit knowledge at the team-level in the software development domain. Through a series of three empirical studies we developed and validated the team tacit knowledge measure (TTKM) for software developers. In the first study, initial scale items were developed using the repertory grid technique and content analysis. In Study 2, supplied repertory grids were administered to novices and experts to establish differential items, and Study 3 validated the TTKM on a sample of 48 industrial software development teams. In developing the TTKM we explored the relationships between tacit knowledge, explicit job knowledge and social interaction and their effect on team performance as measured by efficiency and effectiveness. In addition we assess the implications for managing software development teams and increasing team performance through social interaction. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Women withdrawers in engineering studies: Identity formation and learning culture as gendered barriers for persistence?
AN  - 199543085
AB  - Scholarship on women in engineering education mainly focuses on the question of how to attract more women to this subject. The topic concerning women in engineering education is here guided by the question of why women leave engineering studies. The paper aims to examine the main conflicts women encounter in engineering education and to derive implications for interventions suited for strengthening institutional bonding forces. The question is approached through case analyses of 40 interviews with women and men (as the control group) who have left their studies. In addition, repertory grids were carried out with all interviewees and analysed. On the basis of these analyses, five types of dropout could be defined. Two case studies with women are presented in detail in this article. These cases are especially representative of two types of dropout that are characterised by high quotas of women. The central conflicts of women in engineering education are often either suffering from poor grades or that women being afflicted by a subjective feeling of not gaining a deep understanding of technical phenomena. These two conflicts represent the two pillars of identity formation in engineering education that are necessary to bind students to their studies: passing the exams with good grades and feeling self-efficacious in the handling of technology. Up-to-date subject-specific studies on dropout in engineering education - especially with a focus on women - are marginal in Europe, and particularly so in Germany.

T1  - Reconsideration of the Bank Credit Assessment Decision: Theoretical and Practical Issues
AN  - 1697566917
AB  - "The purpose of this paper is to discuss conceptual issues related to the bank credit assessment decision in the context of current events in the financial markets. To add to the theoretical discussion, a case study of a large Swedish bank will be conducted and data will be captured and then analyzed with the repertory grid technique. Additionally, information will be collected through interviews with about 60 bank managers or bank loan officers to allow statistical analyses. Similarities and differences between groups of bank loan officers (e.g. senior experts and novices) are important to identify in the context of current events. To add validity to this study, a ìco-researchî approach will be used by involving the bank managers and bank loan officers in analyzing and interpreting the results. Attempts will be made to identify any differences in the decision approaches of bank managers and bank loan officers pre- and post- the current financial crisis. The credit assessment decision processes will be examined by focusing on the initial encounter between the applicant and the bank loan officer who generates the first screening of the application. Information will be gathered regarding the identity of information used by the suppliers of credit in order to evaluate loan applications for approval or rejection and how this information can be categorized to enhance comparability between application cases, borrowers and personal attributes for bank loan officers. Theoretically the research rests upon financial theory, institutional theory, structuration, sense-making, accountability and cognitive theory. The conference paper outlines the methods to be used, discusses advantages and limitations with respect to validity and reliability of the methods, and tests the repertory grid technique on one respondent in a pre-study. It is concluded that the planned approach is feasible.""

T1  - Measuring psychological change in offenders with intellectual disabilities and alcohol misuse using repertory grids: two case examples
AN  - 213054293
AB  - Measuring psychological change in offenders with intellectual disabilities undergoing psychological therapy presents the clinician with a variety of challenges. They include finding measures sensitive enough to measure the often modest cognitive changes that take place over the course of psychological therapy and finding measures appropriate to use with this client group. Little is known about the use of alcohol in offenders with intellectual disabilities. Repertory grids, based on Kelly's (1955) theory of personality, have been shown to be an adaptable, sensitive, reliable and valid measure of psychological change. Two case examples are used to show how repertory grids can be used to assess the treatment gains made by patients undergoing different (though similar) psychological interventions aimed at reducing alcohol misuse.

T1  - Understanding Consumer Attitudes Toward Food Technologies in Canada
AN  - 207677066
AB  - This article reports a study on consumer attitudes to 21 food and nonfood technologies in Canada. The study involves repertory grid interviews with 36 food consumers, the data from which are analyzed using generalized Procrustes analysis. Results highlight the role of perceived risk and perceived benefit in determining the acceptability of the technologies, with individual technologies lying along a continuum between the two. For technology as a whole and the 21 specific technologies, the perceived risk and perceived benefit constructs were the dominant determinants of consumer acceptability. While perceptions of perceived risk and perceived benefit differed between individual respondents, there were very limited consistent relations with a range of sociodemographic variables.

T1  - CONFLICT AND CO-PARENTING: THE CONSTRUCTS OF NONRESIDENT FATHERS
AN  - 233129897
AB  - Scots law constructs a co-parental role for nonresident fathers without clarifying how this should operate in practice. Personal Construct Theory (PCT) offers a useful approach to understanding such fathers' distinct and changing conceptions of their role. Findings are presented from a study of 17 nonresident Scottish fathers maintaining contact with nonresident children. Idiographic analysis of data from repertory grid interviews administered three times over the course of a year shows that participants perceive family situations in terms of paternal involvement, impact, emotion, or antagonism. Changes in construing following family events support the PCT understanding of hostility; implications for family services are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Barriers to networking for women in a UK professional service
AN  - 213195797
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of personal contact networks in the UK public relations sector, focusing on the barriers to networking identified by practitioners. Empirical research using qualitative methodologies of in-depth interviews and repertory grids conducted with directors, managers and executives in seven UK public relations agencies. UK public relations practitioners in the study may face up to 17 barriers to networking drivers and actions. Three types of barriers emerged-psychological, situational and social. Female practitioners identified all 17 barriers to networking, whereas men identified seven. Research limitations/implications - An insight into the differences in men and women's networking experiences in a growing professional service, especially those negatively influencing their activities. Gender differences are identified and the apparent exclusion from power networks, especially of younger females. UK public relations practitioners may be hindered in the key managerial area of networking, with women perceiving themselves to face more barriers than men. This poses challenges for practitioners to overcome such obstacles, especially for women in this female-dominated industry. Consultancies must consider remedial strategies to counter barriers their employees face, or potentially limit their access to resources and influence which personal networks can bring. The paper is one of the first studies into personal contact networks in the UK public relations industry. It reveals the extent to which both men and women in this professional service face barriers to networking. The paper identifies that women in particular may experience more than twice as many barriers as male counterparts and suggests younger women may be being placed at a disadvantage.

T1  - Older people's perceptions towards conventional and functional yoghurts through the repertory grid method: A cross-country study
AN  - 225133786
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate older people's perceptions, across eight European countries (the UK, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Italy), towards functional foods. The repertory grid method was used to elicit reasons underlying preferences of five yoghurts with different functional properties and two conventional ones. Familiarity was the key driver in products' separation. For the Italian case, as well as the Spanish, Portuguese, Danish and Swedish the first principal axis could be interpreted as novel-common axis, whilst it was not in the UK, Germany and Poland. Behavioural intention to buy functional yoghurts was more strongly predicted and moderated by single item perceived need (PN) than single item affective and/or cognitive attitude (AA, CA), even though PN, AA and CA could be consistently assessed within the same latent measure (in all countries but Denmark). Nevertheless, beliefs/attitudes towards a novel category of products such as functional foods may be reasonably keeping moving. In this study, preference instructions pertaining to beneficial and imagery attributes, revealed idiosyncratic properties associated with functional yoghurts across eight European samples of older people.

T1  - A supply-chain-oriented business process reengineering strategy for on-demand new product development
AN  - 219176441
AB  - Various strategies of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) have been developed to improve companies' entire business process. From a more systematic viewpoint, these systems should be further organised under a unified value-added process, which covers all activities of a supply chain. Based on this understanding, a so-called business process reengineering system (BPRS) was proposed and developed. The BPRS consists of three modules, viz. product conceptualisation module using general sorting and repertory grids, supply chain formation module using the Hopfield neural network, and BPR decision-making module using a location-capacity-based strategy. A case study on cellular phone design was used for system validation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Investigating project managers' work values by repertory grids interviews
AN  - 216306518
AB  - The purpose of the research is to investigate project managers' work values and their relationship with project managers' competence. In this research, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews using repertory grid techniques on 18 Chinese project managers. Three different approaches are utilised to analyse data obtained from the interviews. The authors categorised work values with different perspectives. Project managers' core work values are identified. The authors recommend that work values are an important dimension in relation to project manager's competence. The understanding of a project manager's work values has a potential application in human resources development and competence-based management development. This paper presents an innovative approach to the investigation of a project manager's competence.

T1  - Construction of Self and Others in Unipolar Depressive Disorders: A Study Using Repertory Grid Technique
AN  - 216255606
AB  - This study used Kelly's (1955/1991) Role Construct Repertory Grid (RepGrid) technique to assess cognitive features underlying depressive states. RepGrids from patients with depressive disorders (n = 105, including Major Depression, Dysthymia, and Adjustment Disorder with depressed or mixed symptoms) were compared with a non-clinical group (n = 305). The RepGrids of participants were analyzed using the computer program GRIDCOR (Feixas & Cornejo, 2002). Consistent with hypotheses, those with depressive disorders perceived themselves and others more negatively, perceived themselves as different from others, and generated fewer constructs to describe self and others in comparison to the non-clinical group. There were no differences in use of extreme ratings or in unidimensional construing (percent variance accounted for by the first factor in correspondence analysis) on the RepGrid. RepGrid techniques offer the potential to better understand the processes of construction of the self and others in persons with depressive disorders. Specific RepGrid profiles associated with depression-negativity, resentment, and isolation-may be helpful in further individuating treatment for depression. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Relational schemas as sources of evaluation and misevaluation of leader-member exchanges: Some initial evidence
AN  - 200775188
AB  - We investigated whether dyad members' relational schemas, a cognitive representation of exchange experiences, would affect how leaders and members evaluate and misevaluate the quality of their exchange relationships. Based on data derived from repertory grid technique and two waves of survey data, we found that leaders and members tended to form different relational schemas of their partners. While leaders developed LMX schemas focusing on work-related issues, members' schemas focused more on interpersonal concerns. These findings confirmed that the different schemas employed by each party affect how they stored, retrieved and (mis)evaluated their LMX experiences with each other. Implications for theory and practice, limitations of this study, and future research directions are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - CRM Change Management in an Emerging Country Context: An Exploratory Study in India
AN  - 201692118
AB  - All over the world, change management has found to be very crucial for CRM success. However, the CRM change management does not work the same way across different contexts. Few studies in developed countries assume that a set of prescriptive CRM change management activities works well in any 'given' context. These studies ignore the interplay of organizational actions and the broader context. Drawing on the institutional theory, this study explores this interplay; based on the repertory grid data collected from Indian organizations, it finds how structural and cultural context of an emerging country affects CRM change management activities.

T1  - Older people and convenience in meal preparation: a European study on understanding their perception towards vegetable soup preparation
AN  - 210896321
AB  - A sample of 768 seniors over 65 years, living in eight European countries, was interviewed to investigate perceptions, preferences and attitudes towards convenience in preparation of vegetable soups. In each country, a range of seven vegetables soups varying in preparation levels required before consumption was identified. The first part of the interview (in-depth interview) was carried out by using the Repertory Grid Method, an effective method to describe perceptions of foods using consumers' own language. Overall, vegetable-related foods with convenience in preparation were perceived in similar ways across the countries. Older adults tended to describe ready vegetable soups mainly making associations related to preparation, rather than on their own preferences and evaluations. Conversely, fresh vegetables requiring all preparation or considerable preparation (cut fresh vegetables) were mainly associated with attributes such as taste, freshness, health benefits  and familiarity with the product . The second session of the interview was based in part on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. A component measuring the extent to which it is felt necessary to eat convenience foods (perceived need) was assessed as well. Generally speaking, older people did not seem to view positively the consumption of convenience foods. Additionally, they did not feel the need to consume these products nor do they have the intention to consume them in the forthcoming month. Pleasure associated with performance of the behaviour was the most important determinant of intention to eat convenience foods in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. Perceived need was the most important factor in determining the intention to eat convenience foods in the UK, Poland and Portugal. Perceived control and subjective norms were the most important factors influencing the intention to eat convenience foods in Italy. The encouragement of consuming ready-meals might represent an opportunity to have healthier food choices and to reduce the risk a monotonous diet for older people who cannot or do not know how to cook, combined with a low interest in food-related activities such as cooking.

T1  - Attributes of identity document credibility: A synthesis of expert knowledge
AN  - 304800848
AB  - In broad terms — including a thief's use of existing credit card, bank, or other accounts — the number of identity fraud victims in the United States ranges 9-10 million per year, or roughly 4% of the US adult population. The average annual theft per stolen identity was estimated at $6,383 in 2006, up approximately 22% from $5,248 in 2003; an increase in estimated total theft from $53.2 billion in 2003 to $56.6 billion in 2006. About three million Americans each year fall victim to the worst kind of identity fraud: new account fraud. Names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and other data are acquired fraudulently from the issuing organization, or from the victim then these data are used to create fraudulent identity documents. In turn, these are presented to other organizations as evidence of identity, used to open new lines of credit, secure loans, “flip” property, or otherwise turn a profit in a victim's name. This is much more time consuming — and typically more costly — to repair than fraudulent use of existing accounts.    This research borrows from well-established theoretical backgrounds, in an effort to answer the question – what is it that makes identity documents credible? Most importantly, identification of the components of credibility draws upon personal construct psychology, the underpinning for the repertory grid technique, a form of structured interviewing that arrives at a description of the interviewee’s constructs on a given topic, such as credibility of identity documents. This represents substantial contribution to theory, being the first research to use the repertory grid technique to elicit from experts, their mental constructs used to evaluate credibility of different types of identity documents reviewed in the course of opening new accounts. The research identified twenty-one characteristics, different ones of which are present on different types of identity documents. Expert evaluations of these documents in different scenarios suggest that visual characteristics are most important for a physical document, while authenticated personal data are most important for a digital document.

T1  - Self, group, and society: Emergence of new political identities in the Republic of Macedonia
AN  - 304496604
AB  - The Republic of Macedonia provides an illustration of how a society's identities reciprocally affect government and politics. This research investigates the extent to which Macedonia is developing a stable and cohesive society and contrasts more traditional investigations that treat identity as coextensive with fixed ethnic boundaries. This study employs an inductive approach to identity formation by investigating how individual beliefs and values function within a society. To accomplish this, a method for discerning and characterizing identity groups was employed, generating a rich mixture of qualitative and quantitative data.    Fieldwork took place in two stages in 2005-2006. In stage one, university students across Macedonia (n=109) were interviewed using an adaptation of George Kelly's repertory grid technique, a semi-structured interview procedure. In stage two, a national follow-up survey (n=496) based on those findings was administered to a random sample of Macedonia's general population, allowing for an evaluation of initial results. Multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, generalized procrustes analysis, and a measure of cognitive homophily were employed to identify and assess similarities and differences among identity groups. This multitier approach made it possible to discern unifying themes that contribute to the previously unrecognized growth in civic identity that is beginning to span ethnic divisions in Macedonia. Although ethnic designations remain important to the assessment of identity, research findings support the contention that emergent identities in this new state are not categorically deterministic. This implies that some members of society are developing identities more strongly associated with Macedonia's viability as a state than with ethnic and other designations.    The methodology employed in this study offers an emic perspective that permits inductively derived comparisons, rather than etic comparisons that limit investigations to easily identifiable fixed categories. The emit methodology, operationalized through the repertory grid technique and Kelly's theory of constructivist alternativism, elicits culturally relevant frames of reference in a manner that preserves the meanings attached by members of society while minimizing the effects of the researcher's own cultural and intellectual biases. This is a promising methodology for investigating potentially emergent identities in other regions and communities where cultural misconceptions pose potential barriers to societal stability.

T1  - Middle grades in-service teachers pedagogical content knowledge of student internal representation of equivalent fractions and algebraic expressions
AN  - 288023486
AB  - This study examined teacher pedagogical content knowledge changes through a Middle School Mathematics Program professional development workshop, development of noticing use of student representations, and teacher changes in hypothetical learning trajectories due to noticed aspects of student representation corresponding to the hypothetical learning trajectory model.    Using constant comparatives and repertory grid analysis, data was collected in two phases. Phase one, the teacher pre-test, occurred at the beginning of the summer of the 2003 professional development workshop. Phase two, the teacher post-test, occurred at the end of the workshop. Twenty-four teachers supplied data on pre- and post-tests during phases one and two. Eleven teachers were from Texas and 13 from Delaware. Six Texas and eight Delaware teachers worked with the algebraic expression concepts. Five Texas and five Delaware teachers worked with the equivalent fraction concepts. Four mathematics education researchers from Texas, three from Delaware, and two from the American Association for the Advancement of Science participated in facilitating the professional development.    The results show that teacher pedagogical content knowledge changes with the help of a professional development partnership. The differences in knowledge can be measured with a hierarchal cluster analysis of the repertory grid by analyzing relationships between constructs and elements. Teacher hypothetical learning trajectories change depending on student representations of what they do and do not know about concepts.    The study encourages teachers to use knowledge of students’ representation about a concept to determine what to teach next and how the concept should be taught. Teachers should use different types of representations including formal, imagistic, and action representations in teaching mathematical ideas. This will promote student development in all process standards including reasoning and proof, communication, problem solving, and connection.    The findings suggest that teacher pedagogical content knowledge can be redefined during professional development partnerships. Furthermore, teachers’ knowledge of representation is varied and emphasis on the imagistic representation should be explored further. Finally, professional development models that facilitate how to extract what a student does and does not know based on representation, can be the basis for defining hypothetical learning trajectories.

T1  - Understanding the persona of clinical instructors: The use of students' doodles in nursing research
AN  - 200171553
AB  - While it is true that understanding the attributes and unique distinction of the nursing faculty has been the subject of most of the studies, little is known about how the use of doodles can help surface the persona of the clinical instructors. This study aims to capture the essence or the lebenswelt of the concept of "clinical instructor" from the lens of students' doodles which have been considered as a powerful qualitative tool in articulating individual experiences. A total of 195 senior nursing students recruited from a comprehensive university in the Philippines were the subjects in this qualitative study. Data were gathered from self-generated illustrations and written explanations made by the subjects to identify their concept of effective and ineffective clinical instructors. Phenomenological reduction was observed through a repertory grid, where doodles drawn were listed, categorized and thematised to reveal the qualities of the clinical instructor. The subjective nature of the findings, though not generalizable, has surfaced how doodling can be a potent tool in identifying collective interpretation of the essence of health professions construct such as the one under study. The doodles revealed that an effective clinical instructor (enlightening, engaging and embracing) is one who is able to facilitate the learning of the students as well as being able to establish a harmonious learning atmosphere for and with the students. On the other hand, an ineffective clinical instructor (detrimental, dangling, and disturbing) impedes students' development in the clinical practice by causing conflict through their personal attitudes and their teaching strategies. This can have benefits for clinical instructors, to improve themselves and realize the impact of their attributes to the clinical learning of students.

T1  - Through the Eyes of Experts: A Socio-cognitive Perspective on the Automation of Fingerprint Work
AN  - 218135810
AB  - Prior research on technological frames indicates that many of the difficulties associated with systems implementation stem from differences in the meanings users, managers, and system developers attribute to automation projects. Although the concept of technological frames has been used to explore the bases for intergroup conflict during implementation, it is also a useful device for probing more deeply into the effects complex systems have on users' perceptions of their work and the role-altering effects of new technologies. Drawing upon personal construct theory and job characteristics theory, we adapted the  repertory grid technique to explore the technology-in- use frames of a group of occupationally certified fingerprint technicians (FPTs). Our investigation reveals the important role the FPTs' occupationally  defined values and norms played in structuring their existing work practices and the tensions produced by organizationally mandated efforts to restructure the logic of their expertise-based hierarchies. These insights illuminate the effects work redesign had on the FPTs' task environment, the process logic that guided specific work practices, and the roles defined by their expertise-based hierarchies, and provide a basis for understanding the FPTs' unanticipated reactions to it.

However, to date, there has been little systematic investigation that examines aspects associated with competitive benchmarking and the impact and effect that this has on strategy development. Thus despite the level of knowledge that has been accumulated over the years regarding the dynamics of competitive landscapes, our understanding of the impact and effect of this particular matter on decision making is limited. More importantly, studies that have addressed the topic are either theoretical alone in contents or have only used secondary data. Equally, these studies have approached the subject mostly from an impersonal mathematical perspective and practitioners' views on the issue have been overlooked. This paper aims to address these weaknesses in the literature. In doing so, it seeks to place attention on the individual, which has been overlooked by previous examinations.   Design/methodology/approach- The research is cross-sectional and it is based on primary methodology, having employed qualitative techniques for analysis. It involves face-to-face semi-structured interviews combined with the repertory grid technique. The industry investigated is the UK mainstream leisure foreign package holidays. The sample size is near to the sampling frame of the research and the investigation took place between March and August 2003. Findings - It was found that managers of firms from the same strategic group consider their group as a reference point in their decision-making process and as a result of their benchmarking observations they adjust their firms' competitive strategies to reflect their group's strategic behaviour. It was also found that firms of the same strategic group are more likely to respond to market conditions and events in a similar manner. Originality/value - This paper examined issues associated with benchmarking, in the context of strategic groups, having employed primary qualitative research strategies in order to add "fresh" data on a topic that so far has merely been investigated quantitatively through secondary sources alone. As such, it has initiated a much needed contents dimension on the topic to complement the activity and process-oriented only studies in the area. The research not only tested earlier propositions in order to accumulate more evidence in the field and enable better generalisations on the subject but it has also expanded current theories in the area.

AB  - The explorative study sums up the preliminary findings concerning the research in basic dimensions by means of which it is possible to describe some ways of thinking used by individuals in politicians impression formation. As a research method, one modification of repertory grid technique (REP-test) was used. The findings show the importance of populism dimension and political-ideological dimensions for the complex politician impression, the relation of politicians' sincerity perception and populism, and the linkage of politicians' visibility perception and leadership abilities. The conclusions are taken as preliminary and they are recommended to further verification. The reflection of authors' experience with application of repertory grid technique in the field of politicians impression formation research is a part of discussion. This technique appears to be useful and utilizable in this field. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - SOMATIZATION DISORDER AND COGNITIVE CONFLICTS: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY WITH A CLINICAL SAMPLE / SOMATIZACIÓN Y CONFLICTOS COGNITIVOS: ESTUDIO EXPLORATORIO CON UNA MUESTRA CLÍNICA
AN  - 2231332963
AB  - Somatization problems generate high healthcare costs, and some of its usual treatments prove ineffective and even counterproductive. An interdisciplinary treatment approach seems necessary in order to provide an integrated treatment for these patients. From this perspective, hardly-studied cognitive processes such as the subjective construction of self, symptoms, and other people should be taken into account. That is why it may be important to study cognitive conflicts, which could stand as subjective barriers for healing. The goal of the study is to investigate the relationships between implicative dilemmas, a kind of cognitive conflict that can be detected using the Repertory Grid, and a somatization scale. Results suggest that somatization scores are higher for individuals with implicative dilemmas, and that the presence of such conflicts predicts somatization better than gender, age, self-esteem, or cognitive differentiation.
Los problemas de somatización generan un elevado consumo de recursos y algunos tratamientos habituales resultan ineficaces o contraproducentes. Parece necesario un abordaje multidisciplinar que ofrezca un tratamiento integral a estos pacientes. Esta perspectiva debería tener en cuenta factores cognitivos poco estudiados como la construcción subjetiva del sí mismo, los síntomas y los demás. De ahí el interés de estudiar los conflictos cognitivos, que podrían erigirse en barreras subjetivas para la curación. El objetivo de este estudio es investigar las relaciones entre los dilemas implicativos, un tipo de conflicto cognitivo que puede detectarse con la Técnica de Rejilla, y una escala de somatización. Los resultados sugieren que las puntuaciones en somatización son más elevadas en personas con dilemas implicativos, y la presencia de estos conflictos predice mejor la somatización que el sexo, la edad, la autoestima o la diferenciación cognitiva.

T1  - Facilitating Management Learning: Developing Critical Reflection Through Reflective Tools
AN  - 209904417
AB  - The aim of this article is to explore how the practice of critical reflection within a management learning process can be facilitated through the application of reflective processes and tools. A distinction is drawn between reflection as a form of individual development (of, say, the reflective practitioner) and critical reflection as a route to collective action and a component of organizational learning and change. Critical reflection, however, is not a process that comes naturally to many managers and may have to be learned or facilitated, either in formal classroom contexts, or through learning processes such as coaching, mentoring and action learning. The article discusses some of the tools available to learning facilitators, in helping a group or client towards a more critically reflective understanding of their situation and organization. These include processes such as storytelling, and reflective and reflexive conversations, and the use of tools such as reflective metaphors, critical incident analysis, reflective journals, repertory grids and concept mapping. Such tools provide an aid to critical reflection, which is seen as one process that mediates between experience, knowledge and action. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Competent Production Supervisors
AN  - 222399199
AB  - While the manufacturing sector is vanishing in most European and North American regions, northeast Italian firms have successfully contrasted global competition thanks to superior manufacturing capabilities grounded, among other things, on people's competencies. Applying nonparametric statistical analysis on data from 212 behavioral event and 44 repertory grid interviews, the research presented in this note investigates the nature of these competencies for production supervisors in northeast Italian firms. We identify four threshold and nine distinctive competencies and offer insights on the relationship between these competencies and northeast Italian firms' manufacturing capability. We also suggest how to use competency tools to design skill development policies in industrial clusters and implement effective human resource management practices in small and medium-sized enterprises.

T1  - Job-matching and employee diversity: an exploratory study
AN  - 219241561
AB  - Purpose - The investigation reported here aims to: adapt existing recruitment theory to add to tools available to small business recruiters for job matching; provide job-specific scoring methods to help employers in recruitment processes; and enhance the consideration of reasonable adjustment issues in the possible employment of disabled individuals. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 32 interviews were conducted on-site with managers to devise and test templates combining person specifications with job characteristics, based on managers' judgements of what is important. The methods devised and used are an original adaptation of repertory grid principles. Where there were disabled employees, indications of the employees' success and difficulty were elicited. Findings - A simplified derivative of repertory grid method to give a combined abilities/tasks matrix was found usable and clarifying by respondents. Research limitations/implications - The investigation was confined to hotel and leisure small to medium-sized enterprises in Sussex, UK. As they stand, the methods could be used in business sectors beyond the sector to which the research reported in this paper has been confined, but further work is needed on resource consequences, and on the implications for state benefits and related support in the case of disabled applicants. Originality/value - Results of the analysis could be used almost immediately by a company: for future applicants, the company could make direct use of the completed matrix by scoring the applicant on the matrix variables, superimposing the applicant matrix on the requirements matrix, and calculating the percentage of desirable scores met.

T1  - Attracting Generation Y graduates: Organisational attributes, likelihood to apply and sex differences
AN  - 219353569
AB  - Building on person-organisation fit and gender self-schema, this research aims to examine UK university final year students' perception of the importance of organisational attributes and their presence in three major graduate employers. This study also seeks to explore which organisational attributes attract Generation Y men and women to apply to a management trainee position. In phase one, 32 repertory grid interviews identify 84 common constructs in undergraduates' organisational choice. A short list of 20 organisational attributes was carried forward to the phase two survey of 862 undergraduates in their final year at 22 UK universities. The respondents rate the attributes in terms of importance and then evaluate three employers in terms of perceived presence of these attributes. The students also provide the likelihood that they would apply. T-tests, correlation and multiple regression are used to test hypotheses. Among university students, the five most important organisational attributes are: 1. invest heavily in the training and development of their employees, 2. care about their employees as individuals, 3. clear opportunities for long-term career progression, 4. variety in daily work, and 5. dynamic, forward-looking approach to their business. Sex differences exist in both the importance of organisational attributes and the perceived extent of their presence in three organisations. Recruiting firms can better understand how Generation Y men and women graduates perceive the importance of organisational attributes and their presence in firms.

AB  - This paper examines a varity of examples of repertory grid research to assess how and why the technique is used. In particular, the authors focus on the strengths and weaknesses of using the repertory grid to explore the nature of close business-ot-business relationships. Compared with the more frequently used technique of qualitative depth interviews, differences were found which suggest that further research is needed to identify what really drives supplier-buyer interdependence. The research indicates the value of the repertory grid in exploring topics that are not well defined and to identify the way that business decision-makers are making sense of their work environment.

T1  - "That's not how I see it": female and male perspectives on the academic role
AN  - 213158166
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a piece of empirical work that examines gender differences in how academics make sense of performance within university business schools in the UK. The research reported draws on data collected using a life history and repertory grid methodology with male and female interviewees from two university business schools. The findings are discussed in relation to how academics understand what is valued about their role and what they believe the organisation rewards and values when it comes to promotion. Gender differences are shown to exist in the ways women and men define the academic role and in what they think is important both to themselves and the institution. The paper presents original data on gender differences within a business school context.

T1  - British army leadership: is it gendered?
AN  - 213155919
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of the female British Army officer, to determine whether female Army officers lead in different ways to male Army officers. The conceptual framework was transformational and transactional leadership theory. Data were gathered in semi structured interviews with 24 Army officers, split 50:50 between men and women using repertory grid, and critical incident methods. Women and men Army officers interviewed do lead in different ways with women demonstrating a gender management aspect to their leadership. The research also identified that women officers experience an "armoured glass" ceiling in terms of career progression, the research developed a conceptual model of military leadership that differs from the transformational/transactional leadership model. It also disconfirms contemporary leadership theory that conflates leadership and change management. The paper makes no claims for generalisability because of the unrepresentative sample. Further, research is needed on a representative sample basis. The paper may inform policy on the management and development of female Army officers. It may also have utility in improving leadership development in the British Army and other UK Armed Services. The paper makes a contribution in two areas; it adds to the growing body of research that indicates men and women lead in different ways and assessing the implications that flow from this.

T1  - Constructing urban green spaces: an application of Kelly's repertory grid
AN  - 1012272555
AB  - Purpose - Urban green spaces are valuable to residents for a variety of reasons and some degree of management is needed to ensure at least their preservation, if not enhancement, in a rapidly urbanising society. Intensification of the urban environment brings pressure upon the undeveloped spaces within a city and an understanding of the needs of residents is needed if green spaces are to be managed in alignment with their wishes, so that changes will be accepted. However, gaining such an understanding of the complex relationships between people and their environment is difficult. Constructs may exist that researcher, respondent, or both have not yet articulated. This paper sets out to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach - The repertory grid method is described as an approach that addresses this problem by researcher and respondent collectively, creating a survey instrument, which the respondent then completes. Findings - The repertory grid technique was applied in Zurich and revealed a surprisingly dominant anthropocentric attitude towards urban green spaces. Practical/implications - The universal anthropocentric perspective allows the interpretation that residents see Zurich essentially as a place for people and furthermore see green spaces as places for themselves to pursue their own interests. Originality/value - Application of this technique, in the context of an exploratory study, simultaneously provides direction for further research and demonstrates its utility as a tool for planners and managers of urban green spaces.

T1  - An Empirical Assessment of User Perceptions of Feature versus Application Level Usage
AN  - 200722167
AB  - Users often use application software because of particular features. However, little remains known on whether user perceptions of application use is merely feature-driven or whether users perceive their application use as being more than an amalgamation of features. As the software industry ushers trends such as Web services, it becomes evermore important for vendors and users alike to clarify how users perceive features and applications. The paper is an attempt to confirm whether users can perceptively unbundle application software features from the overall applications themselves. Using a modified version of the repertory grid technique, this study investigates user perceptions of application features using data collected from users in the design and development departments across five firms. The results suggest that user perceptions of overall applications overshadow their perceptions of independent features, suggesting application-level lock-in effects and pointing out the difficulty in vendor attempts to unbundle features from feature categories and applications. The study closes with a discussion of the findings and offering cues for future research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cognitive evaluation of information modeling methods
AN  - 196418183
AB  - In the field of information system engineering, information modeling method is a technique to capture user requirements and to understand system complexity. The importance of information modeling has been recognized by practitioners and researchers, but little has been explored to analyze the available information modeling methods or to evaluate them in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness. This research analyzes six information-modeling methods: use case diagram, rich picture diagram, entity-relationship diagram, Trochim's concept mapping, repertory grid, and causal mapping. These information-modeling methods are analyzed from a cognitive perspective in order to better understand their nature, the assumptions, and the important features associated. The research contributes to the understanding of the information modeling methods and their potential uses and values during IS development. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ascertaining consumer perspectives of medication information sources using a modified repertory grid technique
AN  - 222617999; 17187220
AB  - Objective  To establish the range of medicine information sources used by consumers and their perception of the reliability of these, using the repertory grid technique. Method  Consumers visiting three community pharmacies in Brisbane, Australia, were interviewed using the repertory grid technique. During the interview, consumers were asked to name up to three medicine information sources that they used for a supermarket medicine, an over-the-counter medicine and a prescription medicine. They were then presented with their named information sources in groups of three and asked to discriminate between these in terms of their perceived reliability of the information source. The descriptors used by the consumer to discriminate between the information sources are known as constructs and these were recorded. The consumer was then asked to rate each of their information sources against each generated construct. Main outcome measure  The range of information sources generated was determined along with the perceived reliability of these from the calculated median score of each information source when rated on each generated construct. Results  A total of 110 consumers were interviewed and identified 648 information sources that they would use. The most frequent information sources cited by the 110 consumers were their doctor (83%), written information (90%) and the pharmacist (78%). There were a total of 299 constructs generated by 88 of the consumers and these were themed into 16 discrete categories. The most common generated constructs themes were "good knowledge" (15%), "training" (14%) and "trustworthiness" (13%). The consumer perception of their information sources were that the doctor and pharmacist have good knowledge (median score 1) and are trained (median score 1) and were perceived to be trustworthy (median score 3 and 2, respectively). Conclusion  The repertory grid technique was successful in identifying the information sources consumers accessed to find out about their medicines and in identifying the perception of these sources in terms of their reliability. The repertory grid technique offers a novel method for future research into consumer preferences for different treatment options. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - International Business Tourism: Destination Dublin or Destination Ireland?
AN  - 196609038
AB  - The Republic of Ireland has been running the same basic brand proposition in its various marketing campaigns for some decades (Morgan, Pritchard and Pride, 2002). However, it is unclear whether the destination brand construct that has served Ireland's general tourism market so well can apply equally when attracting business tourism to Dublin, the nation's capital city. This research primarily applies repertory grid analysis and on-line focus groups to understand the brand of Dublin, the capital of Ireland, and explores the way the marketing of a national capital city for business tourism both influences, and is influenced by, the marketing of the nation itself.

T1  - Towards a theory of visitors' evaluation of historical districts as tourism destinations: Frameworks and methods*
AN  - 196327996
AB  - This study aims to illustrate the complex nature of visitors' evaluation of historical districts as tourism destinations and how this complex nature can be understood and investigated. The literature review suggested a theoretical framework based on relationships between visitors' mental states and a district's features. Personal interviews employing Repertory Grid Analysis and Laddering Analysis with use of photographs of a historical district in Takayama-shi, Japan were conducted with a sample of Japanese students. The results illustrate that these methods elucidate issues argued in past studies and may be effective in investigating visitors' evaluation of historical districts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using the repertory grid and laddering technique to determine the user's evaluative model of search engines
AN  - 217962931
AB  - Purpose  - The purpose of this research is to explore a method for the determination of users' representations of search engines, formed during their interaction with these systems. Determines the extent to which these elicited "mental models" indicate the system aspects of importance to the user and from this their evaluative view of these tools. Design/methodology/approach  - The repertory grid technique is used to elicit a set of constructs that define facets within the mental model of an individual. A related technique of laddering then considers each of the user's constructs to determine the reasons for its importance within the user's mental model. Findings  - The model derived from the qualitative data comprises three hierarchical strata and conveys the interrelations between basic system description, evaluative description, and the key evaluations of ease, efficiency, effort and effectiveness. Two additional layers relating to the perceived process and the experience of emotion are also discussed. Research limitations/implications  - Ten participants is considered to be optimum for obtaining constructs in a repertory grid, but limits the findings to the context of the user group and the systems used in this study. Originality/value  - The methodology has not previously been used to determine mental models of search engines and from these to understand users' evaluative view of systems. The resulting model of key evaluations with the conjunctions of procedural elements suggests a framework for further research to evaluate search engines from the user perspective.

T1  - So, You Think You Know Others' Goals? A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 215839037
AB  - People filter their observations of the world according to their interests, each person using his or her own conceptual framework. So, when we ask them to describe something, their descriptions differ: they might focus on different aspects and choose different terms. In requirements analysis, stakeholders can have varied expertise areas, distinct responsibilities, and divergent goals. As a result, they often express themselves using ambiguous or conflicting terms. Such mismatches in stakeholders' vocabulary can be very hard to detect. We call this terminological interference. Analysis of terminological interference is possible only if we can discover relationships between stakeholders' mental models and the terms they use to describe them. George Kelly's Personal Construct Theory address this issue. According to PCT, individuals develop their own set of mental constructs to help make sense of their environment. Researchers have used this theory to develop techniques for exploring personal construct, most notably the Repertory Grid Technique. The RGT elicits personal constructs by asking people to compare and contrast objects in the domain of interest. Recent research in requirements engineering (RE) has generated a number of notations for modeling stakeholders' goals and the relationships between them. However, the community has paid little attention to how stakeholders can develop consensus on the meaning of the goals in a goal model. In this article, we show how to use the RGT to compare stakeholders' terms when they describe their softgoals (goals whose satisfaction can't be established in a clear-cut sense). We conducted a pilot study for a nonprofit organization to demonstrate our approach. The study shows that the technique can readily identify agreements and mismatches in stakeholders' terminologies and can be performed without preliminary training or specific resources.

T1  - Articulating appraisal system effectiveness based on managerial cognitions
AN  - 214801697
AB  - The aim of this article is to investigate how managers see, interpret and make sense of their performance management system experiences and recommend the way forward for both policy and practice, in what makes effective appraisal systems. The study applied the repertory grid to elicit the personal constructs of how managers make sense of their appraisal experiences. The cognitive mapping methodology allows the researcher to go deep into the respondents' "theories in use" to provide new insights on how they "think". This, in turn, allows a better understanding of the language managers use to make sense of the experiences. Core conceptual dimensions, cognitive maps and cluster diagrams were generated, providing implications for research, practice and new directions for future research. Although the application of the grid technique was time-consuming, the finer grain level of analysis provided a deeper appreciation of managers' "theories in use". The study provides a cross-sectional view of the current state of managerial cognitions. Findings open up new ways of thinking and new way of doing in appraisal research and practice.

T1  - Trust and technologies: Implications for organizational work practices
AN  - 206601958
AB  - In this paper, we empirically investigate the concept of trust across organizational work practices by examining three groups: within the team, between teams and when interacting with technology. This study adopts Repertory Grid methodology as an interview based technique to elicit important constructs of trust to engineering teams working in two organizations within the energy distribution industry. Thirteen key constructs of trust were identified using content analysis. Drawing on the understanding gained, this paper discusses the implications for theories on trust within teams working with technology across organizations and provides a grounded perspective that could be used as a basis for further research.

T1  - "... There's so much going on unspoken in the back of the mind ..." -The Use of Repertory Grid Technique as a Qualitative Heuristic Research Design to Understand Teachers' Perceptions of Parents
AN  - 869228501
AB  - Studying subjective attitudes has to answer the question about the possibilities of expressing personal systems of meanings and about the possibilities of reconstructing the verbalized meanings by the researchers. Investigating teachers' perceptions of parents leads to two additional problems: teachers' rule of neutrality--which demands not making emotional and degrading statements--, and the normative orientation of "partnership" with parents--which is currently being increasingly discussed in the context of school-development and which makes teachers justify their working together with parents. The Repertory Grid Technique as a method of interview design supports the teachers who have been questioned in verbalizing individual perceptions of parents without using common phrases in their statements. But explicitly integrating the method in a qualitative design raises new questions: According to the currently prevailing orientation towards the typical quantitative Grid-data, qualitative designs are of little interest, so one cannot rely on proven procedures. The procedure described in this article is characterized by using the complete transcription of the interviews with teachers and the analysis of them as texts. The quantitative grid data are only collected for heuristic purposes. This article is a contribution to the discussion of the possibilities of realizing the qualitative potentials of Repertory Grid Technique.              URN: urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs070197

T1  - The Elaboration of Personal Construct Psychology
AN  - 205799055
AB  - More than half a century has passed since the publication of George Kelly's (1955/1991) The Psychology of Personal Constructs. This review considers the elaboration of personal construct psychology (PCP) during this time, both by Kelly and by others who developed his ideas. Advances to the theory have principally concerned implicative relationships between constructs, construing of the self, social relationships, emotions, links with other approaches, and supporting research. With regard to methods of assessment of construing, major developments have occurred in both repertory grid and nongrid techniques, such as laddering. The principal advances in the applications of PCP have been in the clinical, educational, and organizational fields, but have by no means been limited to these areas. It can be concluded that PCP has met Kelly's own design specifications for a useful theory and that PCP can perhaps anticipate at least another half-century of elaboration. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Multiple Museum Construct Motivators: a Multivariable Analysis with Repertory Grid Analysis (RGA) Approach
AN  - 1699001707
AB  - This paper aims to present and highlight the importance of factors resulting from Repertory Grid Analysis (R.G.A.). Strategic planning management issues concerning the management of museum audience are studied. A short description of the R.G.A. and the corresponding literature is cited, and an empirical application of the aforementioned method in a sample of 128 university students, takes place. The application of RGA produced 1345 interpretation models (constructs) which were coded and analyzed with three multivariable statistical techniques. The paper clearly demonstrates the importance of the analysis of constructs in relation to the management (local authorities or private institutions) suggestions that concern the museums of a specific area. Also, it contributes to the evolution of a new research area for the Destination Marketing Management with emphasis on Place design practices and development. Cultural offers and special managerial suggestions about particular groups of museums (strategic museum groups), are also discussed.

T1  - Je Ne Veux Pas Faire Ou Je Ne Peux Pas Faire ? Apports Epistemologiques Et Methodologiques De La Philosophie De Paul Ricoeur A La Critique Du Concept D'Agence
AN  - 1698435120
AB  - La théorie des incitations, rapprochée de la théorie de l'agence dans le champ comptable, comprend deux grandes dimensions, le vouloir agir et le pouvoir agir, mais cette dernière composante n'a été que très peu analysée. Les travaux de Paul Ricoeur permettent de montrer qu'en s'intéressant exclusivement aux incitations comme un correctif de la (mauvaise) volonté des agents, la théorie de l'agence nie la capacité d'agir de ceux-ci et risque ainsi de favoriser des dispositifs de gestion qui augmentent l'incapacité. Pour répondre au défi méthodologique posé par cette nouvelle perspective, nous présentons la théorie des construits personnels et la technique du repertory grid élaborées par George Kelly.

T1  - Consumer research: extrinsic variables in food studies
AN  - 225134703
AB  - The article aims to address two questions: "What are the important extrinsic variables in consumer food studies?" and "Which are focused on the most?" An extensive search of previous literature was conducted to find data on papers related to extrinsic variables in food studies. Both an electronics search through computerized library databases (Web of Science, Food Science and Technology Abstract), and reference lists from relevant research papers were used. The article finds that acceptance and intention to purchase measures regarding foods are associated with consumption and purchase process and are used as an indirect way of obtaining data to understand consumer behavior. Although the importance of intrinsic variables such as color, aroma, flavor and texture in food acceptance and choice are very well recognized, several studies have shown that other variables also play an important role in food acceptance, preference, choice and intention to purchase. This article presents the more studied extrinsic variables using the conjoint analysis and repertory grid methods. This article shows data only on repertory grid and conjoint analysis. There are other methodologies such as focus group, laddering interviews and questionnaires that can be used to investigate the role of extrinsic variables on consumer attitude. Context variables are the most studied extrinsic variables. Production method, nutritional information, protected denomination of origin/certification and origin are some of these variables and are directly linked with consumer concerns about the product. The authors believe that the change in consumer behavior globally drives the search for motives that better explain choices.

T1  - Using a Functional Approach to Change Preservice Teachers' Understanding of Mathematics Software
AN  - 274692932
AB  - This study examined the structure of two preservice teachers' understandings of educational software in mathematics using repertory grid techniques. Specifically, the study focused on how teacher educators can enable preservice teachers to discern the features of mathematics software, and develop pedagogical goals that reflect the affordances and constraints of available tools. Results showed a deepening of knowledge and a differentiation of knowledge following experiences of exploration, evaluation, and comparison of different types of software. Results imply that directing preservice teachers' attention to utilizing the functional characteristics of software for developing plans and for the design of instruction may be fruitful for more effective integration of software in their future teaching. However, participants' preexisting content knowledge and their pedagogical worldview tempered this effect. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Making a difference: On the constraints of consensus building and the relevance of deliberation in stakeholder dialogues
AN  - 221249278
AB  - This article illuminates the contribution of stakeholder dialogues to environmental policy making. It makes a distinction between stakeholder dialogues as consensus building  and stakeholder dialogues as deliberation. Although consensus building seems to be the dominant approach in participatory environmental policy making, this article questions the merits of consensus building and it uses the experience of the Dutch stakeholder dialogue project Climate OptiOns for the Long term (COOL) to explore, in a deliberative design, the shortcomings of a consensus-building approach and how they are possibly dealt with. The article presents the results of two deliberative methods that have been used in the COOL project - the repertory grid analysis and the dialectical approach - to demonstrate how a deliberative design can help policy makers to critically assess arguments in favor of and against a broad range of policy options, and deal with stakeholder conflict in an early phase of the policy process.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - TAIWANESE REGULATORS' PERCEPTIONS OF ACCOUNTING CONVERGENCE
AN  - 208151538
AB  - This paper constructs the 'mental maps' of eight Taiwanese regulators responsible for accounting convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards. A phenomenological paradigm is adopted and the Repertory Grid Technique used for in-depth interviews. The results demonstrate that the regulators experience tension in their roles as advocates of convergence and guardians of the existing system. The perceived need to protect business interests, combined with the residual influence of standards issued by the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board, as well as insufficient resources, have led to a tripartite structure of standards.

T1  - Teachers' tendencies to promote student-led science projects: Associations with their views about science
AN  - 194929464
AB  - School science students can benefit greatly from participation in student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects. For various possible reasons, however, students tend not to be engaged in such inquiries. Among factors that may limit their opportunities to engage in open-ended inquiries of their design are teachers' conceptions about science. To explore possible relationships between teachers' conceptions about science and the types of inquiry activities in which they engage students, instrumental case studies of five secondary science teachers were developed, using field notes, repertory grids, samples of lesson plans and student activities, and semistructured interviews. Based on constructivist grounded theory analysis, participating teachers' tendencies to promote student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects seemed to correspond with positions about the nature of science to which they indicated adherence. A tendency to encourage and enable students to carry out student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects appeared to be associated with adherence to social constructivist views about science. Teachers who opposed social constructivist views tended to prefer tight control of student knowledge building procedures and conclusions. We suggest that these results can be explained with reference to human psychological factors, including those associated with teachers' self-esteem and their relationships with knowledge-building processes in the discipline of their teaching.

T1  - Modelling of risk management in health care facilities
AN  - 219656840
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the use of neural networks in healthcare facilities risk management. The data used to develop the input to the national health service facilities risk exposure system was solicited from 60 healthcare managers. Risk exposure system has been developed using the risk knowledge that was articulated from experienced healthcare operators through postal questionnaires and repertory grid interviews. This knowledge was then transformed and represented in Trajan 4.0, an expert system shell that uses artificial neural networks as its modeling technique. It provides healthcare facilities operators an avenue to evaluate their own risk management method (point score system) based on their own healthcare business knowledge/judgment and corporate objectives for various facilities management service operations.

AB  - Starting with a critique of the orientation of methodological training in academic psychology the essay highlights the appropriateness of method and the encouragement of cooperation as criteria for methodical professionalism. The Repertory Grid interview is introduced as a method which serves both criteria. The reviewed book (Martin FROMM) and the corresponding software (Martin FROMM & Andreas BACHER) serve as an adequate introduction to this method. Nevertheless, a research question is needed that is rational and well implemented within the field of inquiry.              URN: urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs060263

T1  - Exploring parental reactions to the diagnosis of cleft lip and palate
AN  - 218915773; 16634379
AB  - The birth of an infant with a facial cleft evokes a range of emotions and reactions in parents. During acceptance of a child's disability, parents are said to progress through several stages similar to those responses reported in the bereavement process. This paper describes the process of adapting in terms of personal construct theory, and reports a pilot of the repertory grid technique as a therapeutic tool to elicit parental reactions following diagnosis of cleft lip and palate. Two mothers compared other significant life events to their reactions to the diagnosis of cleft lip and palate. This pilot supported the use of the repertory grid technique as a means to facilitate exploration of parental responses. Comparisons to the bereavement process were evident, although individual reactions or perceptions may differ from those expected. Recommendations are made for a wider research study within cleft lip and palate.

T1  - Experiences Conducting Cross-Cultural Research
AN  - 195151585
AB  - When conducting cross-cultural investigations, it is incumbent upon the information systems researcher to be prepared to reflect upon the differences between the frameworks of the researcher and the research participants. Three cross-cultural projects are discussed in this article. The first project, investigating systems analysts, employs the Repertory Grid from Personal Construct Theory (Kelly, 1955, 1963). The second and third projects both employ Narrative Inquiry (Bruner, 1990). The second project investigates the use of information systems by small business and relies upon multiple regional researchers. The third project, which is currently ongoing, investigates the emerging role of chief information officers and is a single researcher venture. These projects have contributed to the information systems field of study and are presented here to provide researchers with ideas for further qualitative cross-cultural investigations.

AB  - This article offers a conceptual framework for classifying attributes of offerings in a business-marketing context. Typologies on the nature of product-related attributes and classification of industrial products are synthesized for viewing levels of product meaning. Repertory grid procedures first developed in clinical psychology and recently adapted for use in business settings are presented as an approach for eliciting salient/determinant attributes. Enhanced effectiveness of the classic industrial selling process is demonstrated along with implications for managing the sales force. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Consumers' perception of wine packaging: a case study
AN  - 235113349
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present the methodology adopted and the main results achieved by an exploratory study on consumers perception of wine packaging. The research was designed to elicit the relevant dimensions through which consumers perceive and describe differences between bottles of wine. In order to allow respondents to freely express their perceptions without suggesting a priori descriptive category/dimensions a repertory grid (RGT) approach was followed. A sample of 30 consumers were asked to analyze differences across 11 bottles and to summarize them in descriptive bipolar constructs. The results were analyzed performing a consensus procrustes analysis. The attributes of bottles and labels represent the main factors underlying wine packaging perceptions. These characteristics are the very first "signal" perceived looking at bottles. Consumers use them to define more abstract "constructs" they use while assessing alternative products and choosing among them. From a methodological point of view, this study confirms the interest of combining RGT and content analysis as a tool for explorative research in marketing.

T1  - Swedish auditors' view of auditing: Doing things right versus doing the right things
AN  - 232931722
AB  - The thought patterns of Swedish auditors with regard to the way in which they audit information provided by listed companies, and possible changes in their duties, are described and analyzed. Eighty-two auditors were interviewed using the repertory grid technique and open-ended interview questions. To check the stability in the thought patterns of the respondents, six retests were made and, to validate the findings, an expert panel and two reference groups consisting of auditors and other representatives of the accounting and auditing professions were consulted. Distinct patterns emerged in the mean grid of the thought patterns of all the respondents. One dimension was related to the time perspective, past versus future, and another to auditing practice. Auditors devote a relatively long time and considerable effort to objects that can be satisfactorily verified, but not to objects that they perceive as being of primary importance to investors and other stakeholders. This inconsistency in the thought patterns of the auditors is similar to the gap between auditing in practice and stakeholders' expectations of auditing, which is a phenomenon frequently found in previous research. Moreover, the auditors were very reluctant to make statements about any information except that elicited according to current practice. In addition to this traditional view, the auditors appear to be more concerned about their own situation than that of the parties they are meant to be protecting. Doing things right seems to be more important than doing the right things. That the auditors spend much time on objects that they themselves do not consider to be of primary importance for the investors and other stakeholders, and their unwillingness to change current practice is of great concern in Sweden, where there is a strong belief in self-regulation of the auditing profession.

T1  - COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES IN REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION AND THE USE OF THE REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE
AN  - 232577832
AB  - Requirements elicitation is a central and critical activity in the systems analysis and design process. This paper explores the nature of the challenges that confront analysts and their clients during requirements elicitation. A review of the literature highlights communication as a persistent locus of concern among systems analysts, users and procurers. The paper presents a classification of communication challenges that arise during the requirements elicitation process. Empirical evidence from a brief case study is used to illustrate the scope and impact of these communication challenges and to present a complementary approach to requirements elicitation. The paper introduces the Repertory Grid technique as a means to ameliorate some of the communication issues that persist, particularly in projects where information systems support specialized work. The paper is written in the form of a case tutorial, providing insight into the contribution of the Repertory Grid technique to requirements elicitation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A problem structuring front end for a multiple criteria decision support system
AN  - 195837375
AB  - Structuring a problem is a key part of decision making. For multiple criteria decision problems, defining the criteria is an important element of the structuring process. To provide a decision maker with a general instrument for identifying relevant criteria, two methods representing different approaches were empirically evaluated. This evaluation showed that Kelly's repertory grid technique in particular has several useful features. Accordingly, the repertory grid technique was adapted to build a problem structuring front end for the aspiration-level interactive method proposed by Lotfi, Stewart, and Zionts.

T1  - Evaluating stigma among infertile men and women in Iran
AN  - 1020894174
AB  - Introduction: Psycho-social aspects of physical disability may create more problems for the indi-vidual than the disability itself. The infertile may suffer from misjudgments or prejudices in different situations by their colleagues and relatives. All factors for this suffering can be evaluated in stigma settings which the infertile confront. In addition to these pathological settings, there are some opportunities which infertile people can enjoy for more adaptations with their social envi-ronments. The objective of this study was to become familiarized with different aspects of psycho- social life of the in fertile in the setting of Iranian culture.

              
Materials & Methods: 268 fertile and infertile subjects were involved in this study from two different regions of Iran. Through a considerable number of interviews with infertile individuals in the pilot study, the styles of social interaction with people and also positive and negative cons-tructs related to their social lives were recognized. Utilizing a suitable instrument (Repertory grid) and factor analysis of scores, disability factors concerning social aspects of infertility were disco-vered. Moreover, regression analysis and t-test (p< .05) were used for the analysis of the data.

              
Results: The statistical analysis including t-test, factor and regression analyses indicated that social comparison, as one of the sources for self, has an imminent role in the prediction of psycho-social adjustment of infertile individuals. Meanwhile, the infertile women showed more negative views in the elements "comparison with fertile people" and "my view toward infertility" but both fertile and infertile subjects did not show any significant differences in psychosocial adjustments.

              
Conclusion: From the three sources of self-knowledge, social comparison, social feedback and self-observation, social comparison plays the first role and social feedback the second in the construction of stigma among infertile people. The results of this study showed the necessity of a health-oriented approach in the evaluation of psycho-social aspects of physical disability among infertile people and also the necessity of modifying and equalizing the functions of the three sources of self-knowledge through group therapy sessions.

AB  - The job of training and learning professionals requires good management of resources -- time and money -- and a good feel for the way the organization works. Many different players are responsible for driving and delivering people development. It is the manager's credibility and their relationship with these players -- particularly senior management -- that determine their success. No-one was ever sacked because they did not undertake a repertory grid. However, because the underlying need is evident, it does not necessarily mean that the training solution is obvious.

T1  - Reflection on teaching and the scholarship of teaching: Focus on science instructors
AN  - 740314111
AB  - Reflection on teaching in higher education remains poorly understood. This exploratory study had three goals. First, to test, empirically yet in an exploratory way, the applicability of a particular model of reflection. Second, to identify objective indicators of reflection on knowledge about teaching with the intent to make the process of reflection more concrete, visible, and its outcomes valid. Third, in line with the exploratory nature of the study, to shed light on some variables that might be linked to observed differences in reflection, which could be investigated more systematically through future research. The model of reflection guiding the study was based on Mezirow's transformative learning theory. It distinguishes three kinds of reflection: on content, process and premises. These take place within three domains of knowledge about teaching: instruction, pedagogy, and curriculum. Thirty-six instructors of science participated in a semi-structured interview based on the model and completed a repertory grid, which incorporated their beliefs about teaching as identified through the Approaches of Teaching Inventory (ATI). While all instructors showed evidence of reflection that were in line with the model, differences were observed in the extent or kind of reflection they engaged in. Across all three knowledge domains, premise reflection was observed the least often. Results suggested that years of experience and beliefs about teaching might play a role in the extent to which academics are inclined to engage in reflection. The study also identified concrete indicators of reflection, which could be helpful for academic staff evaluation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Prompting conceptual understanding with computer-mediated peer discourse and knowledge acquisition techniques
AN  - 229771824
AB  - Numerous computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools have been designed to facilitate group discourses on the Web. However, previous studies noted that participants did not value online conferencing as a method for conducting in-depth discussions, and instead considered this method as merely scratching the surface of the issues involved. Therefore, the teachers must moderate the online discourse to add value to the success of CMC. This study presents a methodology that uses knowledge acquisition techniques during online discourses to increase student conceptual understanding and evaluation skills. The methodology explains the conceptual frameworks of individuals and the conceptual relationships between student peers. Active database triggers then are applied to automatically monitor the conceptual relationships and to moderate online discourses between student peers. Student reactions demonstrated that discourses mediated by the repertory grid analysis technique helped group members not only promote common conceptual understandings but also to approach the level of conceptual understanding of the teacher.

T1  - Improving team performance using repertory grids
AN  - 217099848
AB  - This paper seeks to explore how repertory grids can be used to address IT team performance issues. The technique is introduced along with the process of creating and analyzing repertory grid data. The approach is to explore the application of the repertory grid technique to team performance issues. An example focused on eliciting the essential soft skills needed by programmers to effectively interact with IT team members is illustrated. To researchers, the main benefit of this paper is that it introduces a technique that is easy to use, enables the researcher to easily determine the relationship between constructs, is free from researcher bias, and can be applied to a wide variety of team-related research studies. This research presents a means by which human resource managers, hiring personnel, and team leaders can easily determine essential skills needed on the IT teams of the organization, thereby deriving a "wish list" from key IT groups as to the desired non-technical characteristics of potential new team members.

T1  - THE USE OF RGT (REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE) IN MEASURING THE IMAGE OF SHOPPING CENTERS: REVISTA DE ADMINISTRAÇÃO E INOVAÇÃO REVISTA DE ADMINISTRAÇÃO E INOVAÇÃO
AN  - 883063317
AB  - With the number and variety of shopping centers in Brazil increasing, there is greater pressure on the practitioners of marketing to better understand how consumers choose shopping centers both as shopping and leisure areas. This study suggests that the technique of the repertory grid (RGT) is superior to other techniques which are generally used to evaluate the dimensions which a consumer uses to evaluate a shopping center. The main advantage of the repertory grid is that the dimensions through which an object is evaluated and its relative importance are directly obtained from the consumer with no interference from the researcher. The study introduces a number of necessary basic concepts to understand the application of the technique and the theory on which it is based, the psychology of personal constructs developed by Kelly (1955). The study also presents a number of hypothetical examples of how to apply the technique and its main limitations.

T1  - Gossip and emotion in nursing and health-care organizations
AN  - 197381746; 16206920
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between gossip and emotion in health-care organizations. It draws on findings from empirical research exploring the characteristics and function of gossip which, to date, has been a relatively under-researched organizational phenomenon. A multidisciplinary approach was adopted, drawing on an eclectic range of discipline-based theories, skills, ideas and data. Methods included repertory grid technique, in-depth interviews and structured diary records of work-related gossip. The sample comprised 96 qualified nurses working in a range of practice areas and organizational settings in the UK. Template analysis was used to integrate findings across three phases of data collection. The findings revealed that gossip is used to express a range of emotions including care and concern about others, anger, annoyance and anxiety, with emotional outcomes that include feeling reassured and supported. It is the individual who gossips, while the organization provides the content, emotional context, triggers and opportunities. Nurses were chosen as an information-rich source of data, but the findings may simply reflect the professional culture and practice of nursing. Future research should take into account a wider range of health-care organizational roles and perspectives in order to capture the dynamics and detail of the emotions and relationships that initiate and sustain gossip. Because gossip makes people feel better it may serve to reinforce the "stress mask of professionalism", hiding issues of conflict, vulnerability and intense emotion. Managers need to consider what the emotions expressed through gossip might represent in terms of underlying issues relating to organizational health, communication and change. This paper makes a valuable contribution to the under-researched phenomenon of gossip in organizations and adds to the growing field of research into the role of emotion in health-care organizations and emotion work in nursing.

AN  - 196917601
AB  - Although sorting techniques (e.g. card sorts) are widely used in knowledge acquisition and requirements acquisition, they have received little formal attention compared to related techniques such as repertory grids and laddering. This paper briefly describes the main sorting techniques, and then provides a detailed tutorial on one variety (repeated single-criterion sorts), using a worked example. Guidelines for choice and sequencing of techniques are given, both in relation to varieties of sorting technique and in relation to other techniques. It is concluded that the sorting techniques are a valuable part of the elicitor's methodological toolkit. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 230465738
AB  - A current popular theme in medicine concerns whether and how patients should be involved in treatment choice. Assuming patient involvement is desirable, how should one go about eliciting preferences? A variety of quantitative and qualitative methods exist that may be used for this purpose, one of which is the repertory grid method. This method involves eliciting constructs (reasons) for preferences through comparing sets of three options. This method allows the structured elicitation of the reasons behind individual preferences, but also, when used with generalised procrustes analysis (GPA), allows aggregation of individual data to reveal general preference patterns. In this study the repertory grid method was used to examine patient preferences for angina treatments with the goal of, first, gaining some understanding of general patterns of patient preference, and second, examining the likely utility of the technique in this setting. A sample of 21 patients with mild and stable angina from two general practices in Norfolk, UK was interviewed using the repertory grid method to elicit the constructs underlying their preferences amongst seven angina treatments (including 'no treatment'). Individualised questionnaires were then produced and sent to the patients for self-completion, which required rating the extent to which each construct was relevant for each treatment (scored on visual analogue rating scales). Analysis of the ratings, using GPA, showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: 'some treatment' versus 'no treatment', and drug treatment versus surgical treatment. While some treatment was generally preferred to no treatment, individuals varied in preference for drug treatments or surgical treatments. Although the latter were generally perceived as 'effective' they were also perceived, for example, as 'invasive', 'frightening', related to 'negative experiences', and being more appropriate for when symptoms are severe ('proportionate'). We consider the implications of these results for involving patients in choosing amongst treatments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Identity change and the human dissection experience over the first year of medical training
AN  - 230467568
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore identity change in medical students over their first year of medical training, particularly in relation to their experience of human dissection. Each of our four participants completed two repertory grids at the end of term one and, again, towards the end of term three. One grid tapped their identity construction, and the other, their experience of human dissection. Our participants were optimistic about becoming similar to a doctor they admired and, towards the end of term three, began to develop a stable identity as a medical student. Their identity constructs involved three common themes: dedication, competence, and responsibility. However, the data also revealed negative reactions to the demands of training, such as feeling driven and stressed. Three major themes were apparent in their experience of human dissection: involvement, emotional coping, and ability. Our participants' dedication to their studies was reflected in their appreciation of the need to become involved actively in the process of dissection but some experienced an erosion of their self-confidence and perceived some of their colleagues to have lost much of their enthusiasm for learning. Emotional coping could be an additional challenge within this context and their reaction tended to reflect distancing processes previously identified in the literature. In all, we see a development of a vulnerable sense of professionalism alongside a frustration of losing out potentially on wider aspects of personal development due to the high work demands.

T1  - Parental coping with sudden infant death after donor insemination: case report
AN  - 211897861; 15665018
AB  - We report the case of an artificial donor insemination couple experiencing sudden infant death of their 8-month-old child. Six months after the incident, the couple were investigated by means of an extensive interview, a repertory grid investigation and the Family Assessment Measure, as well as at 6 years after the incident by an extensive interview. The results show the importance of the diagnosis of male infertility and the preceding fertility treatment for coping with the death of their child. Six months after the incident, acute feelings associated with bereavement are mixed with feelings of anger and shame, apparently due to the experience of infertility. However, secrecy and shame associated with male infertility and donor insemination make it impossible for the couple to communicate their feelings to each other or to friends and relatives; furthermore, they decline psychological counselling. Repertory grid investigation and the Family Assessment Measure point to significant problems within the partnership. Six years after the incident, the couple's relationship is destabilized and both partners plan to divorce. We suggest a possible link between donor insemination secrecy and difficulties with coping. We discuss implications for couple counselling and emphasize the necessity for an improved legal framework for donor insemination in Germany.

T1  - Preception of bread: A comparison of consumers and trained assessors
AN  - 194415167
AB  - The main objective of this study was to investigate consumers' perception of bread and to compare the used vocabulary with descriptive attributes used by a trained panel. Perceived appropriateness of breads were also studied and related to the sensory perception. Seven different types of bread were chosen for the study. The breads were presented to 30 consumers, and the repertory grid method was used to obtain information about sensory perception and appropriateness of use. The breads were also presented to a trained sensory panel performing sensory profiling. Multivariate analyses of the data showed that the latent structure in consumers' perception of a selection of breads was similar to the latent structure in a trained panel's perception of the same breads. For verbal description of the texture, the 2 panels used many identical words. Moreover, multivariate analyses revealed the relationship between consumers' perception of the breads and the appropriateness of use. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Consumer perceptions of novel fruit and familiar fruit: A repertory grid application
AN  - 222672711
AB  - To explore how consumers perceive novel and familiar fruit, repertory grid interviews were carried out with 60 New Zealand women. Participants described their perceptions of nine fruit varying in familiarity. The data analysis established a two-dimensional stimuli space that separated samples with respect to familiarity and the amount of preparation required. Fruit that was familiar was characterised as being well liked, easily available in shops and by a number of different use situations. The primary association with novel fruit was that it was expensive. The participants could not readily think of use situations for fruit they were unfamiliar with. Consumers were separated into groups according to the trait of food neophobia, which pertains to an individual's stable propensity to approach or avoid novel foods. When comparing the most neophobic (n = 14; avoids novel foods) and most neophilic (n = 14; approaches novel foods), individuals perceptual differences were uncovered pertaining to which of the fruit were considered novel and to the suitability of some usage situations (cooking and for children). This finding contributed to the growing evidence of the relationship between food neophobia and consumers' everyday food-related behaviour. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Destination brand images: a business tourism perspective
AN  - 212678257
AB  - Most studies of destination brand images have been conducted from the perspective of the leisure tourist. This study identifies brand images from a business tourist perspective (people visiting destinations for business meetings, incentive events, conferences and exhibitions) and tests their relationship with perceived quality and commercial criteria. Data on the brand image attributes associated with 15 UK destinations promoting themselves as business tourism centres were collected via repertory grid analysis from a sample of 25 organisations using business tourism facilities. A self-completion questionnaire was used to measure managers' ratings of the perceived quality of each destination and the commercial criteria used to select a destination. The data were analysed and the content analysis identified eight clusters of brand image attributes. Subsequent factor analysis identified three underlying dimensions - overall destination attractiveness, functionality, and ambience. While all three were correlated with perceived quality, commercial criteria were dominated by a destination's functional rather than ambience attributes.

T1  - Leading with integrity: a qualitative research study
AN  - 197366841; 15588012
AB  - This research paper gives an account of a study into the relationship between leadership and integrity. There is a critical analysis of the current literature for effective, successful and ethical leadership particularly, integrity. The purpose and aim of this paper is to build on the current notions of leadership within the literature, debate contemporary approaches, focussing specifically on practices within the UK National Health Service in the early 21st century. This leads to a discussion of the literature on ethical leadership theory, which includes public service values, ethical relationships and leading with integrity. A small study was undertaken consisting of 18 interviews with leaders and managers within a District General Hospital. Using the Repertory Grid technique and analysis 15 themes emerged from the constructs elicited, which were compared to the literature for leadership and integrity and other studies. As well as finding areas of overlap, a number of additional constructs were elicited which suggested that effective leadership correlates with integrity and the presence of integrity will improve organisational effectiveness. The study identified that perceptions of leadership character and behaviour are used to judge the effectiveness and integrity of a leader. However, the ethical implications and consequences of leaders' scope of power and influence such as policy and strategy are somewhat neglected and lacking in debate. The findings suggest that leaders are not judged according to the ethical nature of decision making, and leading and managing complex change but that the importance of integrity and ethical leadership correlated with higher levels of hierarchical status and that it is assumed by virtue of status and success that leaders lead with integrity. Finally, the findings of this study seem to suggest that nurse leadership capability is developing as a consequence of recent national investment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Crudge and Johnson's article Using the Information Seeker to Elicit Construct Models for Search Engine Evaluation assesses the suitability of using repertory grid technique as a multi-dimensional evaluation instrument of Web search engines. Repertory grid technique is a structured technique for eliciting both the conceptual content embodied in an individual's mental model and the relationships which exist among these concepts. Bipolar statements - good-bad - were elicited from 10 first-year undergraduates in the Department of Information and Communications at Manchester Metropolitan University. It was determined that the repertory grid effectively derived categories of user-determined evaluative constructs, thus providing a user-centered evaluative instrument.[Publication Abstract]

T1  - Uncovering your customer's hidden needs
AN  - 224666707
AB  - The way companies 'listen' to their customers is changing as managers realise end users are often unable to articulate their needs and focus groups seldom lead to breakthrough product ideas. A vanguard of product developers has addressed the issue of hidden needs - needs which customers themselves do not always recognise - and some companies are using novel ways to capture them. The questionnaire has several drawbacks. The traditional fallback after questionnaires is the focus group. Repertory grid analysis was developed by psychologists to understand how individuals think and to uncover their cognitive 'maps', a technique that is ideal for developing new product ideas. Observation is another very effective hidden needs analysis technique. Another technique is the contextual interview.

T1  - Repertory Grid As a Means to Compare and Contrast Developmental Theorists
AN  - 198167772
AB  - This article reports on the use of a repertory grid as a tool for studying conceptual systems in line with Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory. Using 7-point construct continua, students rated the positions of major developmental theorists on various bipolar constructs (e.g., nature-nurture, continuity-discontinuity) representing salient developmental issues. The results of objective testing, combined with the findings from a brief survey of students' attitudes toward repertory grid assignments, indicated that a repertory grid is a useful pedagogical strategy in terms of organizing course content, encouraging students' conceptual understanding, and challenging students intellectually. Moreover, when conjoined with the opportunity for classroom discussion, this technique stimulates active participation in the learning process.

T1  - The complexity of consumers' cognitive structures and its relevance to consumer behavior
AN  - 196326818
AB  - Consumers make numerous product decisions every day. This decision-making process depends on the information processing style employed. A key factor here is the complexity of a consumer's cognitive structures (i.e., the sophistication of the structures used to organize information). Although this construct, cognitive complexity, holds much promise for consumer behavior, several questions remain to be answered and were addressed by the present research. First, the results of the present research indicate that the Repertory Grid, developed in social interaction contexts, is a reliable instrument for measuring cognitive complexity in the consumer behavior domain. Second, the results further suggest the presence of a generalizable - as well as a context-specific - component of cognitive complexity. The generalizable component of cognitive complexity indicates that these knowledge structures are transferable across related product categories. As such, cognitive complexity is likely to impact consumer processing of product information and advertising messages. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Repertory grid analysis: An application to the measurement of destination images
AN  - 236409017
AB  - The objective of this paper is to demonstrate and evaluate the use of repertory grid analysis (RGA) in the context of a study of destination brand images. The study explored the components of destination brand image from a business tourism perspective. RGA was used to identify the constructs used by events managers in a sample of 25 UK organisations to characterise the brand images of 15 UK towns and cities. The study identified eight categories of brand image attribute. Factor analysis reduced these to three higher level dimensions, an overall destination attractiveness dimension and two sub-dimensions: functionality and ambience. The paper concludes with a discussion of the benefits and limitations of RGA as a technique for measuring destination brand images and argues that it offers significant advantages over alternative techniques with regard to image measurement.

T1  - Mapping cognitions to better understand attitudinal and behavioral responses in appraisal research
AN  - 224884262
AB  - Perceptions are important in determining performance appraisal system success. The growing body of research in this area has clearly documented the differences in perceptions between appraisers and appraisees. However, many of these findings are predominately based on aspects of the system in judging its overall effectiveness and rely heavily on self-report questionnaire responses with weak methodological rigor. Not much is known about the deeper cognitive perceptions of appraisers and appraisees in better explaining their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. This paper breaks away from conventional questionnaire-generated perceptions and applies a unique clinical cognitive mapping methodology called the repertory grid technique to elicit the personal constructs of how real respondents perceive appraisal systems based on their real-life experiences. The method allowed the investigation to go much deeper than past research into the core perceptions that influenced respondents' attitudes and subsequent behaviors. Though the findings showed some commonality in personal constructions of appraisal systems with those found in the literature, new constructs, core perceptual dimensions, and collective cognitive maps were elicited for the very first time, opening up new questions and issues for further research. Implications to theory and practice are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The dimensions of management team performance: a repertory grid study
AN  - 218423197
AB  - Teamwork is a key feature of work in organizations and a central question in the extensive literature on teams concerns the ways that team performance can be measured. This paper summarizes the concept of team performance and, focussing on management teams, reports the results of an extensive study through 60 repertory grid structured interviews with members of management teams suggests seven factors that represent team performance. The factors are: team purpose; team organization; team leadership; team climate; interpersonal relations; team communications; and team composition. An eighth factor, team interaction with the wider organization, is suggested for theoretical considerations and is included in an eight-factor model of team performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A constructivist model for evaluating postgraduate supervision: a case study
AN  - 213734462
AB  - This paper presents a new constructivist model of knowledge development in a case study that illustrates how a group of postgraduate students defined and evaluated effective postgraduate supervision. This new model is based on "personal construct theory" and "repertory grid technology" which is combined with interviews and group discussion. It is argued that this approach leads to a more meaningful interpretation of results and facilitates formative evaluation and professional development of supervisors. In this case study we discuss details of our evaluation method and its benefits and limitations. We explain how this approach enables both supervisors and students to participate actively in research and development activities, to develop their own constructs or theories of effective supervision, and to communicate their suggestions for improvement. Further applications of this constructivist model to postgraduate supervision practice and to research in higher education are suggested. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A repertory grid evaluation of a multidimensional theory of courage
AN  - 305174778
AB  - Courage is a fairly common expression of behavior, with benefits for society as well as the courageous actor. As often as it is identified in the media or literature, little research has directly studied courage as it has been difficult to define. Courage has been described as comprising three types: physical courage (i.e., physical action for a socially valued goal), moral courage (i.e., authentic expression of one's values and beliefs despite possible risk), and vital courage (i.e., perseverance to maintain physical or emotional well-being). This study sought to evaluate laypersons' views of the nature of courage. Two main questions were asked: how is courage conceptualized by people in everyday life, and how do other factors such as age and gender relate to views of courage? College-age adults and adults over age 40 completed a repertory grid measure used to compare courageous situations. The grid measure provided scores of construct integration (i.e., variability of intensity), level of differentiation among elements and constructs (i.e., construct ordination, element ordination), cognitive differentiation (i.e., matching score), and meaningfulness of ratings (i.e., extremity analysis). By categorizing the courageous situations provided by participants according to the type of courage suggested, moral courage was most frequently reflected by the situations. Younger and older adults were consistent in listing situations of moral courage most often, followed by vital and physical courage, respectively. One hypothesis was that there would be age-related differences on the repertory grid scores due to changes associated with aging and gaining life experience. The analyses demonstrated no differences among older and younger participants for the repertory grid scores, except for an effect of age on extremity analysis scores. A second hypothesis was that differences would be detected according to gender; this was not supported by analyses. Participants for this study were obtained from classes at Michigan State University, community centers in East Lansing, Michigan and personal contacts of the researcher. The lack of difference due to age or gender suggests few differences between how people conceptualize courage according to scores of construct integration or cognitive differentiation.

T1  - The changes in ex-mental patients attending a psychiatric rehabilitation program with holistic care
AN  - 305051477
AB  - It is well documented that most patients with chronic mental illness suffer from severe psychosocial dysfunction. Recent studies also suggest many patients have spiritual problems. A review of the present psychiatric rehabilitation services in Hong Kong shows that it lacks structured rehabilitation programs especially the informal community programs in the form of self-help group (SHG). Furthermore, spiritual support is also neglected in most if not all of the psychiatric rehabilitation programs.    This research aims to study the changes and the related factors in ex-mental patients attending the psychiatric rehabilitation program with holistic care organized by a Christian non-government organization, which has successfully formed 12 SHGs within the past 10 years. This holistic care rehabilitation program is characterized by a SHG approach with a holistic care content in which spiritual support is much emphasized. Spiritual intervention is in the form of hymn singing, Bible reading, personal sharing and intercessions.    A mixed research method with three studies was adopted to examine the changes of the participants in the program. In the first study, a non-equivalent group design was used to measure the changes indexed by objective outcome indicators. A control group (N = 154) with no randomization but matched with the experimental group (N = 109) was used for comparison. In the second study, in-depth interviews with the participants (N = 20) were used to measure their subjective experiences in the group. In the third study, repertory grid tests based on 19 informants were used to measure the changes in terms of the self-identity system.   The findings in Study 1 showed that those who joined the SHG had more friends and more satisfaction socially than those without joining the group. Duration of attendance, religious and group involvement were three key factors related to the change of functioning of the group members. In Study 2, the subjective experiences of the participants were positive and they perceived positive changes in the group. SHG was also perceived as a useful means to reduce loneliness and enhance rehabilitation. The findings based on the repertory grid method in Study 3 showed that there were perceived positive changes in the self-identity system of the informants. They perceived themselves more similar to the ideal self and an ideal ex-mental patient while more dissimilar to an unsuccessful person.    An integration of findings from all three studies suggests that the program was beneficial to their participants in the physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects with dominant positive changes in the psychosocial dimension. The findings also underscore the therapeutic forces available in small groups and the positive effect of the long-term nature of SHG. Furthermore, the study indicates the importance of spiritual intervention and its therapeutic values in psychiatric rehabilitation.

T1  - The brand images of tourism destinations: A study of the saliency of organic images
AN  - 220604538
AB  - Assesses the relative saliency of image attributes associated with history, heritage and culture in shaping the perceptions of places as tourism destinations. Such images tend to have been formed over a long period of time and result from exposure to communication processes largely outside marketing's core sphere of influence such as education, literature and the arts. Images formed in this way are referred to in this paper as organic images. The research used the repertory grid technique developed by George A. Kelly in the context of Personal Construct Theory combined with depth interviews to elicit the attributes associated with the images of 25 destinations in the UK. The study identified 11 categories of image attribute. Those associated with a destination's history, heritage and culture were found to be the second most salient category. The implications of these findings are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An instrument to elicit teachers' beliefs and assumptions: ELT
AN  - 236359160
AB  - Teachers' beliefs influence the acceptance and uptake of new approaches, techniques, and activities, and therefore play an important part in teacher development. Consequently, trainers running teacher education courses should consider encouraging participants to think about their personal beliefs and theories about teaching before providing input. This article proposes the use of an instrument designed to elicit teachers' beliefs based on Kelly's (1969) theory of personal constructs, using an adapted version of his repertory grid technique.

T1  - Studying Trust in Virtual Organizations
AN  - 224074942
AB  - The core objective of this article is to introduce the repertory grid technique as a powerful methodology into research on trust in virtual organizations. This technique is particularly capable of yielding insights into the subjective meaning of trust. Virtual organizations have been chosen as our empirical field because the literature shows a broad consensus that trust is one of the most important success factors for the initiation, development, and continuation of activities in these types of hybrid regimes. On the basis of a discussion of the literature on trust in networks and virtual organizations, we present our empirical study of two Swiss virtual organizations. It reveals that the emergence of trust in virtual organizations depends strongly on personal bonds and shared experiences in the practical realization of projects, whereas generalized rules and contracts play only a supplementary role. Localized and experience-based commitments as well as the proactive behavior of the partners involved are identified as decisive denominators of trust. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Eliciting and analysing employees' expectations of a merger
AN  - 231482823
AB  - The merger of the head offices of two public service organizations in Sweden was used to examine difference in the meanings that employees attach to the organizations involved and their expectations of the new merger organization, nine month prior to the merger. A two-stage methodology was used, combining the repertory grid method with a survey questionnaire based on the elicited constructs. Predictions from a social constructionist perspective on culture and social identify theory were largely confirmed. The results showed that both groups expected one of them to be dominant after the merger. Member of this organizations expected to change very little, while employees in the non-dominant group felt themselves to be threatened by the prospect of merger and this led them to emphasize theory own distinctiveness. The findings suggest that the success of the integration process after a merger is critically dependent on how employees of mergers partners perceive the culture of the organizations involved and the expectations they have of the new organization. The study has practical implications for how to manager the merger integration process.

T1  - Using repertory grid to identify intangibles in business plans
AN  - 221918849
AB  - The assessment of intangibles in business plans by investors is an important factor of recent interest, particularly in the evaluation of early-stage technology-based ventures. On one hand, investors are challenged to properly assess new opportunities. At the same time, entrepreneurs or innovators face the formidable task of communicating what is, sometimes, nothing more than just an 'extraordinary' idea. In such situations, the decision to continue with the due diligence process, and finally to invest, is based frequently on those aspects that are intangible. In an attempt to reveal some of the intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs, an investigation was conducted using repertory grid, a technique based on personal construct psychology. Five venture capitalists and five entrepreneurs were interviewed. Evidence was found for the importance of intangibles during the investment-decision process of early stage technology-based ventures. For these ventures, the consideration of only tangible criteria is not a guaranteed predictor of success. The repertory grid technique makes a significant contribution to the identification of intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs.

T1  - Assessing attitudes toward dying and death: Psychometric considerations
AN  - 209689720
AB  - In the 50 years of research in death attitudes, clear gains have been made in the measurement of death concerns and competencies, leading to the development and validation of several scales whose more extensive use could improve the conceptual yield of research in this area. In this article, we review these promising instruments, focusing on nine general questionnaires for measuring death anxiety, fear, threat, depression, and acceptance, and four specialized measures of death self-efficacy and coping, readiness for death, and desire for hastened death. We also offer an orientation to non-questionnaire based techniques for the assessment of death attitudes (e.g., narrative measures, repertory grids, behavioral observations, death personifications and drawings), and close with a note on international developments that hold promise for improved cultural awareness of the role of death attitudes in human life.

T1  - The use of repertory grid analysis to elicit salient short-break holiday destination attributes in New Zealand
AN  - 217443448
AB  - Repertory grid analysis was developed almost 50 years ago, but its application in destination image research has been rare. The technique was used to identify 17 attributes deemed salient to New Zealanders, when differentiating domestic short-break holiday destinations. These were then compared to those attributes used in 84 previous destination studies, as well as with results from personal interviews with tourism practitioners. A number of differences between the repertory grid findings and practitioner opinion confirmed the value of seeking consumer input when developing attribute lists for use in structured surveys. While both the repertory grid findings and practitioner opinion showed a general consistency with the range of 100+ attributes used in the literature, key differences highlighted the importance of the New Zealand domestic travel context. The article attempts to demonstrate the efficacy of repertory grid, an economical technique that has been underused by tourism market researchers.

T1  - Behavioral activity associated with onset in chronic tic and habit disorder
AN  - 214424343
AB  - Seventy-six people (aged 18-62 years) diagnosed with either a chronic tic disorder or a habit disorder, entering a treatment study, kept a baseline daily diary for at least ten days, noting tic frequency and activity at time of onset. Together with an evaluator, participants completed a form ranking three high-risk activities where the tic or habit was likely to appear, and three low-risk activities where the tic was absent or barely present. Subjective appraisals distinguishing the two types of activities were also elicited and their relevance to the tic was measured on a seven-point scale using an adaptation of Kelly's repertory grid technique. Overall, the most frequent high-risk and low-risk activities were, respectively, passive attendance and physical activity. There were, however, significant differences in types of high-risk activities amongst the tic and habit disorders. Conversely, appraisals of the high-risk activities seemed to center on negative evaluations of tenseness, boredom, dissatisfaction, and disinterest.

T1  - Making the Processes of Designing Explicit Within an Information Technology Environment
AN  - 722540557
AB  - In this paper, technology is described as involving processes whereby resources are utilised to satisfy human needs or to take advantage of opportunities, to develop practical solutions to problems. This study, set within one type of technology context, information technology, investigated how, through a one semester undergraduate university course, elements of technological processes were made explicit to students. While it was acknowledged in the development and implementation of this course that students needed to learn technical skills, technological skills and knowledge, including design, were seen as vital also, to enable students to think about information technology from a perspective that was not confined and limited to `technology as hardware and software'. This paper describes how the course, set within a three year program of study, was aimed at helping students to develop their thinking and their knowledge about design processes in an explicit way. An interpretive research approach was used and data sources included a repertory grid `survey'; student interviews; video recordings of classroom interactions, audio recordings of lectures, observations of classroom interactions made by researchers; and artefacts which included students' journals and portfolios. The development of students' knowledge about design practices is discussed and reflections upon student knowledge development in conjunction with their learning experiences are made. Implications for ensuring explicitness of design practice within information technology contexts are presented, and the need to identify what constitutes design knowledge is argued.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Investigating the meaning of supplier-manufacturer partnerships: An exploratory study
AN  - 232594270
AB  - Supplier partnerships can be the key in enhancing the performance of manufacturing companies. Consequently, partnership has been strongly recommended by academics and practitioners alike. Surprisingly, the concept of partnership is only poorly understood. Many authors have identified the advantages that it can bring but far less has been published on the attributes of partnership itself. What is known is that partnerships are close relationships and thus, the level of relationship closeness is an appropriate angle for exploring supplier partnerships. Research was conducted using the repertory grid technique with an exploratory sample of ten managers from four German engineering companies. It revealed that supplier partnerships are very different from other forms of relationship and identified five distinct attributes of partnerships. These findings have a number of implications for both practitioners and researchers.

T1  - Studies on information as an asset II: repertory grid
AN  - 224648638
AB  - This article presents findings from five repertory grid interviews conducted in early 2001 to identify attributes of information as an asset. Repertory grid is a technique developed by George Kelly based on his theory of personal constructs. Personal construct theory (PCT) assumes that individuals are their own `personal scientists' who mentally represent the world around them. The method was used to enable key senior executives in information-intensive UK organizations to identify attributes of information assets considered to be significant by them for their business. The findings are not intended to be representative, but give an insight into the thinking of these key executives and their approaches to managing information assets. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Exploring teachers' instructional design practices from a systems design perspective
AN  - 740300641
AB  - Curricular changes in higher vocationaleducation have rendered teachers' instructionaldesign activities increasingly important. Usinga repertory grid technique, this paper sets outto analyse current design activities of tenteacher trainers. Their actual approach iscompared with an instructional systems design(ISD) approach and related to innovativeteacher roles. Teachers' activities show animbalance in two ID phases, that is problemanalysis and evaluation. The results suggestthat they attempt to translate curricular goalsdirectly into concrete lessons and they payrelatively little attention to evaluation. Inline with this finding, they underrate the twoinnovative teacher roles of the `diagnostician'and the `evaluator'. It is argued thatimbalanced or incomplete design approaches andperceived roles may hinder innovation ineducation. Implications for the support ofteachers' design activities are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Perceptual dimensions of performance management systems in the eyes of different sample categories
AN  - 233231044
AB  - Past appraisal perception research identify the differences in satisfaction levels towards system effectiveness. But none of them probe into the mental psyche of their respondents to uncover the true core deep-seated perceptual dimensions that influence all other constructions. This study uses the repertory grid technique to elicit personal constructs of how practicing managers experience appraisals in their own organizations. Results show that different sample categories held fundamentally different cognitions when evaluating the effectiveness of performance management systems. Implications to theory and practice are outlined.

T1  - (Rethinking) the measurement of service quality in museums and galleries
AN  - 236407147
AB  - Measurement of service quality has been instrumental in making service industries more competitive. The new era of accountability in the museum sector means that if museums and galleries are to be successful in growing visitor numbers and developing greater access, they must learn more about the factors that are important to visitors' evaluation of service quality. The aim of this study is to understand the concepts that are significant to visitors engaging in museum experiences. A repertory grid study was conducted among visitors to 11 prominent London museums; the results suggest that there is greater variety of factors influencing their decisions than is measured by traditional approaches to visitor satisfaction surveys.

T1  - Measuring brand associations for museums and galleries using repertory grid analysis
AN  - 212077349
AB  - This paper is a contribution to the literature on the branding of cultural institutions. In particular it focuses on visitor motivation in the field of museums and galleries. Measurement of visitor motivations and associated brand strength of cultural institutions is a relatively new concern for marketers. The need to develop further understanding of how best to market museums in the twenty-first century motivates this research. Repertory grid analysis was used as the survey method in order to get data that were "rich" in terms of concepts, but also malleable in terms of statistical analysis. The results of an exploratory study of museum brand associations are reported, along with a discussion of the method of repertory grid analysis that was used to obtain the data. A total of 11 museums in London were targeted, with a special focus on the Tate Gallery.

T1  - Spirituality and Cardiovascular Risk
AN  - 756930069
AB  - This study extended current research linking spirituality to health by investigating the relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic spirituality and cardiovascular risk factors. Participants included 111 healthy males and females, ages 28 to 63. Measurements consisted of the Lifestyle Assessment Questionnaire (LAQ), a version of Kelly's Repertory Grid, hematological analysis, and blood pressure. A greater sense of spirituality was associated with lower cholesterol risk ratios (total cholesterol/HDL) and triglyceride levels. In addition, the structural or organizational characteristics of intrinsic spirituality were associated with several other hematological measures. Further research will help clarify the association between mechanisms underlying spirituality and health, including susceptibility to cardiovascular disorders.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Steps Across the Border – Cooperation, Knowledge Production and Systems Design
AN  - 2259953788
AB  - The computer support of cooperation andknowledge production across sociallydistributed activity systems has become animportant topic in the context of the discourseon ``knowledge management''. The present articlewill draw on concepts of cultural-historicalactivity theory to discuss the problem of howthe notion of ``knowledge'' is conceptualized andimplicitly implemented in computer systems tosupport knowledge management, often neglectingthe social embeddedness of knowledge productionin everyday work practices. From the point ofview of cultural-historical activity theory wewould propose to look upon the generation ofknowledge as a process embedded in sociallydistributed activities that are constantlybeing reproduced and transformed in and betweenspecific communities of practice. We willpresent a model of cooperation that relatesprocessual and structural aspects of jointactivity. Methodologically, it draws on theanalysis of unexpected events in the course ofjoint activity. Our model also proposes to useforums for co-construction to make visibledifferent perspectives in the process ofsoftware design. The concept of cooperativemodel production is highlighted as a means tomediate, not to eliminate, differences ofperspectives involved in the course of systemsdesign. An empirical example will be given inwhich the repertory-grid technique is used tovisualize similarities and differences ofpotential users' viewpoints and requirements inearly stages of systems design.

T1  - The repertory grid technique: A method for the study of cognition in information systems
AN  - 218117283
AB  - Recent studies have confirmed the importance of understanding the cognition of users and information systems (IS) professionals. These works agree that organizational cognition is far too critical to be ignored as it can impact on IS outcomes. While cognition has been considered in a variety of IS contexts, no specific methodology has dominated. A theory and method suitable to the study of cognition - defined as personal constructs that individuals use to understand IT in organizations - is Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory and its cognitive mapping tool known as the repertory grid (RepGrid). This article expounds on the potential of this technique to IS researchers by considering the variety of ways the RepGrid may be employed. The flexibility of the RepGrid is illustrated by examining published studies in IS. The diagnostic qualities of the RepGrid and its mapping outcomes can be used for practical intervention at the individual and organizational levels.

T1  - Facilities management in medium-sized UK hotels
AN  - 228363501
AB  - The paper explores the application and value of facilities management concepts in medium-sized UK hotels. Using the results of recent research into the extent and context of application of facilities management in hotels, some apparent advantages of the approach are identified. Facilities management is not a term commonly applied in hotels and the paper considers its value in this field. The hotel manager is in the business of generating revenue from space. If this space is well managed, in a strategic manner, there is considerable scope for improving not only revenue, but also profit. The research uses personal construct theory and repertory grid analysis to identify the aspects of managing facilities which are perceived as important by the owners/managers themselves. A model is then developed of the suggested application of facilities management within the medium-sized hotel sector.

T1  - A two-dimensional model of cognitive empathy: An empirical study
AN  - 305585985
AB  - This study was designed to investigate the validity of a proposed theoretical model of cognitive empathy. The model consists of a circumplex with two separate constructs free to vary independently of one another, creating a contingency table: Altruism (A) on the X-Axis, measuring the ability to see similarities between self and other; and Cognitive Complexity (CC) on the Y-Axis, the capacity to see differences.    Four interpersonal relationship styles were hypothesized to result from the combination of A and CC: Cognitive Empathy—high scores on both A and CC. This is the quadrant of resonant understanding and describes the “I-Thou” relationship. Psychopathy or a less malevolent Expedience—high scores on CC but low on A, describing a contractual, contingent style characterized by the “I-You” relationship. Extremely low scores on A would indicate a more antisocial stance.  Co-Dependence—low scores on CC and high on A: a state of emotional confiscation characterized by the “I-We” relationship, without much of an “I.” Narcissism—low scores on both A and CC, suggesting an incapacity to decenter and reflect. It is characterized by an “I-It” relationship style.    A convenience sample of 344 subjects was solicited by direct mail, and obtained from two formal university subjects pools—a large state university and a large private Catholic university.    The study relied on a correlational design, augmented by hierarchical regressions and a 2 x 2 MANCOVA. To determine if the model was correct, the independent variables of Altruism (a subscale of the Helping Orientation Questionnaire) and Cognitive Complexity (measured by the 4 x 6 Repertory Grid) were examined for their relationship to the key dependent variables: Cognitive Empathy, four subscales of Co-Dependence, Primary Psychopathy, and Narcissism. Several additional measures were added to assess discriminant and convergent validity: Authoritarianism (CC); Splitting (Narcissism), Receptive Giving (Expedience); Empathic Concern (A); and seven subscales of the Love Attitudes Questionnaire. The Crowne Marlowe was added to control for social desirability; age and gender were also used as control variables.    The results of the study did not support the model as measured. Altruism appeared to measure what it purported to measure, yielding positive relationships with Empathic Concern and Perspective Taking, and negative relationships with Psychopathy, Personal Distress, and Splitting. Cognitive Complexity, on the other hand, contrary to previous studies, was positively related to Splitting and unrelated to Authoritarianism, suggesting that the 4 x 6 Repertory Grid did not measure Cognitive Complexity, a potential failure of construct validity.

T1  - Comparing managers' mental models of competition: Why self-report measures of belief similarity won't do
AN  - 222370308
AB  - In their study designed to investigate the relative impact of 'task and institutional influences on managers' mental models of competition,' Daniels et al. (2002) elicited cognitive maps using 2 complementary ideographic mapping procedures: a card-sort technique and a variant of the repertory grid. Drawing on research into the cognitive processes underpinning similarity judgments, it is argued that this approach to the comparison of cognitive maps suffers from a number of severe limitations which are likely to bias the results in favor of the research hypotheses under test, thus leading to increased type I errors.

T1  - Body experience and mental representation of body image in patients with haematological malignancies and cancer as assessed with the body grid
AN  - 218910849; 11780798
AB  - The domain of body image plays a central role in the quality of life of patients with haematological malignancies and metastasized cancer, since the disease itself as well as the enrolled therapies interfere with psychological and bodily well-being. We approached this highly subjective field by using the repertory grid technique and hypothesized that patients would display a restricted body image, focusing on functional aspects of the body. In all, 55 in-patients (27 men, 28 women, M age = 45.7 yrs, N = 46 with haematological malignancies, N = 9 with metastasized cancer), at the time of initial diagnosis, were included in the study and assessed with the Body Grid, an instrument specifically designed by us for the exploration of body image. The data were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) and construct categorization. Further, 42 chronic tinnitus sufferers (20 male, 22 female, M age = 46.5 yrs) served as a comparison group. Based on the constructs elicited, six construct categories were formulated in the sense of a first attempt of a hierarchical model (emotion, control, activity, strength, function, appearance). The central constructs (373 construct pairs) were assigned to these categories by three inter-raters. The categories appeared in the following order of frequency: function (27.1%), emotion (20.4%), strength (20.1%), activity (15%), control (10.2%) and appearance (7.2%). PCA indicated that the patients mainly demonstrated a restricted view of their body. In the tinnitus group, the most frequent category proved to be activity (21.3%), closely followed by function (21.1%) and control (20.9%). The body image was also restricted (PCA). The restriction of body image, together with the specific construct choice, seen in the haematology and cancer patients reflects the existential threat of the disease and may serve as a coping strategy. The high percentage of emotional constructs may mirror the patients' need for further support. The distinct distribution of construct categories in the two different patient samples supports the applicability of the proposed preliminary model.

T1  - Priority setting in agricultural research: beyond economic surplus methods
AN  - 216173795
AB  - This article examines the issue of priority setting in Third World agricultural research organizations, for those research sectors and topics which - mainly because of the difficulty of quantifying benefits - are outside the domain of economic surplus and benefit/cost techniques. The issue is redefined as one of processing ill-structured decisions, i.e., decisions in which there is no unique, identifiable, objectively optimal solution. The implications of this for the concept of rational action in this field are explored, and the results used to define a practical approach. This centres on a radical review of the possible options and criteria in priority setting, using four techniques (challenge groups, repertory grid, creativity techniques and flow charting). The final section of the article examines the decision-making aspects of these techniques in three priority-setting contexts of increasing difficulty: within a department, where the issue is essentially one of technical choice between competing research lines; within a major institute or research sector, where there is substantial competition for resources; and in an institute or sector which is facing a crisis of resources or relevance.

T1  - Personal constructs, childhood sexual abuse and revictimization
AN  - 218937939; 11589329
AB  - Within the theoretical framework of Ryle's Procedural Sequence Object Relations Model and Kelly's Personal Construct Theory, this study investigates sex-role polarization of incest survivors and the centrality of abuse within survivors' constructs of men that may contribute to revictimization. Repertory grid methodology was used with 40 female survivors of childhood sexual abuse and 28 non-abused women. Grid measures and psychometric measures were compared between groups of women who had and had not experienced childhood sexual abuse, revictimized and non-revictimized survivors, and survivors who had and had not experienced incestuous abuse. Results showed significant differences between survivors and non-abused women, with survivors having higher levels of depression and perceived distress, lower self-esteem and higher self/ ideal self discrepancy. Hypothesized differences in sex-role polarization were not found. There were few differences between revictimized and non-revictimized survivors, although revictimized survivors rated 'self now' as more powerful than non-revictimized survivors. No differences were found between survivors who had and had not experienced incestuous abuse. In addition to the value of exploring personal constructs, a range of models need to be considered in understanding revictimization and women's construal of men. The implications of using repertory grid methodology for research and clinical work are discussed.

T1  - Analysis of repertory grids in clinical practice
AN  - 218680538; 11593952
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper illustrates the use of several different forms of analysis of repertory grid data, using a case study of a client who completed repertory grids at various stages of therapy. METHOD: Participants in a survivors' group completed grids before and after therapy and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Grids from one of the participants, who had been sexually abused as a child, are presented using different levels of analysis: visual inspection of the raw grid; analysis of dissimilarities between pairs of elements or constructs; hierarchical cluster analysis of elements and constructs both separately and combined; principal components analysis; biplot representation of elements and constructs combined; multidimensional scaling analysis and unfolding analysis. The latter two methods also provide ways of presenting a combined analysis of a number of grids. Computer packages are reviewed, and SYSTAT commands are presented to perform the analyses. RESULTS: The review of methods illustrates how different levels of analysis can usefully back up clients' own accounts of progress through therapy, from detailed analysis of individual ratings in the raw grid, through analyses that pull out structural patterns at the expense of detail, to the broad sweep provided by methods that combine data from a number of grids. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of repertory grids completed at various stages of therapy can provide useful qualitative information on progress, but can also provide some simple quantitative measures (such as Self-Ideal Self discrepancy as a measure of self esteem) to track progress. Different forms of analysis can be informative, highlighting different aspects of progress, but also allowing checks on adequacy and goodness-of-fit of particular analyses.

T1  - Understanding patients' preferences for treatment: the need for innovative methodologies
AN  - 1778769946
AB  - Treatment selection is now much more consumer driven than in the past. However, there is a need to develop investigative methodological approaches that are sensitive to differences in patient preferences if full account is to be taken of what the patient sees as the best option in terms of different possible treatments available for a particular condition. Previous attitude research has been criticised because it does not provide insight into reasons why people hold different preferences or beliefs. A methodology is described which allows people to describe their concerns and values associated with different treatment options in their own words. This is the repertory grid method of eliciting personal constructs used in conjunction with generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA). An example of the use of this methodology is provided, drawn from research directed towards understanding people's beliefs about genetic technologies. A possible application of the method to understanding treatment preferences related to type 2 diabetes is also discussed. It is concluded that the use of innovative methodologies is essential if our understanding of patient preferences regarding treatment options is to have a significant impact on patient quality of life.

T1  - Assessment of the effects of user characteristics on mental models of information retrieval systems
AN  - 231524512
AB  - This article reports the results of a study that investigated effects of four user characteristics on users' mental models of information retrieval systems: educational and professional status, first language, academic background, and computer experience. The repertory grid technique was used in the study. Using this method, important components of information retrieval systems were represented by nine concepts, based on four IR experts' judgments. Users' mental models were represented by factor scores that were derived from users' matrices of concept ratings on different attributes of the concepts. The study found that educational and professional status, academic background, and computer experience had significant effects in differentiating users on their factor scores. First language had a borderline effect, but the effect was not significant.

T1  - Toward an expert assessment of intangibles in technology-based new ventures
AN  - 304783440
AB  - This dissertation documents three initial phases of an investigation into intangible aspects of new ventures. The assessment of intangibles, which are often present in startups, is a topic of recent interest (Stewart 1997, Clement, Hammerer and Schwarz 1998, Shepherd and Douglas 1999, Sullivan 1999, Smart 1999, Boulton et al 2000), particularly during the early-stage investment-decision process of technology-based ventures. On one hand, investors are challenged to properly assess new opportunities. At the same time, entrepreneurs or innovators face the formidable task of communicating what is, sometimes, nothing more than just an “extraordinary” idea. In such situations, the decision to continue with the due diligence process, and finally to invest, is based frequently on those aspects that are intangible.    Phase I of the research was a pilot study to elicit vocabulary from investors and determine their need to assess intangibles. A group of twelve investment-decision experts were interviewed. The interviews were content analysed. The results of the content analysis suggest that there is a need on the part of both investors and entrepreneurs to improve their assessment of intangibles when making an investment decision.    Phase II used Repertory Grid, a technique based on personal construct psychology, to identify intangibles used by experts when assessing or communicating new venture opportunities. Five venture capitalists and five entrepreneurs were interviewed. The results reveal a total of 149 constructs. Principal component analyses indicate that each interviewee identified only a few major areas of emphasis in his or her thinking. Furthermore, a cluster analysis revealed that each investor had his or her own way of conceiving the intangibles in a given proposal. Next, an extremity analysis identified each person's most meaningful constructs. As a result of these analyses, the operation of intangibles during the investment-decision process is evident. From this phase, what is remarkable is the contribution of Repertory Grid technique to identify intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs.    Phase III involved the development of a fuzzy expert system as a diagnostic tool to assess intangibles in new technology-based ventures. The system was validated with five experts in investment-decision making. The results show a promising future of this tool when used for assisting entrepreneurs and investors to assess venture viability. Finally, the results of this research could also open the door for this technique to be applied in other areas such as: scientific proposals, requisition of grants, and assessment of employment candidates.

T1  - Researching discrimination in selection for international management assignments: The role of repertory grid technique
AN  - 213154959
AB  - Extensive literature exists into discrimination in selection in the fields of psychology, social psychology and sociology. This research focuses mainly on domestic appointments and does not consider the nature of selection for international appointments. Discusses the findings of a study into potential gender bias in international manager selection systems. In particular, it discusses the use of repertory grid technique to elicit the personal constructs of selectors for international appointments and to assess how these might influence the numbers of women entering international management positions.

T1  - How do directors of public health perceive leadership?
AN  - 197359138
AB  - This study examines how directors of public health (DsPH) perceive effective leadership. Kelly's (1955) repertory grid technique is used. A total of 13 out of a possible 14 DsPH in one NHS region of England were interviewed. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were carried out. The findings show that male DsPH rate their leadership ability more highly than do female DsPH. Qualitative analysis produced a number of categories of constructs, some of which are perceived to be indicative of effective leadership, these being working for others, personal attributes, vision and innovation, and courage and integrity. Some categories appear to be applicable only to the UK (or to public health) and not to the existing dominant US models of leadership. In general, DsPH perceptions of effective leadership converge with current theories; most specifically the UK-based theories. This study therefore refutes any simple extrapolation of US theories of leadership to UK health organizations.

T1  - Perceived applicant fit: Distinguishing between recruiters' perceptions of person-job and person-organization fit
AN  - 220143471
AB  - There were 2 studies conducted to assess whether recruiters form distinguishable perceptions of applicant person-job (P-J) and person-organization (P-O) fit. The first study used repertory grid methodology with actual recruiters and mock applicants to demonstrate that knowledge, skills, and abilities are relied on more frequently to assess P-J fit, and values and personality traits more often to assess P-O fit. Study 2, which involved actual recruiters making decisions on applicants in a field setting, supported P-J and P-O fit perceptions as 2 discernable factors. Study 2 also found that both types of perceived fit offer unique prediction of hiring recommendations. Taken together, these results present compelling evidence that recruiters discriminate between applicants' P-J and P-O fit during early interviews.

T1  - A Study of the Perceptions of the Labour Market by Human Resource Managers in the UK Hotel Industry: A Cognitive Approach
AN  - 1972081260
AB  - It is reasonable to assume that if the labour market is the dominant force in labour management then the significance of the role of the human resource manager lies in the position it holds at the intersection between the external and the internal market, with recruitment as the joining process. This paper describes a qualitative investigation of hotel human resource managers' perceptions of their labour market environment using the process of recruitment as a vehicle to explore cognitive processes. A cognitive task analysis was completed which utilised four interview methods: task diagram; knowledge audit; simulation interview; and repertory grid. The findings show that the HR managers conform to the appellation of 'expert' in that they would use few and simple rules in making decisions. They also assume that the labour market will always provide and that perceptions of what goes on inside the organisation are quite separate. In other words there is both an industry and in organisational perspective at work.

T1  - Religious commitment and the construal of sources of help for emotional problems
AN  - 218915027; 11003370
AB  - Religious commitment as an influence upon seeking help for psychological problems has not received the same level of research attention as variables such as sex, ethnicity and cultural background. The construing of members of a group of committed UK Christians was investigated, regarding their receiving such help from a variety of different helpers, professional and non-professional, secular and spiritual. Each participant was asked to interpret the factors statistically identified from construct and element relationships in a repertory grid that they had completed. Their commentaries formed the data for a qualitative thematic analysis, which gave rise to four main themes. From these, a tentative model is discussed. Possible implications for the acceptance of service provision by the substantial minority groups of religiously committed people in the UK are considered in the light of this model--and in the light of the further research that would be needed to establish it.

However, repertory grids possess great potential in the field of tourism research. As opposed to methods commonly used in studies of image, the repertory grid approach is couched in well-tested psychological theory and avoids bias inherent in alternative methods due to prespecification of study attributes.

T1  - Repertory grid technique - An interpretive research framework
AN  - 237021142
AB  - A study examines some of the underlying assumptions, research objectives and practical applications of the repertory grid technique (RGT) in consumer research. It explains why the use and evaluation of the RGT should be grounded in the assumptions of the theory from which it derives, George Kelly's personal construct psychology (PCP), and examines the way in which it is both congruent with and can contribute to the development of the emerging interpretive paradigm in consumer research. The specific questions that the RGT can help to answer about consumer behaviour experience are identified and illustrated with the findings from a short empirical study. Overall, it is argued that when the RGT is employed within the guidelines of PCP it provides a useful interpretive research framework for exploring some of the similarities and differences in the content and structure of consumers' subjective meaning systems.

T1  - Exploring consumer product construct systems with the repertory grid technique
AN  - 213434911
AB  - Over the last 25 years the repertory grid technique (RGT) has been widely employed as a qualitative method in market research. Originally developed by George Kelly (1955) to explore the subjective meanings that people attach to their world, the RGT has particularly been adopted in consumer research for examining consumers' perceptions of products and services, most notably in means-end chain analysis. Despite its relative widespread use, however, the full potential of the RGT as a qualitative method has yet to be realised, either in market research in general or consumer research in particular, for a number of reasons.  The aim of this paper is to show how the RGT and theory can be employed in market research as a qualitative method for exploring the nature and form of the network of subjective meanings that consumers attach to their consumption experiences, what are termed here consumers' product construct systems (PCSs).

T1  - The personal construction of information space
AN  - 231492668
AB  - This article describes the use of Repertory Grid methodology as a means of externalizing an individual's view of information space. The method is described with a single participant, and appears to offer a viable means of exploring the concept of information space. Future work will examine multiple views in an attempt to explore the extent to which the concept is shared among a group of people.

T1  - Personal constructs of male survivors of childhood sexual abuse receiving cognitive analytic therapy
AN  - 218934262; 10874477
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed whether male survivors of sexual abuse identified with their abusers rather than their child- or victim-selves and failed to identify with men in general or with their victims, following abusive 'acting out'. Changes in both identification and symptomatology were assessed following cognitive analytic therapy. DESIGN: A patient series within-participants design was used. METHOD: A repertory grid methodology examined four male survivors self-construals before and after therapy. Measures of symptomatic distress, depression, self-esteem and distorted beliefs related to childhood sexual abuse were also obtained. RESULTS: Before therapy, patients showed little identification with the child-selves, men in general and ideal-selves. Two heterosexual patients identified with their abuser(s) whereas another, homosexual, patient negatively identified with his abuser. Patients did not identify with their victims following aggressive 'acting out'. After therapy, identification with the abuser reduced markedly; identification with victim- and ideal-self increased. Depression and distorted beliefs declined. CONCLUSION: Male survivors tend to identify with abusers and disavow their victim-hood. Sexual orientation may predict identification patterns. Cognitive analytic therapy may be a promising method of enabling survivors to integrate their abuse experience and reduce their commitment to the abuser role.

AN  - 214810388
AB  - This study describes case studies of 3 organizations, exploring the role of organizational culture as a framework for the inclusion and exclusion of actual and potential organizational members. To explore common understandings of culture, methods included: 1. repertory grid, 2. group discussions, 3. documentary evidence, 4. discussion with informants, and 5. observation and reflection by the author. Both the culture-as-variable and culture-as-metaphor perspectives are used respectively to analyze and interpret the data. A number of processes were found significant in the promotion or otherwise of diversity. Significant symbols in each organization are explored, and theoretical and practical implications are discussed in relation to managing diversity.

T1  - Manufacturing change The role of performance evaluation and control systems
AN  - 232350894
AB  - This paper reports on research currently being undertaken into change in performance evaluation and control systems. Case study research involving the use of repertory grids, in-depth interviews, and observation has been undertaken to examine the impact of these systems on behavior and the potentially problematic nature of change in performance evaluation and control systems. This contrasts with previous research which has often assumed that such systems can be treated almost as easily manipulable independent variables. The case study illustrates the ways in which performance evaluation and control systems provide a formative context which means that change can be difficult to achieve and requires an understanding of the cultural assumptions underpinning both current and desired systems.

T1  - PE teachers teach the way they were taught: asset or handicap?
AN  - 214330614
AB  - The repertory grid shows how closely number patterns for effective and ineffective teachers are related. In conversation, student teachers are invited to describe similarities and differences between these teachers from a variety of different teaching/coaching contexts. From over seventy such interviews currently conducted, the majority of responses from PE student teachers have focused on effective coaches from their past-coaches who were instrumental in their success as athletes. Occasionally, PE teachers or other teachers from student teachers' pasts come up as model teachers. It is these teachers, rather than the coaches, that offer the framework to understand the principles and concepts of effective teaching in PE. The coaches, though inspirational in a particular sport, rarely offer the strategies for teaching that transfer into effective PE teaching.

T1  - The personal construction of death in anorexia nervosa
AN  - 218898922; 20220800
AB  - This paper reports a study concerned with an attempt to understand the manner in which individuals at high objective risk of death through their own behaviour, understand the phenomenon of death, and their own death. It is an extension of an earlier empirical study (Warren et al., 1994) which in turn, set out to test a hypothesis advanced by Jackson and Davidson (1986) that disturbed death ideation was aetiologically significant in anorexia nervosa; and an extension of earlier work on death constructions, and death education (Warren, 1984, 1989). Constructs were elicited from a sample of hospitalized sufferers of anorexia nervosa. These participants also completed the provided construct, Death Threat Index. Repertory grids were analysed for the information they yield concerning death constructions in sufferers of anorexia nervosa. Various quantitative measures were also derived and compared with similar measures from a control group.

The need to conduct cross-cultural research is perhaps even more important in the relatively newly emerging and quickly changing information systems (IS) field. This article presents issues relating to qualitative research, emic versus etic approaches, and describes a structured, yet flexible, qualitative research interviewing technique, which decreases the potential for bias on the part of the researcher.

T1  - The meaning of mothers' and nurses' interactions during a child's hospitalization
AN  - 304631259
AB  - When a child becomes acutely ill and requires hospitalization, there is mounting evidence that parents' relationships with professionals are one of the key factors that result in outcomes such as anxiety, frustration, conflict, stress, mistrust and dissatisfaction (Dixon, 1996; Jarrett, 1996; Knafl & Dixon, 1984; Tiedeman, 1997). The purpose of this study is to understand how mothers perceive and attribute meaning to their interactions with nurses in the hospital setting, and to examine nurses' perspectives towards parents that impact on their interactions with parents in this setting. Personal Construct Theory (PCT)(Kelly, 1955) and the accompanying repertory grid technique was used to examine the personal constructs through which mothers and nurses viewed, interpreted, and thereby gave meaning to their interactions in the hospital setting. Twenty mothers and 20 nurses completed repertory technique rating grids, a brief qualitative questionnaire and a demographic instrument during the acute, unexpected hospitalization of their child (ages 3months to 12 years). Results indicate that the meaning mothers attribute to their interactions is primarily influenced by their evaluation of the nurse. Mothers' evaluation of their interactions with nurses (either effective or ineffective) influenced their ability to participate in their child's hospitalization and their decision to do so either actively or passively. Similarly, nurses' interactions were influenced by their evaluation of mothers. Nurses classified mothers as either “difficult” or “ideal” based on whether they felt valued and listened to by the parent. Ideal parents were those who were perceived to listen carefully and follow the nurse's directions. Difficult parents were those who were perceived to not comply with nurses' expectations, to which nurses responded with rigid and controlling approaches to these parents. Group analyses revealed that mothers valued nurses who were able to convey a sense of trust and respect towards them and convey a sense of equality in their relationship with them. In contrast, communication with parents, and control over the parents and the child's care were the most pervasive and consistent themes in the meaning systems of the nurses, yet how these themes were viewed and interpreted varied according to complexity and according to specific people and situations.

T1  - Strategic groups and cognitive groups: Theoretical comparison and empirical analysis in the homebuilding industry
AN  - 250290835
AB  - Strategic group is a group of firms in an industry that follow the same or a similar strategy. This concept has been widely used for researchers as an intermediate tool between the analysis of the industry as a whole and the individual analysis of competing firms. Its main use is a tool to help managers cope with their bounded rationality and reduce uncertainty. What this thesis tries to answer is whether these researcher-defined groupings are really relevant for the strategy-making process and whether they correspond with managers personal taxonomies of competitors.    To do so, we analyze the Homebuilding Industry in a small town developing two parallel empirical studies. First, we identify the strategic groups that integrate that industry following the traditional economic-approach—cluster analyses. Moreover, using repertory grid technique, we analyze managers' mental models in order to obtain their personal taxonomies of competitors. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that both categorization of competitors, research-defined and manager defined are convergent, suggesting a direct and indirect causation between them.    The dissertation is organized as follows: In the first chapter we justify the Thesis and show our objectives and hypothesis to be contrasted. The second chapter makes a literature review on strategic groups. The third chapter does the same review on cognitive groups literature. In the fourth chapter we present an integrative model that compares the Positioning School—strategic groups—with the Cognitive School cognitive groups. The fifth chapter shows the results of the first empirical analysis carried out on the Homebuilding Industry. The sixth chapter presents the managers' vision of their industry. The seventh chapter compares both classifications of competitors. The eight chapter presents the conclusions and implications of the findings for academics and managers.

T1  - Characteristics of well-performing organisations in Singapore
AN  - 226850629
AB  - Very little is known about the characteristics of successful organizations which are located in the East. This paper seeks to add to this limited knowledge and, in so doing, uses 6 of Singapore's most successful companies as its sample. The repertory grid technique is used to analyze case studies relating to each of the 6 companies and appropriate concepts are developed. The results suggest that the 6 selected companies have become successful as a result of: 1. being customer oriented, 2. creating new products to enter existing markets, 3. having a clear vision and direction, 4. offering career training, and 5. having a disciplined informal professional atmosphere. Some of these characteristics may seem, on the surface, to be similar to those identified in Western organizations. Indeed, such values might be useful in interpreting the way that different organizations illustrate the 5 identified characteristics.

T1  - Theoretical papers: Effective leadership within hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Units
AN  - 197380563
AB  - In this study the Repertory Grid interview technique was used to investigate constructs of leadership held by a group of male and female senior managers from within hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Units (SPCUs) in the UK. The themes that emerged were compared with those from existing research models of leadership. Results: men and women in these roles describe different constructs of effective leadership. The women's constructs that emerged were predominantly transformational, while the men's were predominantly transactional Themes were also identified in this study, which differed from previous studies, i.e. those of political and environment awareness and the valuing of others' views regardless of their status. These themes do not feature highly in other research, and may be in response to the environment within which hospice and specialist palliative care functions.

T1  - Strategic investment decision-making: Managerial judgement on project risk and return
AN  - 1031187045
AB  - Until recently little attention has been given in Accounting and Finance literature to the problem of linking the results of financial evaluation techniques such as Net Present Value (NPV) and Shareholder Value Analysis (SVA) to managers' cognitive evaluation of strategic factors and the risk profile of projects.  Various authors have called for research in this area, but very little has so far been published.  This paper reports on a field-based study carried out in the logistics industry. It builds on earlier research, which elicited constructs that managers use to assess project risk using a repertory grid technique.   It provides an insight into how a project risk analysis process can be linked with project returns in strategic investment appraisal (SIA) in a divisionalised organisation. An action research approach was taken to develop a decision matrix to link the risk assessment results to expected project returns as an aid to management in strategic investment decision-making. It is now embedded in the investment appraisal procedures across the European group of companies that participated in the research. It is suggested that the framework adopted in this experimental study is transferable to other organisational contexts.

T1  - Towards a relational self: Social engagement during pregnancy and psychological preparation for motherhood
AN  - 219218128; 10641295; 20106049
AB  - This study works towards a theoretical model of the relational self derived from the intensive examination of a small number of case studies of women going through their first pregnancy. The study is idiographic, grounded in the women's own accounts of the experience, and it is primarily qualitative. It employs interviews, diaries, repertory grids and interpretative phenomenological analysis. The theory argues that pregnancy can accentuate the symbiotic relation of one's perception of self and others, and that this aids psychological preparation for mothering. Increasing contact with key others can be psychologically informative: the woman may perceive herself as becoming more like key other(s); close involvement with existing family can facilitate the woman's preparation for taking on the new role of mother. The model is explicated with illustrations from the women's accounts. It is then discussed in relation to the existing literature.

T1  - Project risk assessment: A European field study
AN  - 204773608; 00740386
AB  - A field-based study was carried out in the logistics industry, which followed an innovative action research approach, operationalized by the use of focus groups and repertory grids.  Using a repertory grid technique, constructs were elicited, which managers used to explain the riskiness of a particular project, compared to other projects of a similar type that they had knowledge of from past investment appraisals.  The results include a set of 12 project risk attributes, a project typology which defines 3 types of projects, each with a set of weightings reflecting the relative importance of the attributes to the participants.  These provide a useful insight into managers' perceptions of the risk attached to strategic investment projects in a large European group.  In addition to the context-specific results, conclusions are drawn regarding the use of repertory grids as a framework for a risk assessment technique in other organizational settings.

T1  - The changing management agenda for primary heads
AN  - 234392526
AB  - There has been unprecedented change in education in the last decade since the 1988 Education Reform Act (ERA), and there is little doubt that these changes in education are causing profound shifts in the nature of the headteacher's role. This paper investigates the role of the primary headteacher and is based on empirical evidence from experienced primary headteachers, all working in schools in one of the South Wales Valleys. There are three qualitative methods used to gather data: participant observation, interviews and Repertory Grids. The results from the empirical data reveal many changes in the role of the primary head; the most significant of the changes is an increase in management activities. The changes do not support the view that an increase in management leads to a deprofessionalisation; the core values of the primary head remain rooted in their philosophies of education. The results support the view that there is a changing management agenda, a new professional emerging, a New Public Management where the head manages but retains the core education sector values and visions.

T1  - Using qualitative research to establish SME support needs

AB  - SMEs are both users of marketing research and subjects of market research. There is clear evidence that the decision processes in such firms often render the products/services designed for medium and large firms in appropriate. One of the major suppliers of services to the small firms sector is the business support infrastructure. This includes agencies associated with business start-up/expansion and their management consultancy services concerning marketing, finance, insurance, and risk management. This paper considers the value of using in-depth qualitative research to establish the unique features of business support required by small firms. In addition to a review of recent studies that have adopted ethnographic, repertory grid and cognitive mapping qualitative approaches in this context, the paper presents the results from a specific study where the repertory grid procedure was used to establish the risk management practices of high technology firms.

AB  - A model is presented for analyzing the subcontractor's risk elements in construction refurbishment projects.  The system is based on the use of fuzzy set theory with the fuzzy set representing the overall weighted average rating of refurbishment contractors criterion for the selection of subcontractors.  A prototype knowledge based expert system is described, which provides a systematic and objective approach to the selection of subcontractors.  Knowledge elicitation methodology using the repertory grid technique is detailed.  The implementation of a subcontractor selection and appointment model for refurbishment contractors in linguistic terms allows the user to interact with the system in a very friendly manner using natural language expressions.

T1  - Evaluating business information systems fit: From concept to practical application
AN  - 218775279; 01788846
AB  - Attempting to explain information systems success and failure is a complex task. To measure it is perhaps more complex and compounded by difficulties related to the concept of measurement in a social context. The prevalent approach taken to date revolves around the concept of 'fit', as defined by the contingency approach in organizational theory. In reviewing this, a proposal is made for an interpretive approach to measurement. This paper attempts to provide such an approach through the development of a framework that aims to improve understanding for the researcher and practitioner alike. The formative part of the framework seeks to collect data relating to the fit of the information system and its environment along the dimensions of decision making, innovation and information acquisition and distribution. The latter part of the framework uses repertory grids to gain an understanding of both what is perceived as wrong with the system and what is perceived as wanted from the system; the latter acting as a basis for corrective action.

T1  - Repressive coping and self-reports of parenting
AN  - 218652809; 10212738
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether women who possess a repressive coping style (repressors) self-report more positive judgments of their childhood on questionnaire and repertory grid measures compared with non-repressors. DESIGN: Repressors (low anxiety-high defensiveness) were compared with a composite group of non-repressors, containing some low anxious (low anxiety-low defensiveness), some high anxious (high anxiety-low defensiveness), some defensive high anxious (high anxiety-high defensiveness) and some non-extreme scorers. METHODS: Participants completed the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI; Parker, Tupling & Brown, 1979) and a 10 x 10 repertory grid, Self-Identification Form. RESULTS: On the PBI, repressors scored significantly higher than non-repressors on paternal care and significantly lower on paternal overprotection. There were no group differences for maternal measures. On the repertory grid, repressors compared with non-repressors perceived (a) themselves as significantly closer to their father, a woman they like, and their ideal partner, and significantly further from a woman they dislike, and a man they dislike; and (b) their father as significantly closer to a woman they like, a partner/person they admire, and an ideal partner. In addition, repressors were significantly tighter on construing than non-repressors. CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the hypothesis that repressors would rate their interactions with their fathers more positively than non-repressors when allowed to do so on self-report measures.

T1  - Organizational change schemas: An empirical investigation of how health care managers make sense of organizational change
AN  - 304514130
AB  - This research examined the structural properties of individual’s organizational change schemas. An organizational change schema is a particular sensemaking framework that contains knowledge about organizational change, including change attributes and relations among those attributes. Understanding the properties of these schemas is important because existing research suggests that the way individuals think about change influences their responses to it.    Specifically, the present study investigated health care managers’ sensemaking regarding implementation of a quality initiative by examining: (1) the structure and content of organizational change schemas; (2) the extent to which schemas were shared by organizational members; and (3) the nature of the relationship between shared understanding and organizational inertia.    A sample of 28 health care managers from a large hospital in the Northeastern U.S. completed the repertory grid, a method originating in cognitive psychology (Kelly, 1955). This method allowed organizational members to identify meaningful dimensions that distinguished between organizational change attributes while minimizing the imposition of the researcher’s frame of reference. The content and structure of members’ change schemas were also examined using a pre-designed instrument by Lau and Woodman (1995).    Content analysis revealed that in their effort to make sense of organizational change, organizational members rely on a relatively small number of widely shared evaluative dimensions, and a larger number of essentially idiosyncratic dimensions. An analysis of change schemas by organizational level revealed important differences in the way top managers and middle managers make sense of change. The results of cluster analysis indicated that discrete shared organizational change schemas could be identified and meaningfully understood in terms of current and ideal orientations. Contrary to expectations, incongruence between members’ current and ideal change schemas did not give rise to negative emotions. However, incongruence between these schemas was positively related to resistance to change. Comparison of the two methods used in this study suggests that the preservation of the terms and dimensions people themselves use to describe organizational change represents an important consideration for future cognitive-based organizational change research. Implications for theory and practice as well as directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - A commentary by Chinese hotel workers on the value of vocational education
AN  - 215392374
AB  - The open-door policy started by the late Deng Xiao Ping has not only been maintained since his death but under the new Chinese leadership it has been encouraged even further. Because of this China has seen an unprecedented number of tourist arrivals which in turn has led to an explosion in the construction of hotels. However, due to poor vocational educational facilities and staff for hospitality subjects there is a dearth of qualified hotel operatives. A study examines Chinese hotel employees' perceptions of various elements of vocational education associated with the Chinese hotel industry. This was done by asking staff to rank their feelings on a bipolar scale and the results examined using Kelly's Repertory Grid principal components analysis.

T1  - Gendered career paths
AN  - 214802978
AB  - Starting from the viewpoint that career is a gender concept, the author suggests that organizational culture is a key determinant in relation to career paths, fostering success for men, and difficulty for women. Four case study organizations were investigated using repertory grid interviews with men and women managers, group discussions, and documentary evidence. In each case the organizational background, and traditional and current career paths are described, with comments on the extend to which these could be negotiated by women. Respondents outlined what is valued in managers in terms of characteristics and behavior in their respective organizations. All these aspects are linked to the key assumptions underlying each organizational culture. In 3 out of the 4 organizations women faced serious difficulties. Only in NHS Trust with a female chief executive was there close congruity between culture and style, and career paths open to all.

T1  - Expectations of an exercise prescription scheme: An exploratory study using repertory grids
AN  - 2126529876
AB  - Objectives. The study aimed to investigate in depth the personal constructs relating to exercise of individuals referred by their medical practitioner for a 10‐week gym‐based exercise programme. It further aimed to study the expectations of change on these constructs and the extent to which these predicted adherence. A subsidiary aim was to evaluate the usefulness of repertory grid methodology in the exercise context.Design. This was a longitudinal study.Methods. Participants were interviewed at the start of the 10‐week exercise programme. During the interview they completed repertory grids designed to elicit constructs about exercise‐related change. Participants were followed up at three months to check adherence.Results. Three illustrative individual case studies are presented in detail followed by some aggregated analyses. These suggest that expectations of change were very diverse and often overoptimistic. Those who completed their course of exercise had more modest expectations of change than those who failed to complete. They also showed less gulf between their current view of themselves and their view of themselves as they would like to be.Conclusions. The study suggests that having realistic aims and understanding of the outcomes that can be expected from a brief exercise programme is an important predictor of success, but one that may currently be overlooked in the enthusiasm to implement exercise prescription schemes.

T1  - Primary and secondary store-loyal customer perceptions of grocery retailers
AN  - 225143323
AB  - Gaining competitive advantage in retailing requires knowledge of the attributes consumers use to evaluate stores and an understanding of why these attributes are important. Although a number of store-image studies have identified store attributes, evidence suggests that these attributes vary by store type and over time, but no work has considered the most crucial aspects to retailers, namely store loyalty. As no study has examined the links between store attributes and store loyalty, the knowledge remains largely speculative. This article explores this link using Kelly's repertory grid methodology to assess the store images of three UK grocery retailers. Important differences were seen between primary store-loyal customers' perception of their store and secondary store-loyal customers' perception of that store. Implications for retail positioning strategies and the development of store loyalty are discussed.

AB  - School guidance focus: a Hong Kong Study
As schools worldwide pay more attention to pastoral care and pupil guidance research into guidance focus as a school factor and ways of assessing it are still undeveloped. The study reported here aimed at identifying the guidance focus (remedial, preventive or developmental) adopted in Hong Kong secondary schools. In the absence of previous studies, it was necessary to establish criteria of identification. Constructs of guidance were first identified using Kelly's Repertory Grid. This was followed by a questionnaire survey of guidance practices. The findings indicated that case work and developmental group work were useful indicators. The criteria established for assessing schools' guidance focus were the amount of time spent by the school guidance team and the priority they assigned to each indicator. The findings also revealed conceptual and methodological problems in determining school guidance focus and in categorising schools accordingly, thus opening up other areas of research. While specific to Hong Kong secondary schools, the method is reported for its relevance to other school settings.

T1  - An exploration of students' personal constructs: Implications for clinical teaching in psychiatric mental health nursing
AN  - 304422586
AB  - Despite revolutionary rhetoric in the nursing education literature calling for collaborative student centered learning, few opportunities actually exist, particularly in the psychiatric clinical teaching area, to include the voices of student nurses in the scholarly dialogue surrounding their learning. This thesis was designed to understand students' own ways of knowing during their six-week mental health practicums on acute hospital units. A constructivist conceptual perspective and George Kelly's personal construct psychology are the theoretical bases of the research. Qualitative methodology using the case study approach was used to describe the experiences of six Canadian second year nursing students from their own perspectives. Data sources included before and after repertory grids, a questionnaire and audiotape-recorded transcribed interviews. Content was theme analyzed, Vee Heuristic diagramed and concept mapped. The case studies were written collaboratively with students and member checking by correspondence six months after the practicum ended confirmed that the reports authentically narrated the personal construct changes which occurred, or did not occur, as a result of the course. The study spanned three years, included a pilot project and incorporated the resulting student "stories" into a clinical curriculum. The case reports are snapshot portrayals of how student nurses construed the professional activities they observed on hospital units which recently underwent organizational changes. They reflect human faces behind the paradigm shifts occurring in nursing education and health care. The following four overarching themes represent key findings. The research approach invited constructivist teaching. Students' anxiety related more to feeling unable to help than to mentally ill patients. Students felt a lack of inclusion in staff nurse groups. Non evaluated student-instructor discussion time was vitally important. Suggestions for clinical teaching strategies are made to assist instructors in the selection of experiences which can help link university curricula to hospital practicum sites. The research contributes to the conceptualization of how students learn nursing by re-valuing what they bring to clinical experiences, by increasing understanding of what students find engaging or difficult and by developing a pedagogical mode of inquiry which extends clinical instruction beyond demonstration and evaluation to creating a space for student perceptions.

T1  - Perceptions of software quality: a pilot study
AN  - 235083944
AB  - Many software quality initiatives fail because they do not take account of the range of views that people have of quality. New approaches to software quality improvement will not work unless software developers believe in them, no matter how enthusiastic managers may be. This paper reports on a pilot study using the repertory grid technique that found evidence to support these assertions. The study findings justify further work and show that while the repertory grid technique is an appropriate instrument in this area it is resource intensive to apply and may not be practical in a wider study of a representative sample of the IT industry. The paper has practical recommendations for successful introduction of new software quality programmes. These recommendations stress the need for effective communication, leading to a shared understanding of 'quality', and for realistic goals that recognize the pressure of development schedules.

T1  - How Tutors Model Students: A Study of Personal Constructs in Adaptive Tutoring
AN  - 1986936326
AB  - Studies of tutoring are producing rich descriptions of tutorial dialogue but have not                identified constructs that tutors use to classify and discriminate among students for                the purpose of adapting tutoring to student differences. This study investigated five                experienced tutors' personal constructs about students tutored over a significant                period of time. Several tutoring settings and domains were represented. Constructs                used by tutors to discriminate among tutees were identified with repertory grid                interviews and interpreted with the aid of cluster analysis. All tutors judged and                classified students in terms of two underlying dimensions that were similarly                defined, though not exactly alike, across tutors: motivation and intellectual                ability. Tutors' personal constructs and tutorial decisions informed by those                constructs are reported, and implications for programming computer-based tutors are                discussed.

AB  - Psychologist Valerie Stewart and engineer John Mayes spent the last five years designing and developing the software, which is also seen as a valuable tool in business management and decision-making.

              
   While there is no "correct" map, analysing the map produced by each individual will give an expert a good idea of what the level of understanding each individual has on that particular topic, she says. Dr Stewart says the software is based on a technique called repertory grid interview, initially developed by an American engineer called George Kelly in 1930.

T1  - Images of a culture in transition: Personal constructs of organizational stability and change
AN  - 199401329; 01501351; 03392227
AB  - An investigation was undertaken in a large government business enterprise in a bid to examine the utility of the repertory grid technique in the investigation of organizational culture and to conduct an "audit" of performance culture.  The development of a methodology is described to gauge the rate of up-take of a new culture - from a public service orientation towards a customer service orientation.  Schein's (1990) theoretical framework was adopted in developing a 2-stage approach to the collection of data, which incorporated qualitative (in-depth interviews), and quantitative (survey) methods.  Results indicated that there was progress in the direction of the new culture desired by management.  There were 3 active cultures or groupings, articulated through the language of participants, which essentially mirrored a culture transition: those who had adopted the new culture, those who had partially adopted the new culture, and those who had not adopted the new culture.

T1  - "In the Eye of the Beholder": A New Approach to Studying Folk Theories of Leadership
AN  - 2181259982
AB  - Awareness that questionnaire ratings of leaders may be subject to systematic errors has led to increased emphasis on understanding the perceptual/memory processes underlying leadership ratings. Subordinates may judge leadership effectiveness based on their implicit leadership theories. Folk theories of leadership refers to these deeply felt and idiosyncratic theories of leadership behaviors. Borman's (1983) "Trait-Implication Procedure" based on Kelly's Repertory Grid technique was used to examine the leadership categorization schema of ten senior executives from a wide variety of organizations. Results indicate some association between the folk theories of leadership and the background/experience of the respondent. Implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.

T1  - Behaviours in organization: Chinese world views and perceptions of cross-cultural differences. A study of Hong Kong Chinese working in Canada
AN  - 304389526
AB  - This study inquired into the lived experience of the Hong Kong Chinese in Canada and captured snapshots of their perceptions of cross-cultural differences in organizational behaviour. To provide a base for study, I examined literature on organizational behaviour from the cross-cultural and the Chinese dimensions. To conceptualise how people perceive the world, I reviewed literature on the personal-construct theory and the schema theory.    The study used a qualitative mode of enquiry, with the researcher as an instrument to collect data through the in-depth interview and the repertory-grid methods. The participants, 8 men and 2 women, were either degree-holders or professionals with work experience in the service sectors in both Hong Kong and Canada. The study extracted their world views, which shape their interpretation of reality, from their narratives and work experience in both cultures. I identified 7 meta-narratives shaping the unique world view that differentiate them from Canadians at work; these meta-narratives dealt with: existence, achievement, work, conflict, power, relationship and communication. I also identified 4 major dimensions in modus operandi between these two cultures: planning, cooperation, leadership and controlling.    I adopted the phenomenological-hermeneutic approach to analyse and thematise the data collected through interviews. I also explored through the repertory-grid method the participants' constructs of the role-holders in organizations between these two cultures. The grid data were computed by the Focus programme. These two sets of results were compared and triangulated to increase the study's academic rigour.    The evidence shows that the Chinese perceived significant differences between themselves and Canadians in many dimensions of organizational behaviour. These differences obviously reflected these 2 cultures' underlining meta-narratives--the Chinese perceived Canadians as self-rather than organization-oriented, over-optimistic and carefree, uncommitted assertive, equalitarian, too frank and straightforward competitive in dealing with conflicts and intolerant to inequality. Clearly, their cultural perspective creates difficulty for Chinese working in Canada and Canadians or Western management specialists and educators attempting to work in Chinese societies.    The study concludes with implications for practice for people who work across the cultural line with Chinese, with recommendations on ways to enhance cultural understanding, and with directions for further research.

T1  - The Goldilocks pursuit in organizational selection: How recruiters form and use judgments of person-organization fit
AN  - 304350948
AB  - The Goldlilocks Pursuit describes recruiters' attempts to hire applicants who are "just right" for their companies. Judgments of "just right" include recruiters' perceptions of an applicant's person-job (P-J) and person-organization (P-O) fit. P-J fit has been the traditional focus of selection research, but P-O fit has only recently been investigated as a factor in hiring decisions.    Two studies were conducted to answer remaining questions regarding recruiters' P-O fit perceptions. A qualitative methodology was used in Study One to determine what types of characteristics recruiters use to assess applicants' P-O fit, and how similar these characteristics are across organizations. Thirty-two recruiters from four consulting organizations completed repertory grid interviews (Kelly, 1955) in which they compared video-taped job applicants to determine who had the best P-J and P-O fit. Results indicate both unique and shared predictors of fit perceptions, with more skill and experience characteristics leading to judgments of P-J fit, and more personality and value characteristics relating to P-O fit perceptions. Many recruiters used idiosyncratic preferences to determine both types of fit; however, there was also support for organization-specific and universally desirable characteristics influencing fit perceptions.    Structural equations modeling was used in Study Two to determine the relative effects of P-O fit, P-J fit, applicant-recruiter similarity, and liking on recruiters' hiring recommendations. Recruiters from two organizations evaluated 80 applicants during a regular recruiting cycle. Results indicate that perceptions of P-J and P-O fit are highly related, but are predicted by somewhat distinct characteristics. P-J fit perceptions were the best predictor of hiring recommendations, although P-O fit perceptions were also significant predictors. Results also suggest that perceptions of P-O fit mediate the relationship between perceived applicant-recruiter similarity and hiring recommendations better than does recruiters' liking of the applicants.    Together, these studies provide a comprehensive examination of how recruiters form and use impressions of applicants' P-O fit during the selection process. Implications for improving assessments of fit and how they are used in conjunction with other evaluations of applicants to increase the overall effectiveness of the hiring process intended to find the applicants whose fit is "just right" are included.

T1  - Team performance: using repertory grid technique to gain a view from the inside
AN  - 217098014
AB  - Measuring team performance through use of repertory grid technique is novel; it appears to have some advantages over the use of conventional questionnaires and inventories. Once a set of constructs relevant to a particular team's circumstances is generated, it can be used at regular intervals to measure changes in team performance. A particular set of constructs, though, may have a limited life. As the purpose and processes of a team change, the constructs relevant to that team's performance may need to change with new sets of constructs identified, using the same technique as before. Thus the method of measuring team performance is dynamic, keeping pace with changes in the team itself.

AB  - Numerous computerized repertory grid programs are available to researchers and clinicians; however, these programs operate in a DOS environment, and many are cumbersome to use.  Baldwin et al introduce the first Windows-based repertory grid program, making the analysis of repertory grids easier and thus more useful for researchers and practitioners in the behavioral sciences.

T1  - Drivers' risk assessments and their impact on seat belt use
AN  - 213757331; 01318524
AB  - The repertory grid technique is used as the main research instrument for eliciting drivers' knowledge to explore the factors that have impact on seat belt use.  Principal components analysis identified 5 factors underlying drivers' risk assessments: severity, predictability/foreseeability, fault, frequency/unsafe behavior, and hit/air bag impact.  The results show that the perceived risk and perceived importance of seat belt use are influenced by situational factors: the direction of collision, the location of collision, and the existence of an air bag system.  The implication is that belt use campaigns might be more successful if they focused on modifying perceived risk.

T1  - Understanding the basis of treatment choices for varicose veins: a model for decision making with the repertory grid technique.
AN  - 1770033679
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use the repertory grid technique as a method for identifying and rating the criteria that clinicians use to make a choice between the different treatment options for patients with a common condition such as varicose veins. DESIGN: The "expert panel" consensus method for rating the appropriateness of clinical procedures was modified with an existing psychometric method, the repertory grid technique. To identify the criteria used to decide about treatment, the panel members compared and contrasted a range of nine "treatment prototypes". They were then required to rate each criterion for its relevance to each treatment prototype. SETTING: The panel was selected from different geographical locations in the South Western Regional Health Authority. SUBJECTS: The expert panel was composed of six vascular surgeons, three from teaching and three from non-teaching hospitals; two general practitioners who were also clinical assistants in vascular surgery; and one honorary senior lecturer in general practice. MAIN MEASURES: Decision making criteria were categorised according to their content. Their frequency of replication was noted-that is, how many clinicians used the same criterion. Computer analysis of the rating scores for the nine panel members identified the relative importance of each treatment criterion for each treatment option. RESULTS: 161 criteria for the treatment of varicose veins were elicited from the nine participants. These criteria were wide ranging, from clinical indications (48% of those used), to social (32%), and organisational factors (20%). Clinical indications were more likely to be used when deciding about surgery as a high priority, whereas social and organisational criteria were more likely to be applied in decisions about surgery as a low priority, day case surgery, and cosmetic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The repertory grid technique proved to be effective in modelling decision making for a condition such as varicose veins: its use enabled both the identification of the wide range of criteria underlying the decision to treat and the exploration of the relative importance of these criteria in relation to several treatment options. Its potential as a method for reducing variation in clinical decision making and thus improving distribution of high quality care lies in its ability to pinpoint dilemmas of decision making rather than as the basis for drawing up guidelines to regulate decision making practice.

T1  - Cognitive maps in the analysis of personal change during work role transition
AN  - 229485014; 01204592
AB  - The way in which personal construct psychology and repertory grids can be used to produce cognitive maps is illustrated, and psychological adjustment during the transition from college to employment is analyzed.  Cognitive maps are based on the principal component analysis of repertory grid data and provide a visual representation of the way in which the subjects see themselves in relation to other people and in relation to their construct.  The cognitive maps produced by 2 graduates shortly after entry in employment and 6 months later are analyzed and compared in order to identify trends of personal change.  The case studies show that the analysis of the cognitive maps provides some valuable insights into the way in which graduates change their construction of themselves and of their work environment during the period of transition.

T1  - Cognitive complexity in group performance and satisfaction
AN  - 304271855
AB  - In this study, a comparison was made between the various levels of group cognitive complexity and its relationship to task performance and task satisfaction. The goal of this research is to answer the general question, "Should decision-making groups consist of individuals who are similar in the way they differentiate and/or integrate various stimuli in order to increase performance and satisfaction?"    The preceding research problem was analyzed in a laboratory setting using a 2 x 2 factorial design blocked on the variable, cognitive complexity. The Repertory Grid was used to measure the cognitive complexity of 228 student subjects. These subjects were stratified into groups of three based on their cognitive complexity score on the Repertory Grid (Kelly, 1955). Each group was treated randomly with one of two levels of task complexity (complex or not complex). Moreover, the groups received an imposed group structure that incorporated centralized or decentralized decision-making.    Results indicated that groups consisting of cognitively complex members outperformed groups consisting of noncomplex members. No support was obtained for the two-way interaction between group cognitive complexity and either task complexity or group structure. Support was obtained for the interaction between task complexity and group structure on both task satisfaction measures. The highest satisfaction levels occurred with a complex task in a decentralized structure. In addition, the three-way interaction effect on the task satisfaction scale between group structure, task complexity, and group cognitive complexity was significant. The means, however, were not in the predicted direction. For cognitively simple groups, a complex task with a decentralized structure lead to the highest task satisfaction level; whereas, a less complex task with a decentralized group structure lead to the lowest task satisfaction score for noncomplex members. There were no significant differences for cognitively complex groups when analyzing the three-way interaction between group cognitive complexity, task complexity, and group structure.

T1  - Factors affecting information systems' success
AN  - 233642918
AB  - There is continuing difficulty in achieving success with information systems, particularly in the sense of meeting users' expectations and offers a fresh examination of those attributes of information systems by which users perceive success and failure, and through which they establish their expectations. Existing research literature is reviewed and it is suggested that, in addition to the process and product viewpoint, an important factor in achieving success is the service management perspective. Repertory grid techniques are applied to uncover a total of 43 constructs which relate to users' perceptions of success with information systems in business. These are reduced to 21 attributes which provide the basis of a new assessment and measurement framework, incorporating and augmenting the attributes found in previous work in this area.

T1  - Using repertory grids in management
AN  - 215399890
AB  - Since 1980, many changes have occurred in both the use and the application of the repertory grid technique. Unlike the initial monograph, this paper places greater emphasis on practicalities of completing a grid and the different types of analysis possible than on the applications of the grid. The grid offers a powerful way of quantifying people's attitudes, feelings, and perceptions. It focuses on how an individual focuses on how a single individual understands his or her own world in a particular context.

T1  - A Repertory Grid Test of the Claim That Sense of Landscape Naturalness Is Specific to Culture
AN  - 1987643753
AB  - Repertory grid technique was used to test the claim that sense of landscape naturalness is socially constructed and culturally relative, and the reverse claim that sense of landscape naturalness is underlain by universals of human thought. Participants made judgments of sameness and difference concerning elements in a standard landscape of nine elements. Sample groups represented three cultures at extremes along a continuum of ideology concerning human relations with nature: Euro-Canadian at one end, Vuntut Gwich'in and north Baffin Inuit at the other. Results were consistent with the universalist but not the relativist hypothesis. Although principal factors for the three culture samples differ slightly, a common factor is nested within the variation, and it corresponds to the Euro-Canadian construct (natural x man-made). The study has implications for environmental education and environmental planning.

T1  - Validating a method for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures
AN  - 231420805; 01090536; 02501907
AB  - Cognitive mapping techniques refer to methods used to elicit the structure and content of people's mental models.  There is growing interest in applying these techniques to the study of managers' mental models of strategic management issues.  A new method is suggested for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures, that is based upon recent developments in the cognitive psychology of the categorization of concepts.  The method is evaluated with respect to its psychometric properties against the well established, but potentially cumbersome, repertory grid technique.  The method is demonstrated to have good validity by comparing it with the repertory grid technique.

T1  - Developing a lay model of managerial effectiveness: A social constructionist perspective
AN  - 194217103; 01083636
AB  - A study uses repertory grid interviews and a follow-up questionnaire study to develop a "lay" theory of managerial effectiveness in a large New Zealand public sector organization.  The lay theory is presented as a model with 17 scales and 2 factors descriptive of effective and ineffective managers in the organization.  The 2 factors indicate that effective and ineffective managers in the department are differentiated in terms of their conceptual, and interpersonal abilities.  The effectiveness model shows strong similarity to models of effective management which have emerged in research outside New Zealand.  This similarity is of particular interest given the context-specific nature of the study.

T1  - Feminist Identifications in a Troubled Society
AN  - 1988006207
AB  - This article reports selected findings from a programme of postgraduate research which examined women's identifications with feminism in Northern Ireland. This qualitative study used repertory grids and semi-structured interviews to explore the meanings of feminism with a total of 31 women. It shows how women `s perceptions of feminists have affected their decisions about whether or not to identify themselves as such. The data reported here are from case studies of 26 women. The repertory grids uncovered perceived commonalities and differences between women `s present and ideal selves and feminists, while the interviews revealed some of the conflicts women negotiate in their daily lives and the compromises they                       must
                   
 make in attempts at conflict resolution. A conflicting picture emerges in which many women support feminist ideals but do not identify as feminists because of a negative stereotype of feminists. While this stereotype has specific connotations in the context of Northern Ireland, it seems likely that certain aspects of it, and the ways in which it is used, may apply to other patriarchal and heterosexist societies.

AB  - An analysis identifies the dimensions of a higher customer contact food and beverage operative's job as perceived by managers, supervisors, and operatives and examines within-source and between-source differences in these perceptions.  The analysis uses 2 instruments, the repertory grid and the work profiling system.  It shows a number of distinct dimensions that are defined in terms of the worker behaviors necessary for the job tasks to be performed.  Managers/supervisors and operatives generally agree on a number of dimensions.  The analysis discusses variations occurring both with and between groups as well as implications for the choice of sources of job analysis data and the use of job analysis in a personnel selection and training context.

T1  - Women's view of pubs: A study of methods
AN  - 215863477; 01001079
AB  - Customers' experience of service encounters remains an area blessed with a rich folklore but little fundamental understanding.  A pilot study  explored women's experiences of public houses, and used idographic methods on a small sample of middle-class women: role repertory grids, critical-incident questionnaires, individual comparatively unstructured interviews, and group focus interviews.  Group interviews were most useful for coming quickly to a consensus picture, and the critical incident questionnaires allowed extreme examples of good and bad practice to be explored.  It is concluded that there is considerable variation in what women are looking to find in pubs, but that they agree on their dislike of male-dominated atmospheres in which they are harassed or made to feel unwelcome.

T1  - Subjective constructs and first appraisal in women with breast cancer
AN  - 304168936
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe patterns of personal cognitive constructs and first appraisal in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. A framework integrating the Folkman and Lazarus coping model (1984) and Kelly's Personal Construct Theory (1955) guided this study.    Sixty-two women from five different Italian regional hospitals participated in the study. Subjects were interviewed just prior to breast surgery. Breast surgery consisted of lumpectomy. Personal cognitive constructs were elicited during in-depth face-to-face interviews using Kelly's Repertory Grid technique (Kelly, 1955). First appraisal was measured using a visual analog scale with an investigator developed self report questionnaire. The basis for the questionnaire was Lazarus' three appraisal categories: Challenge, Threat, and Harm/Loss (Lazarus & Folkman, 1985). First appraisal was assessed both as perceived during the interview and as remembered by the subject immediately after the diagnosis. Demographic data were collected using an investigator designed demographic data form. Subjects were interviewed between 1 to 10 weeks following diagnosis. Fifty-two subjects were interviewed prior to the surgery, 10 were interviewed following surgery.    Many events used by the women to elicit their cognitive constructs were similar. The category "Challenge" was referred to by the majority of the women as the most intense at the time of the interview; based on the participant's memory, "Challenge" was also described by the majority as the most intense immediately following the diagnosis. No relationship was found between the participants' demography and category of appraisal. Some differences in the patterns of constructs characterized the subjects within the three appraisal categories.    Three conclusions were drawn: (a) the women generally used some similar typologies of events in construing the meanings of their disease; (b) the women preferred "Challenge" among the three categories of appraisal of cancer; and (c) there were some distinctive features in the patterns of personal cognitive constructs of women who appraised their breast cancer as Harm/Loss, Threat, or Challenge.    This study used a convenience sample of 62 Italian women, therefore the results are not generalizable beyond the participants. An insufficient number of subjects who had had surgery were accrued to the study to determine differences between those who had had surgery and those who had not. It is possible that women who participated had motives that were different than women who may have declined, and/or the physician had motives in approaching the participants. The majority of interviews were held in clinical settings exposed to environmental noise beyond the control of the interviewers. The translation from Italian to English may have caused modifications within the original meanings assigned by the participants. Lazarus's categories of appraisal may assume a different meaning when translated within Italian culture.    This study can be replicated on comparable samples of women across countries to evaluate the role of national cultures upon appraisal and constructs. Longitudinal research is needed to assess changes within constructs from diagnosis through to surgery, and finally, experimental research is needed to test the study's underlying assumption of a link between constructs and first appraisal of cancer and to evaluate the nursing interventions that could be used to help women with breast cancer.

T1  - The structure and content of organizational identity in hypercompetitive environments
AN  - 304164476
AB  - This research explored the structure and content of the organizational identity--members' beliefs about central, distinctive, and enduring organizational attributes--for a high performing organization operating in a rapidly and discontinuously changing hypercompetitive environment. The study compared the dimensions of organizational attributes provided by members for similarities and differences across subunits and the organization as a whole. Analyses examined the extent to which organizational identity attributes are shared, and assessed the potential existence of distinct, coherent subidentities across geographic locations, business units, and organizational levels. The study also examined a new theory of organizational identity structure and content. This theory posits that intangible aspects of organizational identity will be more central than substantive elements in high performing organizations. As a first step in validating this theory, the study examined whether organizational identity dimensions for a hypercompetitive organization can validly be classified into intangible and substantive categories.    A sample of Intel Corporation employees completed an instrument based on a method that originated in cognitive psychology, the repertory grid technique. This method allowed organization members to identify dimensions of organizational attributes of Intel without the imposition of the researcher's frame of reference. This technique provided insights into the cognitive frameworks members hold regarding their high performance organization in a hypercompetitive environment.    The study found that organization members do share organizational identity attributes, although the number of widely shared attributes is small. Additionally, when members rated various organizational identity components along self-supplied dimensions, they made significant distinctions between current and ideal organizational identity. Evidence also was discovered supporting the existence of distinct subidentities by location, business unit, and organizational level. Preliminary support was obtained for the classification of identity attributes as either intangible or substantive.    The major theoretical contributions of this research are the verification of shared organizational identity attributes, the documentation of distinct organizational subidentities, and a theory of two types of organizational identity attributes for hypercompetitive organizations was proposed and tested. This study's primary methodological contribution is the application of a promising methodology for the study of organizational identity.

T1  - Change in self construction during the transition from university to employment: A personal construct psychology approach
AN  - 199362776; 00952199
AB  - A personal construct psychology framework and repertory grids were used in a longitudinal study designed to analyze the qualitative and evaluative nature of change in graduates' self-construction during the 6 months following organizational entry.  In line with the hypotheses guiding the research, the results suggest that graduates undertook some important qualitative change in self-construction but that these trends of change reflected individual developmental paths rather than a common socialization effect; change took place through both the development of new core role constructs, and change in self-ratings on stable constructs (slot change).  The study provides some modest support for the hypothesis concerning the positive relationship between self-esteem and role meaningfulness.  However, the initial level of self-esteem does not appear to moderate the effect of low role meaningfulness on subsequent  level of self-esteem, a finding that fails to support the hypothesis.

The goal of the investigation was to use interviews to identify how customers perceive product support for high-technology products (using the medical equipment market as a test case).  Product support is the name given in industry to the various forms of assistance that companies provide to customers to help them obtain maximum value from high-technology products.  Several key points emerged from the interviews: 1.  Interviews need careful design and piloting, to ensure that they achieve the research goals and fit with the boundary conditions of the sample and market under investigation.  2.  The repertory grid method can be used to help subjects articulate their views on a complex topic, in a situation where direct questioning is liable to cause interviewer bias.  3.  The repertory grid method  produces clear descriptions on constructs - so that they are unequivocal.

T1  - Clumping data in 2-way tables: A user-orientated perspective
AN  - 231359962; 00821816
AB  - Following a critique of existing algorithms, an algorithm is presented which will reorganize a 2-way data table to bring like rows together, and like columns together.  Extensions of the method are described, and justified, to accommodate distances measured in modular arithmetic, and with bipolar columns/rows, as in repertory grid analysis.  One value of the algorithms is that the user can see relationships in the tables without the data in the cells themselves ever having been transformed.  Thus, users will continue to feel they own their data.

AN  - 228367288; 00861423
AB  - Quality initiatives need to be translated into actions by employees.  The importance of eliciting the knowledge and beliefs that employees use to guide their decisions at work is highlighted, and it is argued that everyday discourse (for example, conversation and group discussion) is an inadequate basis from which to unearth this information.  A variety of psychological techniques that can be used to help people "get at" their own views are outlined.  A study is reported that used situational interviewing and the repertory grid technique to elicit the models that food servers in the hospitality industry have of internal systems and procedures.  The "maps" that food servers have of service situations and colleagues reveal areas for quality improvement.

T1  - Gender, diversity and working styles
AN  - 213150619; 00848971
AB  - Evidence from a research study into the impact of gender on management styles is presented using repertory grid as a methodology.  Generalized differences were identified in the approaches of women and men to definition of the job, overall style, decision making, and interpersonal relationships.  Men had greater visibility to other men, while a broader insight was offered by women interviewees into the women managers' approaches.  In the context of patriarchal power relations, in which masculinity is defined as opposite and superior to femininity, feminine working styles are perceived as less effective in organizations, while masculine attributes tend to be regarded as normatively the way to manage.  Such values can imbue recruitment, selection, and development practices with gender bias.  Recent management and leadership theory has advocated the value of a people-centered approach, which traditionally and stereotypically has been associated with women.  There is a need to be alert to a redefinition of patriarchal relations as men seek to maintain status.

The book mentions two other criteria for assessing people but these are harder to translate: "using a repertory grid methodology to lead managers to differentiate between successful and less successful individuals and therefore behaviours; and collecting a wide range of information by the use of an appropriately designed job analysis questionnaire".

T1  - Decision making in health service managers
AN  - 212085009; 00807396
AB  - Although the literature on managerial decision making typically espouses rationality, this rarely occurs.  Managers form a personal and simplified model of the real situation, incorporating personal and environmental factors, to facilitate their decision making.  A study used a repertory grid to explore the decision making model of 16 National Health Service managers and investigate what factors were important to them when considering strategic decisions.  Results indicated the complex and idiosyncratic nature of managerial decision making, vindicating the view that to understand decision making in any detail requires knowledge of the individual's model.  Rationality did not emerge as the driving force underlying the managers' decision making behavior.  For many managers, emotional items seemed to exert a significant influence on their decision making.  A link between patterns of construing and stress was hypothesized.  Managers whose construing was simpler, contained contradictions, or was more emotional in content reported experiencing more stress.

AB  - Abstract. The selection and evaluation of road schemes through the Leitch framework is based on a combination of cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment. Both techniques involve the definition and valuation of a number of costs and benefits. These costs and benefits are defined and valued in isolation to each other so that we Imow virtually nothing about the relative valuation that people assign to different types of costs and benefits which might affect them directly or indirectly. This paper outlines the development of a method which allows people to conceptualise the costs and benefits of a road scheme in their own terms and then to rank schemes in relation to those costs and benefits. This method is based upon an interview process involving the use of repertory grid technique. The information from the repertory grid technique is used as a sound basis for determining trade-offs between attributes and for attempting to obtain monetary valuations of different project attributes. A number of exploratory interviews are reported which outline some of the difficulties with a number of the survey features including the choice of case-study, interviewer and information biases and sample and non-response biases. Various ways of dealing with these difficulties are discussed.

T1  - The Role of Fragrances in Product Development: Turning Images into Fragrances
AN  - 196319738; 00628116
AB  - The sensory properties of products are particularly important in the area of fine fragrances.  In an investigation, 10 assessors discussed some 19 fragrances, 19 essential oils, and 8 relevant chemical stimuli over a number of sessions.  Using group discussion, repertory grid, direct mapping, and simple profiling approaches, the assessors derived a list of 14 defined descriptors.  Fragrance descriptions and characteristics were grouped and reduced to a list which was used to obtain consumer reactions to actual fragrances assessed blind.  Under controlled evaluation conditions, 23 consumers tested 16 fragrances.  The sensory analysis and the subsequent linking of this to the image data showed that fragrant formulations can be identified in a consistent way using trained assessors and that this descriptive information can give good guidance to the product developer about what type of fragrance will suit a particular market position or the tastes of a particular consumer segment.

T1  - Cognitive Mapping and Repertory Grids for Qualitative Survey Research: Some Comparative Observations
AN  - 194219945; 00626878
AB  - A study of business strategy was carried out in 86 organizations in the crop protection industry.  A multi-operational approach was used to enable validation of data by triangulation.  This provided an opportunity to conduct a comparative evaluation of interactional investigative methods in a relatively controlled manner.  Some conclusions of the analysis are: 1.  Cognitive mapping satisfies many more process criteria than repertory grids.  2.  The data that cognitive maps produce are less comparable than the data from repertory grids.  3.  Splitting maps produced under the constraints introduced for the purposes of the project (actual versus ideal states) allows the respondent to focus on specific aspects of the ideal state one at a time and in contrast to the actual.  4.  Cognitive maps-as-programs possibly do not represent the cognitive structure of the client's own problem conception.  5.  Skeleton entries to cognitive maps (COPE) can be preferable to full-string entry for certain purposes, such as the analysis of large survey data.

T1  - Validating an Expert Support System for Tender Enquiry Evaluation: A Case Study
AN  - 231388133; 00610102
AB  - The Tender Enquiry Evaluation System (TEES) was developed as a support tool for a large electromechanical engineering company.  The system was developed to assist in tender enquiry evaluation and the bid versus no bid decision.  It was developed using repertory grid techniques based on the expertise of 2 senior managers.  The importance of the system's validation is stressed, and an appropriate formal validation framework is developed.  The results from the validation study suggest that the system provides an appropriate model of the organization's consensual business perspective regarding the bid versus no bid decision.  Furthermore, the study drew attention to some dissenting views among the organization's senior management that the managers believed to be helpful in clarifying their understanding of the issues affecting the bid versus no bid decision.

T1  - Validation of the Repertory Grid for Use in Modeling Knowledge
AN  - 231382313; 00603508
AB  - The extrapolation of theories of cognitive modeling from the psychological contexts to the domain of information systems design has raised empirical questions regarding the validity and reliability of these techniques in the new applications environment.  Kelly's (1955) theory of personal construct psychology (PCP) is one such theory that, together with the repertory grid technique of cognitive modeling, is being explored for use in systems development.  Since the repertory grid constitutes a mechanism for both the elicitation and the representation of cognitive models, it has been suggested for incorporation into intelligent front-end interfaces for information storage and retrieval systems (ISRS).  Previous applications of the grid have emphasized the personal and ideographic characteristics of personal construct systems.  The repertory grid is tested for representing commonality of construing among members of a homogeneous group of subjects.  Some differences are noted between constructs generated by subjects and those provided for them by an expert.  Implications of this effect for the application of PCP to ISRS design are discussed.

T1  - Developing an Expert Support System for Tender Enquiry Evaluation: A Case Study
AN  - 204125984; 00614855
AB  - Assessing customers' tender inquiries to decide whether to bid or not is important for companies where the cost of tendering is high.  In the case considered, the expertise of 2 managers involved in assessing inquiries was developed into an expert support system.  Knowledge was elicited from these managers by asking them to consider previous tenders and specify the factors used in discriminating between them.  Their responses were rerpresented in repertory grids.  Analyses of these grids led to maps that show the hierarchical nature of the relationships between the key factors used by the managers.  The resulting expert support system improved the consistency of the inquiry review group, revealed unexpected aspects of the managers' reasoning and was generally welcomed by the company.

AB  - A model of effective set advising is researched from a literature review and repertory grid interviews with set advisers and is then tested against experience.  The 4 key dimensions that need to be managed to be able to deal effectively with a set are: 1.  the content dimension, which requires interpersonal skills and project diagnosis, planning, and management, 2.  the process dimension, by which the set adviser communicates and transfers action learning, the nature of team and group dynamics, and the basic group processes, 3.  the human feelings dimension, including how feelings are dealt with, put into a frame of reference, revealed, and acted upon, and 4.  the administration dimension, which involves ensuring that the logistics are in place.  Total contingency theories are challenged.  Behavioral and conceptual tools are developed by which advisers can be coached and developed over the dynamic life cycle of the set.

T1  - On Elephants and Blind Researchers: Methods for Accessing Culture in Organisations
AN  - 1698138491
AB  - This research compares two pre-existing methodologies for accessing culture, repertory grids and focused group discussions, with a modified version of the Twenty Statements Test (Kuhn and McPartland, 1954), a method originally developed to measure self concept. The comparison is made on the basis of three criteria: the levels and elements of culture accessed by the different methods; the amount and usefulness of the information gathered; and finally, the ease of use of the methods. The comparison of the methods is based on information gathered from 158 participants in a major UK company and the results clearly suggest that the modified Twenty Statements Test has most potential as a method for accessing culture in organisation. The results also suggest that the conceptualisation of aspects of culture needs to be clearer and more focused if progress in understanding about the content and consequences of culture is to be made.

T1  - Management Consultancy: Dimensions of Client-Consultancy Relationships
AN  - 1698137239
AB  - Although a great deal of management consultancy has been carried out in a wide variety of settings, very little research has been conducted examining underlying dimensions of the client-consultant relationship. The present study examines consultant and client perceptions of the consulting relationship. A procedure based on repertory grid technique was employed to elicit dimensions of client consultant relationships from 22 management consultants and 16 of their clients within a major UK company. A questionnaire was then developed in order to determine the importance and frequency of these dimensions to participants, and also to highlight the differences between the views of clients and consultants. Dimensions were found to fall within four broad categories: those relating to the client; those relating to the consultant; dimensions associated with contract details; and dimensions focused on relationship building. While both clients and consulting relationships, they differed in emphasis they placed on the different categories. More specifically, consultants viewed dimensions relating to relationship building as most important, while clients placed greater emphasis on dimensions associated with contract details. Recommendations, based on these findings are made for monitoring and enhancing client-consultant relationships.

AB  - Research has examined personal change and stability in early adulthood but generally with standardized scales and without inviting explicit comparison of self with other people. The present work uses the repertory grid method to examine how graduates construe themselves and others during early career. Ninety-four graduate entrants to a multinational corporation with zero to four years' tenure completed repertory grids on two occasions one year apart. Results shed much light on the graduates' concepts of self relative to others in their work setting, and how these change over time. The graduates generally had fairly positive self concepts, though these did not become more positive with tenure. Most saw themselves much as they thought others saw them. Change in concepts of self varied greatly between graduates, as did the constructs on which those concepts were described. The results cast further doubt on whether organizational socialization affects people in uniform ways.

T1  - Etude préliminaire de l'abus sexuel précoce
AN  - 1969736706
AB  - The long term effects of sexual abuse are often measured by measuring behaviours such as social adjustment, job stability and marriage. This study was conducted to add to these internal measures. Using a semi-prospective instrument adapted from G. Kelly's repertory grid, the adolescents' perceptions of themselves and significant others are measured. Three hundred and twelve female adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19 (average age = 16) participated in the study; 79 presented with non sexual behaviour disorders (delinquency, stealing, etc.), 56 presented with serious sexual behaviour disorders (prostitution, persistant sexual promiscuity) and 177 presented with no problems requiring psychosocial intervention. Various analyses (descriptive, multiple variance, regression analysis) showed that sexual abuse significantly affects many of the adolescents' perceptions. Sexually abused adolescents perceived their two real parents as less competent and their ideal mother and father as less protective than adolescents who had not been abused. In contrast, their perception of self and the ideal self was not affected by the sexual abuse, a finding which will spark discussion.

T1  - A Question of Competency
AN  - 202753174; 00504121
AB  - Managers are now being encouraged to list the competencies that any employee in the organization needs to operate successfully.  The competencies are then used in selection, promotion, appraisal, counseling, and vocational guidance.  Lists of competencies come from autocratic chief executives and directors who go through focused interviews.  The lists also are acquired by group discussions, repertory grids, analysis, or adapting someone else's list.  Organizations devise ways of measuring the competencies so that applicants and employees can be compared and contrasted.  While there is a wealth of theories and studies attempting to specify the basic traits and abilities that are common to employees in a particular business, the question of what precisely competencies are remains unanswered.  A list of competencies is just that - a list, but human abilities are clearly related.  After deciding on its competency profile, an organization should investigate the structure of the competencies.

T1  - Repertory Grid Technique in Employee Selection
AN  - 214808582; 00509200
AB  - The repertory grid technique (RGT) is a psychological technique capable of elucidating the person-job match and the job-person match in employee selection.  The grid basically is a sorting exercise designed to elicit the dimensions, criteria, or constructs underlying an individual's rationale for all sorting decisions made.  Although essentially different, the task reactions repertory grid and the interview perceptions repertory grid hint at 2 inherent advantages - flexibility of design and face validity to participants.  Despite potential disadvantages with grids, the RGT and the underlying theoretical stance of personal construct psychology have much potential as an alternative and complementary strategy in employee selection.  When considering uses of the grid where the recruiter is acting as a participant, 3 interrelated applications arise: 1.  interviewer training, 2.  interviewer selection, and 3.  the identification of candidate assessment criteria.  A 2nd set of grid applications involves the applicant as the participant and follows from the contention that the RGT could be used to examine the job-person match.

Results did not support Frascella's 1972 assumption that constructs relating to fluency differ in the communication subsystems of stutterers and nonstutterers.  Stereotypical notions about stuttering were characteristic of stutterers and nonstutterers.

T1  - Intuition in Venture Capital Decisions: An Exploratory Study Using a New Technique
AN  - 195844086; 00497375; 00270535
AB  - An exploratory study used the repertory grid technique, drawn from personal construct psychology, to develop an understanding of intuition.  In-depth interviews with 5 venture capitalists were conducted to obtain information about the particular constructs each uses in thinking about investment proposals.  The goal was to obtain systematic data on the content and structure of intuitions prior to the development of a questionnaire to be issued to a larger sample.  The results indicated that investment constructs can be grouped into 3 areas: management, unique opportunity, and appropriate return.  A cluster analysis showed that each venture capitalist had his own way of structuring the intuitions involved in the investment decision.  The results suggested that individuals seeking venture capital may need to adjust their approach to different venture capitalists in view of the diversity involved.

T1  - Knowledge Bases: Integration, Verification, and Partitioning
AN  - 204166494; 00466628
AB  - A literature review is presented of 3 aspects of knowledge base design: 1.  knowledge integration, 2.  knowledge verification, and 3.  knowledge-base partitioning.  The key approaches to combining multiple expertise include: 1.  metaknowledge, 2.  set theoretic, 3.  consensus theory, 4.  repertory grid analysis, 5.  cluster analysis, and 6.  decision theory.  Combining expertise improves poor individual performance but degrades good individual performance.  This means that it is preferable to construct expert systems using consensus when the domain knowledge does not exists in a state of high conflict.  Verification techniques include: 1.  knowledge acquisition-based verification, 2.  graph-based verification, 3.  confidence-value verification, and 4.  iterative verification.  Most verification techniques can be classified as either consistency checkers or completeness checkers.  Information-theoretic approaches and cluster analysis approaches are among the knowlege-base partitioning methods.

T1  - The Brightest and the Best: Factors Influencing the Retention or Withdrawal of Completing Teachers
AN  - 1979058489
AB  - Allegations that the most able simply intend to leave teaching were challenged by qualitative and quantitative data collected from 147 prospective teachers completing their credentialling diploma. A conceptual framework combining personal construct and social learning theories modelled the influences of personal, academic and social factors on intended persistence. A single line version of the repertory grid elicited reasons for intended persistence or withdrawal which were coded into 11 categories supported by the literature. A multiple classification analysis showed that those who were confident of promotion and who were committed to and satisfied by teaching intended persisting. While the findings were less clear for psychological constructs and for academic and social integration, some of the best prospective teachers intended staying for at least five years. The course itself was well received.

T1  - Important Dimensions of Strategic Issues: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
AN  - 194221024; 00465955
AB  - Decision makers must use dimensions to sort the wheat from the chaff in the field of potential strategic issues.  The dimensions implied by 3 literatures and dimensions generated by an empirical study are compared.  A search of the 3 literatures identified 26 dimensions that differentiate strategic issues.  Repertory grid techniques were used to identify the range of attributes used to define the "meaning space" for strategic issues in a sample of strategic decision makers at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  Dimensions in the literature overlap those in the empirical study; 13 dimensions accounted for 51% of the frequency with which all attributes were mentioned over all respondents.  However, these 13 dimensions exclude the one cited most often in the literature - immediacy.  Also, marked differences in the relative importance of classes of dimensions emerged in the sample relative to the literature.  Issue content was about 3 times as prevalent in the sample, action was about the same in both, analytic characteristics were almost twice as prevalent in the literature, and source did not emerge in the sample at all.

T1  - Construing the Business Portfolio: A Cognitive Model of Diversification
AN  - 194219336; 00465957
AB  - Researchers investigating the relationship between diversification and performance have been generally inattentive to the dominant general management logics that corporate-level managers use to understand and manage strategy diversity.  In response to this, the use of the repertory grid is proposed.  The grid is a methodology adapted from the work of Kelly (1955) and other personal construct theorists.  As an approach to operationalizing the mental maps that direct the management of strategic diversity, the business repertory grid appears to have several important advantages.  It is particularly useful in assessing the ways in which top managers construe the corporate portfolio and manage strategic diversity.  Grid technique is flexible, efficient, and systematic.  It is also highly reproducible, thus allowing researchers to validate or challenge the results of previous studies.  A main goal of the application of the repertory grid to the study of strategic diversity is to measure the way in which top managers perceive relationships among businesses in their firms.

T1  - Exploring the Meaning of Work and Nonwork
AN  - 224870755; 00450278
AB  - A study explored the relationship between work and nonwork activities for a group of employed professional and skilled tradespeople in New Zealand.  A preliminary sample of 40 subjects were used to to develop a 12-element repertory grid that was included in the questionnaires mailed to accountants, dentists, lawyers, primary school teachers, and plumbers.  Eighty-one usable responses were obtained.  The results confirmed previous research with the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic features of paid employment and the importance of a 3rd factor related to stress, time constraints, and the lack of free choice.  The results reaffirmed that job satisfaction is associated with the chance to use abilities and skills and with recognition for work well done.  More surprising was the clear distinction that these subjects made between the work and nonwork aspects of their lives and the perceived differences between their paid employment activities and nonwork activities, with little evidence of generalization between them.

T1  - Do Psychotherapists Use Different Construct Subsystems for Construing Clients and Acquaintances? A Repertory Grid Study
AN  - 848882787
AB  - Forty-seven psychotherapists were studied to determine if they used different construct subsystems for construing clients and personal acquaintances. The sample included therapists who varied in terms of sex, age, years of experience, and clinical discipline. Subjects chose six personal acquaintances and six nonpsychotic individual therapy clients who were then used as elements in a Repertory Grid. Constructs were elicited by comparing pairs of elements; all elements were rated on the constructs. It was found that constructs elicited about one domain (clients or acquaintances) were less applicable to elements from the other domain. Therapists more often used constructs related to emotional stability when construing clients than acquaintances, whereas differences in construct content were not evident on several other dimensions. The domain of client construal exhibited greater cognitive differentiation and hierarchical organization than did that of acquaintance construal. The results suggest that therapists use different conceptual subsystems for client and acquaintance construal. Implications for the training of therapists are discussed.

AN  - 237018506; 00445702
AB  - Techniques are required to enable the user and analyst to work together in formulating and developing a model for the analysis of problems characterized by unclear statement of requirements.  Some techniques are described, and the rationale for their application to the process of information requirements analysis in the context of an experimental strategy is discussed.  In particular, the techniques described are delphi, game playing, operational experimentations, opinion questionnaires and surveys, pilot studies, prototyping, repertory grids, and system simulation.  Guidelines to support strategy formulation include considering: 1.  the purpose of the exercise, 2.  the underlying methodological approach, 3.  the particular strategy adopted, and 4.  the technique or mixture of techniques.  Analysis indicates there is a need to develop an experimental plan, a need to formulate strategy, and a need to understand the characteristics of the techniques.

T1  - Building Societies as Retail Banks: The Importance of Customer Service and Corporate Image
AN  - 231439820; 00449302; 00097163
AB  - UK building societies have successfully attracted funds in a deregulated environment; however, they have begun to lose some of their dominance in the mortgage market.  In a more competitive environment, building societies are diversifying and using more effective marketing techniques.  They have tended to distinguish themselves from competitors by emphasizing qualitative factors, such as friendliness and quality of service.  A survey on the topic of financial institutions was made of 30 individuals using Kelly's (1955) Repertory Grid technique.  It was found that building societies were perceived as distinct from banks in terms of traditional functions.  Building societies were generally considered more friendly, and banks were perceived as more efficient and businesslike.  Building societies have a competitive edge in terms of their favorable image, which they should emphasize in their attempts to develop stronger corporate identities.

T1  - A Repertory Grid Analysis of Austria's Image as a Summer Vacation Destination
AN  - 217447123; 00442413
AB  - The appropriateness of Kelly's (1955) repertory grid technique to destination image research is demonstrated.  Images held by UK vacationers of Austria as a summer destination were investigated.  A sample of 25 individuals matching middle-class and opinion-leadership characteristics were asked questions concerning recent vacations, future vacations, and countries to elicit names of countries.  Minimum context form (triadic method) was used to elicit constructs.  Respondents then located each country on a 5-point rating scale to match their image of the destination.  The respondents generated 296 constructs from 17 elements, and 3,062 ratings of 17 nations were obtained.  Content analysis reduced the constructs into 11 clusters.  In general, Austria was seen as an attractive destination for a summer vacation; 8 of the 25 participants rated it at the highest point.  The image data generated by the grid have the potential for more validity than those produced by structured questionnaires.

T1  - Construct System Organization and Schizophrenia: The Role of Construct Integration
AN  - 848853860
AB  - Personal construct psychology researchers frequently have linked a low degree of construct relatedness to schizophrenia. However, researchers also have found a low degree of construct relatedness to be predictive of accuracy in person perception tasks. Attempting to clarify this, Landfield (1977,1980) proposed that the schizophrenic's construing is characterized by both a low degree of construct integration and a low degree of construct relatedness. The role of both these variables was explored by administering repertory grids to 20 schizophrenic and 20 nonschizophrenic adult psychiatric inpatients. The linkage of schizophrenia to both a low degree of construct relatedness and a low degree of construct integration was supported. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Repertory Grid Methodology and the Analysis of Group Perceptions in Retailing
AN  - 198035495; 00433968
AB  - The use and potential of Repertory Grid Methodology and Personal Construct Theory (Kelly, 1955) in attitude measurement in retailing is investigated.  Researchers have been attracted to the Kelly theory because of its objectivity and the chance of obtaining a group viewpoint.  Case studies using the methodology include: 1.  students' shopping patterns (Hudson, 1974), 2.  shopping centers (Timmermans, Van Der Heijden, and Westerveld, 1982), 3.  comparison shopping -- shoes (Coshall, 1984, 1985), 4.  food shopping -- all store types (Opacic and Potter, 1985, 1986), and 5.  food superstores (Hallsworth, 1987).  The applicability of Kelly's technique was expanded by breaking away from a dependence on the assessment of the opinions of less than 100 persons.  The overriding advantage of the technique is its objectivity; it does not permit researchers to impose ideas on the subjects.  Constructs derived from retail applications of Kelly-type analysis are usually meaningful and easily understood by third parties, but the method can be very time-consuming.  This is reflected often in its sample sizes.

T1  - Beyond Focus Groups: A Thrift's Guide to Market Research
AN  - 204607160; 00369249; 00130408
AB  - Market research has become increasingly important for thrifts in today's competitive environment.  Market research helps assess the potential market for a proposed technology or define the factors that influence consumer behavior.  There are several research methods available to augment the traditional focus groups and telephone surveys.  For example, individual, in-depth interviews can overcome the problems of focus group research aimed at busy, affluent customers.  A more cost-effective alternative are Teledepth interviews, conducted by telephone, which can cover a wider and more diverse geographic area.  If the "group effect" is needed, a Telegroup can be used.  These are focus groups conducted by teleconferencing.  The Knowledge/Attitudes/Practices study combines quantitative and qualitative research to examine an individual's assumptions and behavior.  The Kelly Repertory Grid helps determine exactly which dimensions consumers use to evaluate and make purchasing decisions.  Finally, segmentation analysis can help thrifts target the subcategories in an overall financial market.

T1  - Cognitive Performance Appraisal -- Mapping Managers' Category Structures Using the Grid Technique
AN  - 214807150; 00377095
AB  - The repertory grid technique, a systematic method for eliciting the constructs that make up a person's cognitive structure, permits the mapping of a manager's frame of reference toward employee performance.  After selecting the elements to be used in obtaining managers' reference frames toward employee performance, the logical elements, i.e., the employees under the manager's supervision, are divided randomly into triads.  The manager is asked to show ways in which each combination of 2 employees varies from a 3rd.  This typically generates a construct mix related to personal traits of the employee and job performance.  The manager differentiates between triads until all personal constructs are exhausted and, by using a 5- or 7-point scale, rates the extent to which each employee is characterized by each construct.  Rating all elements in terms of all constructs produces a standard matrix or grid.  Several indexes can be constructed on the basis of the completed grid: 1.  frame differentiation, 2.  frame complexity, 3.  frame integration, 4.  construct centrality, and 5.  construct ranking.

T1  - Repertory Grid Combined with Learning Styles: A Pilot Study
AN  - 214112858; 00365817
AB  - The preferences of a learner are important to consider when attempting to make a learning event effective.  Honey and Mumford (1986) defined 4 basic learning styles: 1.  activists, 2.  reflectors, 3.  theorists, and 4.  pragmatists.  A research project, designed to investigate the learning style of individuals and to use the results to help in personal coaching and development sessions, used the Repertory Grid technique in combination with Honey and Mumford's Learning Style Questionnaire (LSQ).  The Repertory Grid is a method of understanding and structuring how people perceive things and make distinctions between various aspects of their environment.  During the study, each individual was given the Repertory Grid to complete, then asked to complete the LSQ.  The difference between each set of ratings was noted, as well as the ratings depicting "learned the most" and "learned the least." All the study's participants felt the results were indicative of their personal learning styles.

T1  - A Behavioural Analysis of Demand Elasticities
AN  - 220674107; 00344017
AB  - Based on ideas from personal construct psychology, it is proposed that people feel attached or strongly desire to become attached to specific consumption pathways because they assess that doing otherwise would entail implications of a predominately negative kind with respect to their abilities to understand the complex and uncertain world around them.  Information-processing problems may cause consumers to be unable to compute the overall implications of alternative strategies when market conditions alter.  Therefore, they may use simplifying decision methods that may conflict with the principle of substitution.  The research program of personal construct psychology includes a set of research techniques for revealing ways in which individuals view the world, and 3 of these techniques are: 1.  repertory grid, 2.  construct laddering, and 3.  Hinkle's (1965) implication grid.  These 3 tools show the implications to the consumer of choosing one of the action schemes over the others.

AN  - 196846819; 00306592
AB  - PA Consultants (London) has developed the criterion-referenced interview, which can provide structure to employment interviews because it is based on detailed analysis of the job.  Focal points of the analysis include: 1.  tasks associated with the job, 2.  personal characteristics, and 3.  the organization's culture.  Two approaches can assist supervisors in moving from general impressions to specific professional and personal qualities in their interviewing questions -- Kelley's Repertory Grid and Flanagan's Critical Incident.  A panel of supervisors and managers should use a list of observable behaviors to rank those behaviors according to: 1.  how important each is to reaching and maintaining a superior level of performance, and 2.  how frequently each one is required in a typical time period.  Having the job criteria clearly in mind is the key to using the criterion-referenced interview.

T1  - A Measure of the Integrative Complexity of Personal Constructs
AN  - 848853288
AB  - A repertory grid measure of the integrative complexity of personal constructs is described. The grid is proposed as a measure of a subject's use of comprehensive abstract constructs to integrate and direct the sampling of characteristics used in forming impressions of people. The grid method is based on principles described by Piaget as characterizing the stage of formal operations. At the stage of formal operations, the child uses abstract constructions of what is possible to direct the exploration of what is available to experience. The use of such abstract organizing constructs is referred to here as "integrative complexity." Grid scores of integrative complexity were found to match simulations of the progressive integration versus fragmentation of constructions. The grid scores were also found to correlate with Crockett's measure of level of organization in impression formation. The results support the credibility of the coordinate grid measure of integrative complexity

T1  - Using Repertory Grids for Problem Construction
AN  - 231252923; 00258966
AB  - Repertory grid theory (Kelly, 1955) was originally developed as a practical means of mapping an individual's perceptions of reality.  Recently, repertory grids have gained the attention of operations researchers as a tool for analyzing large, ill-defined decision problems.  Grid theory is discussed, and grid construction in application to a simple decision problem involving a single individual, along with the use of rating scales to measure preferences for decision alternatives, is demonstrated.  Application of grid theory and techniques is then extended to operations research problems, and alternative methods of problem construction, including cognitive mapping, are examined.  It is concluded that grids offer a coherent approach to problem construction in operations research, but are not necessarily preferable to other methods of problem analysis.

AB  - The paper presents an ideographic research approach that is being developed to describe the career biographies of individual teachers. These 'portrayals' were seen as a means for exploring the notion of professional development and the personal and contextual conditions that bear upon it. Interviews, together with a variation on the repertory grid technique, were used with two experienced teachers as the means for constructing their phenomenological life-worlds. Implications for in-service education policies and strategies are drawn from the case studies, and a case is presented for the importance of developing models of teacher development complementary to models of curriculum innovation.

AN  - 215394562; 00250763
AB  - The problem-centered approach to management team development is preferable to packaged team building approaches that often make erroneous assumptions about problems to be solved.  The problem-centered method uses actual work problems and begins with an accurate diagnosis of problems and the development of strategies to resolve them.  Repertory grids and identity matrices are used to analyze similarities, differences, and group perceptions of relationships among team members.  Once problems are identified, problem-centered activity begins.  It includes: 1.  expression of the problems, 2.  sharing of perceptions of the problems, 3.  the consensus of the nature of the problems, 4.  the development of solutions, 5.  the allocation of responsibility for solutions, and 6.  agreement on follow-up stages.  The use of actual work problems facilitates the transference of learning to the workplace.  Case studies are given that indicate the success of this approach.

AB  - The sex-role stereotypes held by heterosexual and homosexual men were examined by comparing their Repertory Grid scores. It was found that homosexual men held less rigid sex-role stereotypes than heterosexuals. Degree of opposite-sex identification was marginally greater in homosexuals, but neither group showed strong masculine or feminine stereotypic identification. Homosexual men perceived themselves as psychologically more distant from their fathers than did their heterosexual counterparts; this was probably an effect of homosexuality rather than a cause.

T1  - An Algorithm for the Cluster Analysis of Repertory Grids in Human Resource Development
AN  - 214807914; 00196950
AB  - The Repertory Grid can be used as a descriptive technique for describing the construct systems of varied respondents across a range of applications.  An analysis of the basic grid and its variations in the area of personnel management and training demonstrated its strengths and weaknesses.  The primary advantage of grids is that they are a powerful way to describe individual cases, giving a detailed account of data from an individual employee.  The main disadvantage of grids is that they generate large amounts of idiosyncratic data that are less useful for statistical analysis.  One method of cluster analysis used in occupational settings is Focus.  In its original form as a computer program, Focus results in easily interpretable information from single grids; in its aggregated version, Sociogrid, Focus lends itself to the interpretation of sets of grids.  The cluster analysis is presented as an algorithm for computation by hand in a nonstatistical, straightforward format with some illustrative case material to suggest its applicability in personnel practice.

AB  - A common problem of all cognitive-behavioural models of destination choice is that of the identification of factors influencing the behaviour of interest. This paper considers the applicability of Kelly's repertory grid methodology to identify the factors influencing consumer choice of shopping centres. Firstly, some methodological issues in the assessment of the relative importance people attach to certain variables in deciding where to shop are discussed. Secondly, the main findings of an application of the repertory grid methodology are presented. The paper concludes by discussing some implications of the measurement of the determinants of choice behaviour and the construction of mathematical models of destination choice.

T1  - Short research note: Stress among air traffic controllers: occupational sources of coronary heart disease risk SUMMARY
AN  - 227195111
AB  - This study attempts to assess the sources of occupational stress on air traffic controllers. It is based on data collected from a majority of air traffic controllers at a large U.K. airport. There are two unique methodological features described in this article. First, the use of the repertory grid technique as a method of generating work stressor variables, and second, the use of the multiple logistic equation as a coronary heart disease risk index.

T1  - Allocation of Repertory Grid Constructs to Superordinate Categories: Interjudge Reliability
AN  - 1970427613
AB  - After using a form of the Repertory Grid technique to elicit from teachers constructs of the characteristics of children with behaviour problems, the authors and four other judges allocated the constructs to superordinate categories.Some research reports have indicated that the criterion for interjudge reliability has been product moment correlations of the number of constructs allocated to categories. It is possible that such a method may lead to misinterpretation.Interjudge reliabilities, expressed by product moment correlations, were high when number of constructs was considered. However, an investigation carried out to ascertain percentages of same constructs allocated to the categories revealed that relatively low percentages of constructs were so allocated.

T1  - Toward a Cognitive Methodology of Organizational Assessment
AN  - 236285213; 00135729
AB  - An objective method for describing an organization in terms of its members' subjective, cognitive structures is presented.  The method is an adaptation of the Kelly Repertory Grid.  It produces a description of an organization's cognitive infrastructure.  Practitioners will find the method useful for most kinds of organizational research.  However, it is particularly suitable for the study of organizations with novel organizational structures: those composed of independent teams or other innovative forms of organizational structuring.  People's behavior in organizations is best understood in terms of their mental sets-conceptual frameworks-rather than in terms of needs or personality traits.  Major changes in cognitive structure are the result of a basic shift of constructs about natural phenomena.  Considering the infinite possibilities for cognitive structure, organizational assessment is more a matter of ideographic analysis than of measurement.  The study of organizations should be a study of perceptions as much as it is a study of observable social structure.

T1  - Investigating occupational stress: a methodological approach: SUMMARY
AN  - 227214073
AB  - One of the main methodological difficulties in carrying out research in the field of occupational stress is the use of pre-designed health and behavioural questionnaires. This has the serious disadvantage of either not including important stressors at work or distorting the importance of those that are included. This article describes the use of the Repertory Grid technique in identifying sources and manifestations of occupational stress which overcomes this obstacle. A detailed description of the Grid technique as it was applied to air traffic controllers is provided.

T1  - An Analysis of Three Managerial Jobs Using Repertory Grids
AN  - 194217234; 00124307
AB  - Accurate job analysis is the basis of industrial psychology, and it should provide the framework for decisions about: 1.  selection, 2.  training, 3.  job evaluation, and 4.  organization.  A repertory grid approach to job analysis is a technique that can be applied to the jobs of individual managers.  This technique enables a psychologist to produce a representation of an individual's ''mental model'' pictured as a mental map or dendrogram.  The subjects were 3 managers employed by a large chain of bakers in the north-west of England.  The repertory grid approach was used to define the 3 management jobs.  The results showed that the repertory grid analysis allowed for a more systematic and quantitative analysis, as it identifies: 1.  the most demanding tasks, 2.  the most important qualities, and 3.  the number and nature of any underlying trends.  The repertory grid analysis has the advantage of producing a pictorial representation of a job by plotting the position of each part of a job by using the loadings on the first 2 components as if they were references on a map.

T1  - The Repertory Grid in Action: How to Use It to Conduct an Attitude Survey
AN  - 214110878; 00109517
AB  - The Repertory Grid Technique (Repgrid) may be the best method of discovering people's attitudes or beliefs.  Using the Repgrid as the basis for conducting an attitude survey is the most ambitious of its uses.  While the Repgrid is a survey, it is not a questionnaire.  Managers responding to the survey rate their peers on a numerical basis, according to common traits in handling people.  Then, strong points and weaknesses are listed, along with traits that make some different from others.Analyzing the results is more difficult and is the most crucial phase in the entire exercise.  A 7-step procedure facilitates analysis: 1.  Number the forms.  2.  Score the forms.  3.  Extract top data.  4.  Extract tail data.  5.  Sort and categorize data.  6.  Compare top and tail data.  7.  Produce summary pen pictures.Feeding back the results of the survey in a face-to-face meeting with management is preferred to a written report.  Participants may receive a written summary.  Total time spent should take around 36 hours.

T1  - The Study of Personnel Management as an Occupation, Using Repertory Grid
AN  - 214814717; 00101081
AB  - Part of a research project which examined personnel management as an occupational specialism is described.  The main intention is to understand personnel managers' values and beliefs and the settings which give rise to them.  This objective can be approached through the occupational community or the organizational context of personnel work.   This research draws on Kelly's personal construct theory by examining the way 20 personnel specialists in 4 organizations interpret and make meaningful the roles of others encountered in their working world.  These constructs were discovered by using a repertory grid technique, and results from the 4 organizations are compared.  Possible explanations are suggested of the ways in which the personnel specialists studied coped with values that conflict with their own and of how they are able to integrate within their organization's culture.  Results suggest that the way managers are subjected to competing pressures produces an adaptive response.

T1  - An Exploration of Occupational Role: An Exercise in Team Development
AN  - 214808375; 00093895
AB  - Personal Construct Theory (PCT), coupled with implications and repertory grids, was used to analyze the attitudes and perceptions a team of professional valuers in a British Local Authority held about their positions and functions.  The study sought to discover why officers with identical functions and similar qualifications and experience evaluated analogous situations and reached radically different conclusions.   Computer analysis of the grids used did point up constructs and elements with very little consensus among the officers.  The data provided were of little use to the officers themselves and required trained interpretation and application.  In the case study, a more effective and consistent team of professionals was formed when differences in personal constructs were pointed out to them.
