# Repertory Grid Technique
The purpose of this repo is to provide evidence-based tools and information about using the Repertory Grid Technique in educational (particularly higher education) contexts.

I am conducting a systematic scoping review as a major component of my PhD thesis, and want to make useful contributions to the literature by identifying case studies and techniques that are effective and purposeful.

I chose Repertory Grid Technique because it allows observation and comparison over time of individual and group constructs around the system of interest. It is language-agnostic, culturally adaptable, and respects diverse worldviews in a way that can help mental model alignment, facilitate agreement and consensus, and generate commitment to shared problem-solving and teamwork.

In July 2020, the focus of my thesis changed substantially, to now focus tightly on the Repertory Grid Technique and the value it can add to other design and research contexts. [Read the newest overview here.](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/chapters/105_outline_v4.pdf)
