# Repertory Grid Technique
The purpose of this repo is to provide evidence-based tools and information about using the Repertory Grid Technique in educational (particularly higher education) contexts.

I am conducting a systematic scoping review as a major component of my PhD thesis, and want to make useful contributions to the literature by identifying case studies and techniques that are effective and purposeful.

I chose Repertory Grid Technique because it allows observation and comparison over time of individual and group constructs around the system of interest. It is language-agnostic, culturally adaptable, and respects diverse worldviews in a way that can help mental model alignment, facilitate agreement and consensus, and generate commitment to shared problem-solving and teamwork.

In July 2020, [the focus of my thesis changed substantially, to now focus tightly on the Repertory Grid Technique and the value it can add to other design and research contexts](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/chapters/050-intro-1.md). And then, unfortunately, because of the Covid pandemic, I was forced to change my PhD topic as my major data collection did not proceed.

This project will be further updated in late 2022.

### Peter quick check-in

Update Wednesday 28 October
Moving to [Word chapters](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ea50sjy8m0aguhl/AACoMbIydLtpo9gc2QSEiYOBa?dl=0) for a more finished product.

Update Wednesday 19 September
Finished checking part 1 of SSR, writing part 2. Realise I am still in elaboration mode so my plan is to
- finish SSR stage 2 to the point where I am ready to go through all the citations added since the project started last year
- put it aside while I re-write the three sections of Thesis part 1 (the top row) of the thesis
- edit SSR as a whole, decide on audience, write for feedback, save edits for method/qda separate paper
- discuss feedback on Thesis part 1
- re-write Thesis part 2
- re-write Thesis part 3

Of course, happy to adapt where necessary, thought it would be a good easy way to check progress / ask questions.

* Something that I think is very interesting in the phenomenographic approach is the idea that phenomenographic categories of description are hierarchical. And finite. Does this mean RepGrid could model all possible ways of understanding a concept as a hierarchy and use that model to dynamically develop scaffolds or do something useful with Learning Analytics, or, better, find ways of varying the inputs to create brand new models (loving Marton's variation theory)
