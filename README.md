# Repertory Grid Technique
The purpose of this repo is to provide evidence-based tools and information about using the Repertory Grid Technique in educational (particularly higher education) contexts.

I am conducting a systematic scoping review as a major component of my PhD thesis, and want to make useful contributions to the literature by identifying case studies and techniques that are effective and purposeful.

I chose Repertory Grid Technique because it allows observation and comparison over time of individual and group constructs around the system of interest. It is language-agnostic, culturally adaptable, and respects diverse worldviews in a way that can help mental model alignment, facilitate agreement and consensus, and generate commitment to shared problem-solving and teamwork.

In July 2020, [the focus of my thesis changed substantially, to now focus tightly on the Repertory Grid Technique and the value it can add to other design and research contexts](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/chapters/050-intro.md).

### Peter quick check-in
Update Tuesday 18 August
1. Writing a [summary of phenomenography and the similarities it shares with PCT and the Repertory Grid Technique](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/chapters/230-phenomenography.md)**
2. Auditing which full-texts I have, which are available at the Library and which need to be ordered; ordering the items.
3. Finish SSR [this by mid-September at latest, works which haven't arrived from ordering can be done after I do the next thing]
4. Re-write my data-based chapters to include what a -og- perspective would make of the data.
5. Based on best option studies, model how RepGrid could be used as well as providing a working server purpose-designed for that specific process (eg the one I've set up for Andrew Allan). You'll be out of Quarantine by time I get to this bit so I'll show you more about what that looks like then.

Of course, happy to adapt where necessary, thought it would be a good easy way to check progress / ask questions.

** Something that I think is very interesting in the phenomenographic approach is the idea that phenomenographic categories of description are hierarchical. And finite. Does this mean RepGrid could model all possible ways of understanding a concept as a hierarchy and use that model to dynamically develop scaffolds or do something useful with Learning Analytics, or, better, find ways of varying the inputs to create brand new models (loving Marton's variation theory)  **

Wed 26 EN meltdown continues, dentist in Sydney
Thurs 27  49 + reconnecting scoping review and making sure documentation is clear so far, found MAXQDA licence has expired so uploading documentation for student licence, fixed EN
Fri 28 still trying to get my head into the SSR, a good opportunity to double check the data from each step so far, might as well do it now.
