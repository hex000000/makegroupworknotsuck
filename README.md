# Repertory Grid Technique
The purpose of this repo is to provide evidence-based tools and information about using the Repertory Grid Technique in educational (particularly higher education) contexts.

I am conducting a systematic scoping review as a major component of my PhD thesis, and want to make useful contributions to the literature by identifying case studies and techniques that are effective and purposeful.

I chose Repertory Grid Technique because it allows observation and comparison over time of individual and group constructs around the system of interest. It is language-agnostic, culturally adaptable, and respects diverse worldviews in a way that can help mental model alignment, facilitate agreement and consensus, and generate commitment to shared problem-solving and teamwork.
