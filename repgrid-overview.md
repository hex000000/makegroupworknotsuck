# Repertory Grid Technique

Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) was developed by psychologist George Kelly [1] as a sense-making tool based in the client’s reality, which could allow therapists to see that reality without imposing the therapist’s beliefs on the client (Fransella, Bell, & Bannister, 2004) [2]. Kelly's Personal Construct Psychology has a number of foundational principles, beginning with the "individuality corollary", which is that every individual construes the world differently.

It has been used to foreground tacit knowledge in management decision-making (Jankowicz, 2001) [3], and to elicit the knowledge expert systems require (Ananth, Nazareth & Ramamurthy, 2011n [4]; Boose, 1985 [5]), and has precedents for its use in education. Aditomo, Calvo & Reimann (2011) [6] used the technique to connect perceptions about learning activities to writing performance. Their study found RGT a “useful and practically viable” approach revealing both whether and how high and low performing participants construed their collaborative writing task, and the specific combinations of elements and constructs that students prefer. Vatrapu et al. (2012) [7] developed an online RGT tool allowing teachers to monitor learners’ knowledge structures in real time, seeing what concepts they thought of as similar/dissimilar. Both synchronous and asynchronous use of RGT are feasible and useful for eliciting, sharing and elaborating on mental models in a collaborative context.

Chapter 2 of Jankowicz (2005) [3] is a thorough but uncomplicated overview of the technique and theory behind it.

While RGT can be used without mediating technology, implementation in our collaborative environment can operate as a shared visualisation and problem-solving tool as well as providing rich data helping to inform design decisions for both learners and instructors.The example below was created for the Curtis, Wells, Higbee and Lowry paper [8] which really inspired me about RepGrid (very easy to read, and freely available).

![Figure 1 shows the matrix of elements, constructs and scores](https://github.sydney.edu.au/crli/repgrid/blob/master/images/Curtis-Fig-1.png "Figure 1 (Curtis et al., 2008 (p. 40)")

>"Figure 1 shows a sample repgrid, created as an illustration for this paper. The purpose of this grid might be to understand how an individual perceives different email programs. Within the figure, the labels along the bottom of the repgrid identify the elements. In the original RGT methodology created by Kelly, elements were always people; however, over time researchers have examined many different objects as elements. In Figure 1, the elements are email programs. Labels along the sides of the grid comprise the bipolar personal constructs, and the numeric values within the grid represent the individual’s ratings of the elements along each individual construct. The RGT provides a technique in which the interviewer and the participant create the repgrid by defining the elements, identifying the constructs, and rating each element on each construct." (Curtis, Wells, Higbee & Lowry, 2008, Figure 1, p. 40).

The example above is one that might arise in gathering requirements for an email system, or deciding which of the email systems to retain. You can see one participant's responses to being asked about email programs.  The red email program names are elements, responses to being asked a question like "when you think about email programs, what comes to mind?".

Then, the system presents three elements and asks the participant a question like _"**AIM**, **Hotmail** and **Yahoo**; select one that is different from the other two and use a word that explains why that is different and the others are more the same"._  In the example above, one differentiation (among others) is the continuum that runs from _Simple Layout_ to _Cluttered_. The participant rates **AIM** and **Hotmail** highly on the _Simple Layout_ end, scoring 6 and 7 (out of a possible 7) respectively. They differentiate **Yahoo** as _Cluttered_ by only rating it a 3 out of possible 7.

On another construct continuum, though, the participant has rated **AIM** and **Yahoo** as different from **Hotmail**, with **Hotmail** scoring a 7 (out of a possible 7) for file storage capacity, and **AIM** and **Yahoo** only 2 and 3 respectively.

One way in which this data can be used is to see which elements are most similar. **Free Eudora**'s total score is 61, so it is more closely related to **Outlook Express** at 51 than, say, **Yahoo**, which with a total score of 30, is 31 points distant. The red tree is these differences normalised on a 1-100 scale, where zero representing no similarity in constructs, and 100 represents total similarity. So, for example, **Gmail** compared with an **'Ideal'** system is around 80% similarity (quite a lot), and **Gmail** compared with **Hotmail** is around 55% similarity (not a lot).

It is easy to create your own grid, then view and download the results. There are examples of single and multiple grids on the public [WebGridPlus](http://grid.eilab.ca/) page and you can also create your own cache in which to compare responses. A caveat, again,  please download and save your work regularly.
